Before we continue, let me remind you that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including predictions, estimates, projections, or other statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those mentioned in these forward-looking statements, as a result of risks and uncertainties. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is discussed in our most recent Form 10-K,10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, we will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. I will now turn the call over to Gary.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Liz. In our second fiscal quarter of 2025, Applied Materials delivered strong results across the board, including record earnings per share. These results reflect great execution by our teams around the world, as well as the agility and flexibility we have in our global operations and supply chain. While we are paying close attention to a highly dynamic macro environment, we have not seen significant changes in market demand. Our customers remain focused on winning the race to be first-to-market with transformative new technologies. Applied is working closely with our customers and partners to accelerate the industry’s roadmap. We are very well-positioned at major technology inflections in fast-growing areas of the market, which supports our multi-year growth trajectory. In my prepared remarks today, I’ll provide our latest market outlook, I’ll explain how Applied’s innovative products and services are enabling fundamental advances in semiconductor technology, and I’ll describe how we are translating these innovations into sustainable, profitable growth across our business. Starting with our perspective on the market: the major technology trends reshaping the global economy, including IoT, automation and robotics, electric and autonomous vehicles, and clean energy, are all built on top of advanced semiconductors. Central to our future market outlook is AI, which is the most transformative technology of our lifetimes and has almost limitless potential use cases. While we are seeing remarkable progress in AI capabilities, we are still in the early phases of a multi-decade build out of applications and infrastructure. Large scale deployment of AI will require major advances in computing performance and energy efficiency that can only be achieved through disruptive innovation across the technology stack. These requirements are reshaping the semiconductor roadmap and changing the way chips are designed and manufactured. The impact of AI datacenter innovation and investments is apparent in the wafer fab equipment market, where there are significant shifts in the spending mix this year. We see investment in leading edge foundry-logic growing substantially in 2025, and we also expect spending for leading-edge DRAM to be up significantly. We see lower spending in China with investments in both DRAM and mature logic down for the year. And, finally, we are seeing an uptick in NAND investment, albeit from the very low levels seen over the past several years. Against this market backdrop, Applied is well positioned for 2025 and beyond. In 2024, we under-performed the market in China, due to the market access restrictions imposed on U.S. companies. At the same time, outside of China, we grew faster than our peer group thanks to our strength in leading edge foundry and DRAM. Trade restrictions have also had an impact on our service business. Despite these headwinds, we grew our core parts and services revenues in the low double-digit range last year, and we are on track to deliver a similar growth rate in 2025. On top of our growing installed base, we are successfully increasing the portion of those systems in the field covered by higher-value, advanced services, and comprehensive service agreements. More than two-thirds of our service revenue comes from subscriptions, and we expect this percentage to further increase in the coming years. At a company-level, through 2024, Applied Materials has grown revenues for five consecutive years. This momentum continues in 2025. If we take our first half results plus our third quarter guide, revenues are up 7% year-to-date. Looking further ahead, we also believe we are in a great position for the future given the direction of the industry roadmap, our strong leadership positions at key device architecture inflections, and the unique portfolio of solutions and capabilities we provide to our customers. Customers are racing to be first-to-market to deliver major architecture innovations in logic, compute memory, packaging, and power devices including next generation gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery, 4F2 and 3D DRAM, advanced packaging, compound semiconductors for power electronics, and silicon photonics. These technology inflections grow the market for wafer fab equipment, increase the relative mix of materials engineering technologies, and provide opportunities for Applied to gain market share. Advanced foundry-logic is a great example of this. If we compare an advanced fab using integrated gate-all-around and backside power delivery architecture to the last generation of FinFET technology, Applied’s revenue opportunity is approximately 30% higher for the equivalent fab capacity. In advanced DRAM, we are focused on addressing the most-critical steps for next-generation technologies and this has enabled us to establish a strong leadership position in this market. In 2025, we expect our revenues from advanced DRAM customers to grow more than 40% as they ramp investments in DDR-5 and high-bandwidth memory. Across advanced foundry-logic and DRAM, we are introducing innovative new solutions that are being rapidly adopted by the market. One example is our Sym3 Magnum etch system for advanced patterning, which has generated more than $1.2 billion of revenue since we launched the product in February 2024. Another example is our breakthrough Cold Field Emission eBeam technology that has strong momentum in gate-all-around and high bandwidth memory, and supported record revenues for our Process Diagnostics and Control business this past quarter. As we look at how the industry’s roadmap is evolving, we see our broad capabilities and connected product portfolio as a major leadership strength. This gives us earlier visibility and a more holistic view of the industry’s most valuable technical opportunities, it allows us to develop solutions to address those high-value opportunities faster, and most importantly, it means we can deliver unique solutions by co-optimizing and combining our innovations. With the pace of technology accelerating, being first to market has incredible value for our customers and Applied Materials. For this reason, another key pillar of our strategy is high-velocity co innovation. Our goal is to increase the speed of developing and commercializing next-generation technologies through earlier and deeper collaboration with customer and partners. Applied’s global EPIC platform is designed to support this strategy by providing unique physical and digital infrastructure to accelerate learning rates and optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of R&D resources. Construction of our new flagship R&D facility, the EPIC Center in Silicon Valley is progressing on schedule, and we expect the center to start operations in Spring 2026. Before I hand over to Brice, I’ll quickly summarize. First, while we recognize that the macro environment is highly dynamic, Applied continues to deliver strong financial performance. We are not currently seeing significant changes in customer demand, and we have agility in our global operations to adapt to a range of scenarios. Second, the race to deliver high-performance, energy-efficient AI computing remains the dominate driver of the semiconductor industry’s roadmap. Applied is best positioned at the major device architecture inflections that will enable that roadmap to be realized. And third, we are seeing strong traction with our high-velocity co-innovation strategy where earlier and deeper collaboration with our customers and partners is enabling us to bring next-generation technology to market faster than ever before. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Brice.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Gary, and thank you to everyone joining us for today’s call. We delivered another strong quarter in fiscal Q2, with robust year-over-year revenue growth, gross margin expansion and record earnings per share. These excellent results were driven by increased leading-edge foundry-logic investments, given the strong end-market demand for AI-enabling semiconductors. This performance was achieved within the rapidly evolving economic and trade policy environment of the past several months, and we leveraged our global supply chain and diversified manufacturing footprint to successfully navigate the dynamic commercial landscape. With strong profitability and record earnings per share, we increased shareholder capital distributions during Q2, with approximately $2 billion in dividends and share repurchases, and bought back approximately 1.4% of shares outstanding. Turning to the details for Q2, our results were largely in line with our expectations, with total net revenue of approximately $7.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year, with growth across all our business segments. Non-GAAP gross margin was 49.2%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, and our highest quarterly gross margin since fiscal year 2000. The strong margin performance in Q2 was primarily driven by a favorable mix of our products and business segments. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.3 billion, down slightly as a percentage of revenue on a year-over-year basis, with growth in R&D partially offset by decreases in G&A, as we focused on funding critical technology inflection-related research. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $2.39, up 14% year-over-year, given the revenue growth, better profitability and share repurchases. Moving to the segments, Semiconductor Systems revenue was $5.26 billion for Q2, up 7% year-over-year, with growth in foundry-logic, as customer investments at the leading edge more than offset declines for the ICAPS nodes that serve the IoT, Communications, Automotive, Power and Sensor markets; and growth in NAND upgrades more than offsetting year over-year declines in DRAM. Non-GAAP operating margin of 36.4% was up 150 basis points year-over-year. Moving to Applied Global Services, AGS delivered revenue of $1.57 billion in Q2, up 2% year-over- year, as healthy growth in services more than offset the expected decline in sales of 200-millimeter equipment. Non-GAAP operating margin of 28.5% was flat year-over-year. Lastly, our Display business delivered revenue of $259 million, with non-GAAP operating margin of 26.3%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.2 billion and debt of $6.3 billion, and cash from operations in the quarter was approximately $1.6 billion, or 22% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $510 million, up from the year-ago period, and driven by the buildout of Applied Materials’ equipment and process innovation and commercialization center, EPIC, the largest and most advanced facility of its type globally. Free cash flow for Q2 was approximately $1.1 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we increased capital allocation in Q2, with total shareholder distributions of approximately $2 billion, with dividends paid of $325 million and share repurchases of approximately $1.7 billion. As previously announced, during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 15% increase to our dividend per share. This marks another year of healthy growth for our dividend, one of our key capital allocation priorities, and as I like to point out, the dividend and its growth are closely correlated with the recurring revenue and profits in our Services business. We also announced that our Board approved an additional $10 billion share repurchase authorization, and as of the end of the quarter, approximately $15.9 billion, in total, remains available to us for future share repurchases. Turning to our outlook, as we contemplate the year-over-year performance we expect in Q3, we are seeing acceleration from our leading-edge foundry logic products, which are key enablers in the ongoing gate-all-around build out, and which will more than offset a lower level of investment in the ICAPS nodes, following two years of strong spending by these customers. We also expect a stable and healthy DRAM market and growth in NAND, driven by upgrades. Factoring in these views, for fiscal Q3, we expect total revenue of $7.2 billion, plus or minus $500 million, representing a 6% increase year-over-year at the midpoint, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.35, plus or minus $0.20, representing an 11% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect Semiconductor Systems revenue of approximately $5.4 billion, up approximately 10% year-over-year and AGS revenue of approximately $1.55 billion, down 2% year-over year, with growth in core services impacted by the trade restrictions previously disclosed and declines in demand for 200 millimeter equipment. Rounding out the business segments, we expect Display revenue of approximately $250 million. Lastly, given our business mix in Q3, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 48.3% and non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $1.3 billion, and we are modeling a tax rate of approximately 13%. In closing, while the trade environment continues to evolve, our global supply chain and diversified manufacturing capabilities provide us with significant agility and flexibility to respond to changing conditions. In the near term, we see overall demand and customer investments continuing at the expected rate and pace, even in the current environment, and the long-term secular drivers for growth in our business remain intact. We are positioning ourselves to benefit from the opportunities that will emerge as the equipment industry invests to support a $1 trillion-plus semiconductor market by the end of the decade, and we are investing for the growth that we expect in our business over that time. Thank you and we are now ready to begin the Q&A session. Liz?
Liz Morali: Thanks Bryce. To help us reach as many people as we can on today's call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have an additional question, please re-queue and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.
Stacy Rasgon : Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into services in China. So last quarter, you talked about like the incremental hit from the China restrictions across equipment and services. But you -- and we saw the hit, particularly on the AGS segment. But you'd said that you returned to sequential growth in Q3. But this is not sequential growth. This is kind of flattish to maybe even down a little bit sequentially. I guess, what's going on there? Is that just like a bigger hit than expected on 200-millimeter? Or is China worse? And what is our -- how should we be thinking about growth for this business, I guess into the end of year? Do you think it resumes like sequential growth in Q4?
Brice Hill : Hi, Stacy, thanks for the question. So on the AGS, you've got a lot of those elements correct. So what we would say is the core business in Q2 had a record. And we expect the core to grow at low double digits during the year, just like you would expect for that part of the business, even with the impacts we've seen from lower China business due to those trade restrictions. In the quarter, our Q2 and Q3, that's where you have the effects of some of those accounts becoming restricted. So the year-over-year growth -- we just made year-over-year growth for the quarter on AGS. And you are right, it's really the 200-millimeter equipment that slows down significantly during that quarter that makes that look weaker from a performance perspective. So I think the key things that we want our investors to think about is AGS will grow at low double digits going forward, as we digest these trade rules. With our Q3 guidance, you can see that it's marginal quarter-over-quarter in total, where we'll have the full effect of all of those rules. But the core will be growing year-over-year, and we'll see that low double-digit growth for the core for the full year. Going forward, after Q3, you should expect to see the sequential type of growth that you would expect to deliver that low double digit going forward. And then I would just point out just for investors to remember that, yes, we do connect our dividend to the recurring profits for that business. And it is largely a recurring revenue business. So about 90% at this point is recurring revenue with high renewals of multiyear contracts, and about 66% of the business is under those subscription agreements. So pretty strong from a recurring revenue and profit perspective. Thanks for the question.
Stacy Rasgon : But it does seem like the 200-millimeter is weaker than you thought. Like is that correct?
Brice Hill : Yes. I think that is one factor. It might be a little bit less than we thought. And then the second is we expected a little bit more in utilization for the quarter, and utilization stayed about flat for the quarter. So the spares side of the business was also probably not right up to what we expected.
Stacy Rasgon : Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson : Stacy, on 200-millimeter, a lot of that business is tied to power electronics. And long-term, we think that's going to be mid-to-high single-digit growth. But in the near-term, that business is down from where it was at previously. So again, that's one of the things that's causing that business to be weaker in the near-term. But in service, we're driving a lot of service innovation. We have 8,000 tools connected in the field, and I think high confidence that will grow at low double digit going forward.
Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question please.
Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. So if I contrast the sales growth you have versus peers, right, many of them are expecting to grow double digit. You guys are more consistent at this 7%-or-so growth rate. And the perception is your higher ICAPS exposure. So could you help us size what ICAPS is now as a percentage of sales? Do you think it has bottomed? Can it continue to be a headwind? And if you could give us some trends on China versus non-China ICAPS demand for the rest of the year. Thank you.
Brice Hill : Hi, Vivek, thanks for the question. So I guess I would start. Mature logic, ICAPS -- with the ICAPS end-markets, IoT, communication, auto power sensors for us, first thing we would say is we expect mid-to-high single-digit growth across the horizon heading to that $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion market by 2030 from a semi perspective. And when you look inside our business, we're expecting right now -- if you look at semis and AGS, we would say mid-20s percent will be about the share of the China business for us, if that gives you a perspective there. And when we think about China specifically, we are restricted from competing with some -- in some accounts. But for the accounts that we're able to sell to, we think we're performing very well from a share perspective. We expect those markets to grow. And we see that market investing more and more in 28-nanometer going forward. They kind of built out the 50-plus nanometer capacity, is now focusing on 28-nanometer. And we feel like we are very well positioned on 28-nanometer. We've got the world-leading foundry positions in that node. So we are confident that, that 25% for the business is probably a good number to think of without display, and that should grow over time looking forward.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Vivek, maybe just to clarify, the mid-20s as a percentage of our total company revenue is China semi, including equipment and service. So that's kind of that number. And I'm sure you know and other people on the call know, we have a display business that adds a few percent to overall Applied revenue. And what I would add, certainly, we are extremely well-positioned in the big drivers for AI. If you look at high-performance logic, DRAM compute memory, high-bandwidth memory, packaging, power electronics, all of those areas are the fastest-growing areas of the market, very well-positioned there. And as Brice said, in ICAPS, we expect, over time, that will grow kind of mid-to-high single digits. The 28-nanometer investment, as Brice said, is increasing significantly as a percentage of the total in China. And our share there is higher. So that will help us in '25 and also going forward. The other thing I'd say about ICAPS, this has been a focus for us for more than 5 years. We have new products in ICAPS that will enable us to expand into large new segments. We have new products where we have significant cost innovations to better compete in cost-sensitive areas of the market. So I'm optimistic that with all of those different factors, we are going to continue to see strong growth. We’ve grown 5 years previous to this year. We’re growing in the first 3 quarters of ‘25 and I think really well positioned for these key inflections.
Vivek Arya : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.
CJ Muse : Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess, Brice, I wanted to focus on gross margins. I think a quarter ago, you talked about 48.2% as kind of floor reflecting China normalizing, but that would kind of trade tensions or whatnot. It might now be 48%. Was hoping you could kind of update on that. And then longer term, into '26 and beyond can you kind of speak to how you see value-based pricing, cost reductions and balancing manufacturing across both Austin and Singapore and where the trajectory for margins could go? Thank you.
Brice Hill : Thanks, C.J. Good to hear from you. Yes, 48.2%. So obviously, we had 49.2% in the quarter. And we talked about a very -- in the Q2, we talked about a very favorable mix. And our guide is 48.3%. And you are right, we highlighted -- investors might remember last year, we were in the 47s, mid-47s, and we were hoping that we could get it into the 48s. And we've done -- we've made good progress on pricing, cost management and logistics improvements. And so I do feel like the low-48s, probably right around 48.2% to 48.3% is the right level where the company is operating at this point. And that has modest impact from tariffs. So in Q2, very small impact from tariffs because we had inventory positions that were pre-tariff. And then in Q3, in our guidance, also modest effective tariff because you pointed out, we have a very flexible manufacturing operation with a global footprint. We have a global supply chain. We've worked for years since COVID on duplicating sources across the globe. And we'll be making price adjustments for the things that cannot be managed from a tariff perspective. So our guidance for Q3 really reflects being able to manage that environment very well and having the flexibility to manage it very well. Then the last thing to say on the pricing, we do feel like we are making very good progress with value-based pricing and cost management. And I would just say that our expectation is we'll continue to make improvements to that level of margin as we go forward.
Gary Dickerson : Hi, C.J., this is Gary. One thing I would say, aligned with what Brice talked about, we've been driving these cost improvements. We've made a lot of progress there. We're also driving better value capture as we go forward. We're enabling many of these really critical inflections for the industry. And I think the thing that I would focus on here is sustainable margin improvement. We made progress this year. We've been making progress over the last few years. But I really believe that the initiatives that we're driving in cost improvements, the initiatives we're driving in value capture, all of those things will assist going forward. And we'll continue to see progress this year and in future years.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Melissa Weathers from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Melissa Weathers : Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. On the DRAM side of things, it seems like HBM has really helped put a floor in DRAM WFE spending since cyclically, we're still kind of bouncing along the bottom. But HBM does still seem to be driving nice growth. So can you help us understand the puts and takes on how to balance those 2 dynamics going forward? Like how do we think about the cyclical piece of DRAM compared to the HBM upside that you're seeing?
Brice Hill : Okay, Melissa. Yes, thinking about the HBM component, so from a wafer starts perspective, I think in this year, HBM as a component of DRAM should reach 16%. And what we would highlight there is it's growing at a 40% rate, similar to the AI data center-type components on the data center side. So that has put DRAM in total, including HBM equipment, really continuing to operate at very high levels. So at least on our side, I wouldn't say cyclical low. I'd actually say maybe last year was a record year, this year will be close to a record year or it could be a record. DRAM is very strong. And the way we think of it is it's being pulled by that AI leading-edge. And all the compute memory that's needed for that and the HBM is a great example of that. So hopefully, that gives you a perspective. From our side, that business is operating very strongly across all those end technologies.
Gary Dickerson : Yes. Melissa, this is Gary. I would add that -- if you look over -- a little over a decade, we've gained 10 points of market share in DRAM. And this -- the compute-memory is going to be one of the fastest-growing areas of the market over time. So if you look at, especially in the AI data center, that business is growing very quickly. And we talked about with DDR5 and HBM, 40% growth with our top three leading customers. So that business is growing at a high rate, and we are very strongly positioned. If you look at what we've been able to achieve in terms of share gains in DRAM and where the DRAM architectures are going to the future, the next big inflection is 4F2. That architecture is a great opportunity for Applied. We are deeply engaged with all of those different customers. And we will outperform with all of our innovations as that new architecture is adopted. So again, very strong growth in DRAM for Applied, outperformance in the past and well positioned going forward.
Melissa Weathers : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Last couple of earnings calls, you guys have been articulating a leading-edge, foundry-logic and leading-edge memory spending acceleration as we move through the year, which implies that calendar second half spending on leading-edge technologies will be higher versus the first half spend. Is that still the team's view? And then kind of tied to that, right, advanced technology drives more penetration of your integrated system solutions. I think you guys exited last year with integrated solutions representing about 30% of your overall systems business. Where do you anticipate that mix exiting this fiscal year?
Brice Hill : Great. Harlan, good to hear from you. So on the leading edge, definitely accelerating. And what we were highlighting in previous quarters as we sort of were thoughtful about the slower investment rate in ICAPS in the mature technologies after two years of very rapid growth, we were all hoping that leading-edge would begin to accelerate after a lesser year in '24 and '23. And that's exactly what we're seeing. So you see a pickup through the course of the year. That should be matched hopefully by all the things that you see in the market. If you look at the cloud service providers' CapEx, those numbers have only been going up. We've seen recent announcements of new factories and spending from the leading logic companies. So yes, I think we expect that trend to be enduring. When we think about all the technologies that are packed around AI data center, so DRAM, HBM, advanced packaging, and of course, leading logic where there is 100% utilization on the front end there, that is accelerating. And then on the integrated equipment, we're still averaging approximately 30% so you can look at that as growing at the 7% rate -- almost 7% rate that we see the business growing at this point in time.
Harlan Sur: Okay, perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks. I had a clarification and a question. So Brice, I just wanted to clarify what this is for the entire year this year. So I think you were talking about low double-digit growth, but I would assume that the back half is up like 30% half-on-half. So is that really the message where you keep talking about the core part of service? That's what's going to grow low double digit? So can you just tell us what you think the total business will grow for this year? And then my question is, most of the other companies expect WFE to be pretty first half-weighted this year. I know you don't talk about the market as a whole, but can you give us a sense of whether you would also say that markets first half-weighted this year? Thanks.
Brice Hill : Okay, Tim. Thanks. So on the services, yes, when we think about core, we are stripping out the 200-millimeter equipment sales for that. So if you had an estimate in prior years of what those components were, for our core, we're hitting a record in this quarter. We'll have a record next quarter, and we're saying for the whole year, even despite losing -- not being able to serve some of those accounts in China, we will have low double-digit growth in the core business, so without that 200-millimeter. The 200-millimeter will make the overall AGS business growth look much smaller for the year. And so we'll have to see where that lands. But it'll be much smaller for the year. And then for first half, second half, we are talking about three quarters for Applied that are growing almost 7%. And what we would say is the trends that are pulling the business seem fairly durable to us. And we've talked about leading-edge accelerating. So without filling in two more quarters, we'll have to see where that goes. But we haven't seen really a change in the trajectory of demand or the trajectory of those trends in the last 90 days.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. So you have to say that the back half will be pretty flat with the first half? Is that the message?
Brice Hill : It's not really the message. Like I said, we won't fill in those last two quarters. Probably when you're thinking calendar year, that would be our Q4 and part of our Q1. So we are not giving specific guidance for that. But what we would say is almost 7% year-over-year so far, year-to-date for the company. And the trends that are pulling on the market seem fairly durable. So hopefully, that helps.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, guys. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question please.
Krish Sankar: Thanks for the question. I also had a question and a clarification. Gary, just had a longer-term question for you. You are clearly gaining traction in new technologies like gate-all-around, backside power delivery. But when I look at your leadership products more on a unit process specification level, it feels like TBD is moving to ALD. On CVD, Etch and CMP you always had the U.S., Japanese competition, but you have some legit Chinese competition, too, in the segment. So I'm just kind of wondering how to think about your leadership product momentum over the next one year to three years, some of these shifts in competition. And also, can you give any color or rationale on the 9% BESI stake. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson : Sure, Krish. Thanks. So the way I would think about it, if you look at our leadership products, they're really targeted at the biggest inflections that are being driven by AI. And so in high-performance logic, what we've said is that we will -- for gate-all-around and backside power distribution, those are the two big inflections that are going forward, we'll gain share. And we are extremely well-positioned to capture more than 50% of the available opportunity in those inflections. So again, very strongly positioned there. In compute memory and DRAM, again, that's another one that's being driven by AI. And I mentioned that earlier, we gained in a little over a decade about 10 points of share in DRAM. And we're, again, very well positioned in DRAM on the last 6F-Squared nodes. And also for 4F-squared, we're even better positioned. I met in the last month, I think pretty much all of those DRAM CEOs and most of the high-performance logic CEOs, very strong positions, very deep engagements. And then if you look at high-bandwidth memory, we have high share there. Advanced packaging is another one, where there are tremendous architecture inflections. And we're just very, very well positioned. So Krish, again, I have high confidence that we will gain share as those inflections happen. And we have visibility because we have such deep relationships with all of these different customers. And one of the things that everybody is focused on is this theme of high-velocity co-innovation. Everybody is racing to be first to market with those new architecture inflections. Whoever gets there first wins big. Everybody else is left behind. So I think what that's driving is earlier and deeper collaborations with those customers. And so again, we have very high visibility on our positions going forward for all of those major architecture inflections.
Brice Hill : Yes. I got it. And Krish, on BESI, so 5-year relationship with BESI. We recently extended our collaboration agreement, working very well with them. I think you know our perspective on energy-efficient compute is their solution, combined with our solutions for die-to-wafer bonding will be very important for that energy road map going forward. And so we felt -- as we extended the collaboration agreement, we felt that we wanted to make an investment in their company at the same time. And on the 9%, no specific information to share there. We had a lot of investments during the quarter in addition to that with our EPIC facility that we're building, the world-class fab in Sunnyvale and then also the share buybacks that we mentioned. So that was -- that's our -- the information that we have to share there.
Gary Dickerson : Yes. Krish, what I would say also, I've personally been involved working with BESI for many years. They are the leader in die-to-wafer and die-to-die bonding. And our teams have developed an integrated hybrid bonding product with six technologies integrated together. There was a question about integrated products earlier on the call. So in this case, this is a really important innovation for the most advanced in AI memory chips, where again, we have an Applied platform with the BESI bonder along with 5 other technologies. And we think this is going to be a meaningful growth driver going forward and contribute to a very strong growth rate in our advanced packaging business going into the future.
Krish Sankar: Thanks Gary, thanks Brice.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International Group. Your question please.
Mehdi Hosseini : Yeah, thanks for taking my question. This is for the team. What are the key assumptions embedded in the low and the high end of your July quarter revenue guide of $6.7 billion to $7.7 billion?
Brice Hill : Thanks, Mehdi. That's a student observation. We widened our range by $100 million at this point. So it's plus or minus $500 million for the quarter. We had been doing plus or minus $400 million. And it Was really 2 things. We hadn't changed that in the last few years. And so the business is obviously larger. So we typically ask ourselves whether we should increase the range. And then certainly, during this period, as we saw during the quarter, there was a lot of volatility in the macro, in the market, in geopolitical, in trade, et cetera. And so we felt there's a number of scenarios that are being thought about, and so we thought it was a good time to widen the range. So there is nothing algorithmic or mathematical in this selection. We just thought we would indicate that there's more volatility in the environment than typical.
Mehdi Hosseini : And I assume that's more impacting the ICAP business than the leading-edge, which is more strategic, right?
Brice Hill : Could you say again, please?
Gary Dickerson : Yes. Mehdi, I think it really is the revenue size is larger. And there are changes that are happening from a regulatory standpoint, tariffs, those things that create more uncertainty. And so it's really a combination of those two things. But it was a very small change in range. But again, it's just those factors.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you guys.
Gary Dickerson : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. My question is on the NAND business. I know it's a relatively small business for you, but it's up nicely. And I think you are guiding for growth again. On one hand, your customers are talking about taking utilization down. And on the other hand, you and your peers are talking about spending improving. So if you could talk to the sustainability of the NAND growth and what exactly is driving it, I think that would be helpful. Thank you.
Brice Hill : Sure, Srini. This is Brice. Thanks for the question. So on the NAND business, it has ticked up both in our Q2 and in our Q3, obviously, coming from lower levels. But yes, I think for that business, agree that utilization is lower, but most of those investments are made to upgrade process technologies and upgrade factories to the latest nodes. We see low 20s percent bit demand from a growth rate perspective going forward. And the way that the customers have been supplying that is by improving their technologies and advancing those nodes. So most of the business is upgrades, and I would say they don't really change their plans on upgrades. With a change in utilization, they'll focus on having the density advancement they need from a tech perspective. So really, I think it is just that, that these are investments they make with the lead time and they're thinking about upgrading the technology.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timm Schulze-Melander from Redburn Atlantic. Your question please.
Timm Schulze-Melander: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. So I had a question on advanced packaging. And I guess it's a question for Gary here, which is around kind of Applied Materials' appetite for risk. So it's an emerging application. It's obviously growing very fast. But also maybe the technologies that are going to be needed on a 2-year, 3-year, 4-year view in advanced packaging may evolve, may change. And I just maybe wanted to ask kind of what is Applied's appetite for risk for maybe trying new things, new technologies to serve that market. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson : Hi, Tim, so in advanced packaging, this is going to be one of the most important inflections of the industry. How you connect together all of the different high-performance logic, the compute memory, DRAM, high-bandwidth memory, all of those different chiplets and different components, there is going to be tremendous innovation in advanced packaging. So Applied, we've been investing and we're the leader in that market. We've been investing for a number of years with new capabilities. We have an advanced packaging lab in Singapore, a full flow lab, where some of our leading customers are working with us there on these new architectures. So I think we have -- a good thing for us is that we have very high visibility in where the industry is going. And I talked about this concept of high-velocity co-innovation. We are working with our customers to shape the industry road map, I think more than anyone else. And so when we are placing those bets, you talked about appetite for risk, we have pretty high visibility where to place the bets because we are in such deep and connected relationships with the customers. And we have this broad, unique and connected portfolio. So we're in deep relationships with our customers and even our customers' customers as they're looking at inflections in packaging, AI connectivity, those areas. So again, I have very high confidence there, innovations that we are driving that will expand our total available market in packaging. And we're extremely well-positioned. We've grown significantly over the last few years in packaging, 4 times revenue in the last 5 years. And I have high confidence that we'll continue a very high growth rate going forward.
Timm Schulze-Melander: Great. Helpful, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Your question please.
Charles Shi : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question more on China. I think maybe two months ago at SEMICON China, there's a new company called Scaria. They launched 30 new tools, I believe lots of overlap with AMAT's portfolio. But I think the common perception based on what I'm hearing is Applied probably has likely the greater downside and a lot of the peers with all these new companies emerging in China. Wanted to ask if any thoughts you can provide on that particular competitor. And what could be the implications for -- in Applied's market share, especially, I think the team just talked about actually gaining more share in China as the customers more transitioning from 55-nanometer, 40-nanometer to 28-nanometer? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson : Hi, Charles, thanks for the question. So again, just to remind you, China-semi is in the mid-20s, including equipment and services, as a percentage of total company revenue. And as we talked about earlier, 28-nanometer, where the investment is increasing, we have higher share. And I think the most important thing for us is we have a great innovation pipeline in ICAPS. We formed this group more than six years ago. It was actually April 12, 2019, is when we formed the group. And we are driving significant innovations with new products that will expand our markets, new TAM for Applied Materials, new products that have significant cost innovations for cost-competitive areas of the market. So I feel really good about the pipeline that we have going forward, expanding our available market and our ability to compete. And so I think in any of these different industries, the key thing is you have to run faster than competitors. And we have a great team in ICAPS. They've delivered great results. And I would say that I'm pretty positive about the pipeline that we have going forward and our position to drive growth in the ICAPS market into the future.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question please.
Brian Chin: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Gary and Brice, you clearly remain confident on your positioning for the upcoming key technology inflections in Advanced Logic. I think generally, there's some anticipation that 2-nanometer and 16-angstrom nodes can represent at least a few hundred thousand of wafer capacity expansion. I don't imagine your thoughts around significance has changed. However, given the current level of geoeconomic uncertainty, what's your view on pacing here and whether this could cause these investments perhaps to spread out over a longer horizon?
Brice Hill : I guess I'll start, Brian, and thanks for the question. The way we always think of the market is what's driving demand from a wafer perspective. And you look at PCs and smartphones, they've been growing at low single digits. So those are fairly stable markets. But when you look at data center, it's growing at 20%. And if you look at the -- if you carve out the wafers inside that, that are associated with accelerators, graphics, et cetera, so the AI-component of data center, it's growing at 40%. When we look at the leading-edge factories across the industry, they are at 100% utilization. And we all have thought about the gate-all-around technology, especially with backside power delivery, and thought, well, that's a significant improvement in power performance and density for the chip. So it looks like a really good node. That technology looks like a strong node. So we think the trends from a demand perspective are very strong. And we're expecting a significant build-out of that technology. And I think if you look at recent announcements, either cloud service provider CapEx or even the largest foundry, you'll see -- I think you'll see a lot of energy around the road map.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question please.
Chris Caso : Yeah, thank you, good evening. I guess the question we've gone through a lot with your -- how you're kind of shaping up this year and know that it's too early to start talking quantitatively on next year. But I wonder if you could kind of address a little bit about qualitatively next year, kind of where you are feeling better about growth for next year. What are the things that we should be looking for as we build out our WFE models into next year? And what's your level of conviction that next year is indeed a growth year?
Brice Hill : Hi, Chris, great question. So the way we think about it is we kind of set that anchor $1 trillion to $1.3 trillion in 2030 for the semi industry. And you can use a range of assumptions for what the equipment intensity might be associated with that. And that will give you a pretty significant growth in the equipment business over the next 5 years. And so probably just like you, when you model, we don't try to pick the uneven growth that one-year might describe. We have -- we modeled pretty smooth growth from here to 2030, riding AI, riding the AI data center, all the key technologies that we are describing when we think about robotics and large language models and all those types of things. We think those are strong demand drivers. So what we would say is those are enduring trends, and you can see the industry making the investments right now. You look at the cloud service providers, you look at the foundries, you look at us with the investment we are making in our lab here in Sunnyvale and our platform for innovation across the world. So I think those are the signals that you should look for is are the companies making those investments? And do we expect that trend to continue. I know people always want to know if after five years of growth for Applied, and we are growing at 7% so far this year, year-to-date everybody wants to know if the next quarter after this one will be down or if next year will be down. We really don't model it that way. We just have kind of a smooth growth to that 2030, and we understand it will be uneven.
Liz Morali : And we have time for one last question. Thanks.
Operator: And our final question for today is a follow-up from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.
Stacy Rasgon : Apologies. Thank you for taking me again. Appreciate it. Brice, I wanted to go back to your commentary just very quickly to make sure I have it on the segment growth for next quarter. I think you said that -- I thought these were year-over-year statements. Foundry and logic, you have leading-edge more than offsetting the ICAPS clients. It sounds like you think foundry-logic grows year-over-year. You said DRAM stable. So DRAM kind of flattish year-over-year? And then you said NAND growing, I guess, year-over-year. But within the full guide, would that not imply that NAND is down sequentially? Just can you sort of confirm that I have that commentary on the segments correct?
Brice Hill : Yes. Stacy, I think you've got all those right. And it was a year-over-year commentary that we were providing. So NAND has ticked up. Leading logic is definitely accelerating. I think we've shared that mature logic is down, but we expected that after the 2 years of rapid growth. And so to the extent that that's a little lower, it's being filled in by leading and just sort of continued strength on the DRAM. And what's happened in the DRAM business, depending on which quarter you are looking at. The first couple of quarters last year, we had the shipments to China customers. This year, that business is still very strong. And it's all that leading-edge -- those leading-edge customers that are making those investments. So I think you have those puts and takes correct.
Stacy Rasgon : Got it. Okay. So based -- I'd have DRAM down -- I guess, DRAM down sequentially, NAND could be up sequentially and then foundry and logic will be up pretty decent sequentially if I tie up those year-over-year statements?
Brice Hill : Yes, that's fair.
Stacy Rasgon : Okay, thank you appreciate it.
Brice Hill : Thank you.
Operator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Brice Hill for any further remarks.
Brice Hill : Thank you. In summary, we're pleased to be operating at record levels. We are well equipped to navigate the dynamic conditions in the economic environment, and we are investing in significant industry collaborations to accelerate innovation, all of which position us to grow our business over the coming years. Thank you. Liz, please close the call.
Liz Morali: Great. Thank you, Bryce, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I'd like to call your attention to 2 upcoming investor events. First, Gary will attend the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference on May 29. And then on June 4, Brice will be at the BofA Global Technology Conference. Lastly, a replay of today’s call will be available on the Investor Relations website by 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2025 Q1  (2025-02-13 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Afterwards, there will be a question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Liz Morali, Vice President of Investor Relations. Liz, you may begin.
Liz Morali: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for today's call. With me today are Gary Dickerson, President and CEO, and Brice Hill, CFO. Before we continue, let me remind you that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including predictions, estimates, projections, or other statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those mentioned in these forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filing with the SEC. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, we will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. I will now turn the call over to Gary.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Liz. In our first fiscal quarter of 2025, Applied Materials delivered record revenues surpassing the prior high we set last quarter. The major technology trends reshaping the global economy are made possible by advanced semiconductors, underpinning long-term secular growth for the industry and especially Applied Materials. We are providing our customers a unique and connected portfolio of solutions to accelerate the technology roadmap, positioning us for continued growth and outperformance in the years to come. In my prepared remarks, I'll share our latest market insight, I'll describe how our innovations are enabling the major device architecture inflections that are critical to advancing energy-efficient AI, and I'll talk about why high-velocity co-innovation is more important than ever as the industry races to bring next-generation technology to consumers faster and at lower cost. Starting with the market, AI remains central to our outlook. With almost infinite possible uses, AI is the most transformative technology change of our lifetimes and a major catalyst for innovation and growth across the technology sector. Early deployment of AI supported approximately 20% year-on-year growth of global semiconductor sales in 2024, and the market remains on track to exceed $1 trillion of annual revenues by 2030. We're only at the beginning of what's possible. And as we look ahead, we expect disruptive innovations to significantly improve the energy efficiency and cost of AI, opening up new applications and growing the overall market opportunity. To unlock this potential, innovation is required across the technology stack from the models and software, as we've seen in recent weeks with DeepSeq, to data center architecture, chip design, and how those chips are made. Advancements in foundational semiconductor technologies will have a dramatic impact on system-level energy and cost reduction in the AI data center. I've previously described four critical areas the industry is currently focusing on: leading-edge logic, high-performance DRAM, DRAM stacking referred to as high bandwidth memory or HBM, and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together in an integrated package. There's also a fifth theme emerging, as we are seeing major innovations in power electronics. These innovations can address data transfer energy consumption within the data center as well as significantly reduce grid-to-data center power losses. Applied has strong leadership in all these areas, and we're best positioned at future device architecture inflections including next-generation gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery, 4F squared, and 3D DRAM. Advanced packaging, compound semiconductors for power electronics, and silicon photonics. These device architecture inflections in logic, compute memory, packaging, and power devices grow the market for wafer fab equipment, increase the relative mix of materials engineering technologies, and provide opportunities for Applied to gain market share. Taking leading-edge foundry logic as an example, the transition from the most advanced generation of FinFET to the first nodes with integrated gate-all-around and backside power delivery grows our total available market by more than 15% to around $14 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. At the same time, we expect related Applied revenues to grow in the 30% range for the equivalent wafer fab capacity. While the bulk of spending for these inflections is ahead of us, we are already seeing a positive impact on our business. In 2024, we believe we outperformed the market in aggregate across leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, advanced packaging, and the ICAPS markets outside of China. The ability of US companies to serve the China market is constrained and has been further limited by updated trade rules announced in December and January. We estimate the incremental impact of these new rules will be around $400 million of revenue in fiscal 2025, approximately half of which is service revenue. We also see China being a smaller portion of global wafer fab equipment spending in 2025. At Applied Materials, our strategy is to develop and commercialize the most enabling technologies for the industry across leading-edge logic, memory, advanced packaging, and ICAPS. We have focused our investments on these high-growth inflections that allow us to create and capture more value. One of the ways we are implementing our strategy is to provide our customers unique and connected solutions that take advantage of our broad portfolio of technologies, capabilities, and partnerships. Our co-optimized and integrated solutions address higher-value device challenges for customers and are difficult for competitors to replicate. A good example is our integrated hybrid bonding interconnect solution that combines six technologies, including one module from a partner, into a single integrated system. In the past quarter, we successfully completed important qualification milestones and received volume orders from multiple leading-edge customers. Our integrated hybrid bonding system is one of our next-generation solutions that is allowing us to extend our leadership in advanced packaging. In 2024, our packaging business captured more than half of the market we serve, and we remain on track to double our revenues over the next several years. Another key pillar of our strategy is high-velocity co-innovation. We believe this is key for Applied and our customers to bring next-generation technology to market faster and at lower cost. By speeding up cycles of learning through tighter ecosystem collaborations, we are accelerating new chip architectures, driving higher mutual success rates, and optimizing R&D efficiencies. Among our accomplishments in the past quarter, we launched our EPYC advanced packaging strategy at a technical summit we hosted in Singapore that brought together R&D leaders representing more than 20 global companies. We were part of two teams that received CHIPS Act grants to develop advanced packaging substrates for 3D integration. We are leading the team for silicon substrates, and we have a long-term partnership and investment in the company that won the grant for glass core packaging. We made significant progress with the construction of the EPIC Center in Silicon Valley, which is on track to come online in 2026 and will become the centerpiece of our global EPIC collaboration platform. And we partnered with TPG to transition Applied Thin Film Battery business into an independent company. We're also evolving our collaborative model and services where we are helping customers manage increasing complexity in their business as they ramp next-generation technology into high-volume manufacturing. We are deploying our advanced service products, including our Actionable Insight Accelerator data platform or AIX, to help accelerate customers' R&D programs, reduce technology transfer times, and optimize device performance, yield, output, and cost in their fabs. Through these closer working relationships, a high percentage of our service revenues is generated from subscriptions in the form of multiyear agreements. While our near-term service growth is negatively impacted by trade restrictions, we remain confident that we will still grow AGS at a low double-digit annualized growth rate over the longer term. Before I hand over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. As major technology trends reshape the global economy in the semiconductor industry, Applied continues to deliver strong financial performance in the near term. We are best positioned at major device architecture inflections in fast-growing areas of the market that are critical to energy-efficient AI, and we are focused on high-velocity co-innovation with our customers and partners to bring breakthrough technology to market faster than ever before. Brice?
Brice Hill: Thanks, Gary. And thank you to everyone joining us for today's call. We had a strong start to the fiscal year, with healthy revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, which helped drive a 12% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. In addition, we distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders with $1.3 billion of share repurchases and $326 million of dividends. For fiscal Q1, our results were largely in line with our expectations with total net sales of approximately $7.2 billion, up 7% year over year with growth in both semiconductor systems and applied global services. Non-GAAP gross margin was 48.9%, up 100 basis points year over year and our highest quarterly gross margin since fiscal year 2000. The strong margin performance in Q1 was the result of a very favorable mix and increasing adoption of our leading-edge technologies and advanced integrated systems. In addition, we progressed on our value-based pricing initiatives and cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.31 billion with increased R&D investments to support our technology growth areas. Non-GAAP EPS was a record $2.38, up 12% year over year given the revenue growth, better profitability, and share repurchases. Moving to the segments, semiconductor system sales were $5.36 billion for Q1, up 9% year over year driven by 20% growth in foundry logic, partially offset by an expected decline in DRAM sales as prior year sales to customers in China did not repeat. Non-GAAP operating margin of 37.3% was up 160 basis points year over year. Sales for the ICAPS nodes, which serve customers across the IoT, communications, automotive, power, and sensor markets, were down slightly year over year, flat quarter over quarter. Moving to applied global services, AGS delivered revenue of $1.59 billion in Q1, up 8% year over year with healthy growth in services partially offset by a decline in sales of 200-millimeter equipment. Non-GAAP operating margin of 28% was down 30 basis points year over year. Lastly, our display business delivered revenue of $183 million. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion and debt of $6.3 billion. Cash from operations in the quarter was $925 million, capital expenditures were $381 million, and free cash flow was $544 million. We distributed $1.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $326 million in dividends. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $7.6 billion remains available under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our outlook, we are seeing strong momentum for leading-edge foundry logic where we are particularly well positioned as our customers ramp the most advanced technology nodes with gate-all-around transistors into high-volume manufacturing. Offsetting leading edge is a more measured level of investment in the ICAPS nodes following strong spending in 2023 and 2024. In DRAM, we are seeing healthy demand but face tough year-over-year comparisons given the purchases from Chinese customers in 2024 that do not repeat this year. We are also seeing growth in NAND, albeit from historically low levels. As Gary mentioned, as a result of the expanded export controls announced in December and January, we expect to face a headwind to revenue of approximately $400 million in fiscal 2025. Nearly half of that impact will be in Q2. The impacts in the second half of the fiscal year will be more weighted to AGS as we are no longer able to service certain customers, and following the step down in revenue in Q2, we would anticipate a return to growth in Q3 for AGS. Based on these trade restrictions and our view of our business, for Q2, we expect that China as a percentage of total revenue will be about five percentage points lower than in Q1. This is below the normalized level of approximately 30%. Taking all of these factors into account for fiscal Q2, we expect total revenue of $7.1 billion, plus or minus $400 million, which represents a 7% increase year over year, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.30, plus or minus $0.18, which represents a 10% increase year over year. We expect semiconductor systems revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, up 8% year over year, AGS revenue of approximately $1.55 billion, up 1% year over year, and display revenue of approximately $250 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.3 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of approximately 13%. In closing, our business is strong, and we remain confident in our growth opportunities across all of our business segments. We are making significant investments in R&D to grow our share at the leading edge, and we are increasing our capital investments to be the leader in high-velocity co-innovation with our customers. This is an important indicator of the confidence we have in the growth, and with our differentiated technology, unique insights, and deep industry relationships, we are poised to benefit from the technology transitions and semiconductor growth that is expected over the coming years. Liz, we're now ready to begin the Q&A.
Liz Morali: Thanks, Bryce. To help us reach as many people as we can on today's call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have an additional question, please re-queue, and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session.
Operator: And our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I know you guys aren't or haven't been giving specific WFE numbers, but at a high level, Gary and or Bryce, I was hoping you could provide a little bit of context on how you're thinking about the year. I know you gave a couple of comments, but by application, by geography, you know, how is 2025 likely to shape up in your view and more importantly, your outperformance vis-a-vis the market, you know, where key drivers that we should be focused on and if you could speak to the magnitude of outperformance relative to what you achieved in 2024, that would be really helpful. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Toshiya. Nice to hear from you. So first, we'd say that, you know, our Q2 guide gives a really good indication. So leading edge with all the strength that you see in AI and, you know, pulling DRAM, advanced logic, and HBM. That factors into what we see in the market today. So leading edge is growing. We've been thinking it will be accelerating through the course of the year, and we do see that growing strongly in Q2. And we highlighted that we've also been watching the ICAP market after the significant build-out the last couple of years in China. And that is lower in Q2. So those things offset consistent year-over-year growth in the overall market. So that's the big change from a market perspective. If you look at the memory side, our memory is roughly flat quarter over quarter. We do see some additions on the NAND side, and that's offset by a slight reduction in DRAM. NAND's growing, but, of course, that's from a smaller level. The last thing I would share is when you think about advanced packaging, we had a significant amount of capacity adds last year in the HBM side for the initial burst of capacity. And we're still, you know, selling into HBM, still adding equipment into that market, but it's at a slower rate. So that's part of the outlook also. So the key thing there is we've all been waiting to see if Advanced Logic would ramp strongly enough to offset any slower rate of investment in ICAPS, and that is what we're seeing in Q2, and that's, you know, our best what we try to do is share what we're seeing today, and we think that's our best indication on how you can think about the year at this point.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Toshiya, relative to the outperformance questions. Over the last four years, including last year, we outperformed in aggregate across leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, high bandwidth memory, advanced packaging, and ICAPS markets outside of China. And we've been talking about this a lot. We're focused on major device architecture inflections critical to AI energy-efficient computing. When we're meeting with all of our customers, that's where they're all focused. So, you know, for us, we're on track to capture greater than 50% share of our served market in gate-all-around and backside power and foundry logic. We gained 10 points of DRAM share, and we're positioned to gain share as 4F squared and 3D DRAM architectures are adopted. Packaging was around $1.7 billion in 2024, up 3x in four years. And as we've said many times, we're positioned to double this business in the coming years. In ICAPS, we gained several points of share since we formed the group six years ago. We brought several new products to market. We have a strong pipeline of new products that will grow our available market and position us well in this segment. And materials engineering intensity, where Applied has clear leadership, is increasing in next-generation chip architectures. So, you know, going forward, I like how we're positioned to win these major inflections. Again, we've been outperforming in all of these segments over the last four years, and we're well-positioned to continue to outperform going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question, please.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Bryce, I appreciate the color on the April quarter. The still consistent down a little bit explained by the China impact. And you're talking about the return to growth in AGS. Can you also comment on the silicon systems? Do they return to sequential growth in the July quarter, or will we have to wait and see?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Thanks, Atif. I think we'll have to wait and see on the semiconductor systems, but what we're sharing is we've been expecting the leading edge to accelerate. When you think about the gate-all-around and backside power nodes in the market and the advantages of those nodes for leading-edge architectures, we expect a significant amount of capacity to be put in place in those nodes, and that is what you see in Q2. And we expect that, you know, that is a good indication of where the market will be going. And then on the offset for that, we highlighted the ICAPS, and we've been watching that, but I'll just say that market. Our forecast for ICAPS and for ICAPS China seems to change every single quarter. And so we'll see how that evolves through the rest of the year. And then on the services business, yes, this will be similar to 2022 when there were new trade rules. We'll have a step back, as you can see in our guide in Q2, but we expect to grow from there at the low double-digit rate as we continue to add new types of services, and the new customers and new locations will make it more likely that the services business is utilized by the customers.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You said that the China impact in the second half will be weighted to AGS, but you also said AGS returns to growth in Q3. So, like, how do I square that circle on what's offsetting the China impact in the second half? And just, like, broadly, if I were to add the $200 million-ish or so that AGS is getting hit by the China sanctions, if you added that $200 million back in, would it still grow double digits this year?
Brice Hill: Yes. That's a good question. Thank you, Stacy, for the question. So on the AGS side, the way to think about it is approximately half of the impact will be taken in Q2, and then it'll be a continued impact in the following quarters. But we don't expect it to be a sequential reconciling line item. In other words, whatever business we can't support in Q2, that's the same business or less in Q3 and Q4. So there is an impact in Q3 and Q4, but we think you shouldn't worry about it from a modeling perspective. We'll just begin to add from there, and we'll grow at the rate that we've described, you know, low double digits as we continue to add installed base and tools to support. And then, didn't do the calculation. I guess what I would say is from a core AGS perspective, if you take the 200-millimeter out, we're absolutely growing at low double digits or higher.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
CJ Muse: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could speak a bit to gross margins. You talked about base pricing starting to come in in the January quarter. Would love to hear more about, you know, how you see that going through the model throughout all of calendar 2025. And I guess as part of that, how should we be thinking about kind of evolving mix in terms of modeling gross margin either first half, second half, or kind of exit rate for calendar 2025 would be very helpful.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thank you, CJ. Good to hear from you. So on the gross margin, 48.9% and 48.4% in our guide in Q2, very strong mix. In both quarters, obviously, with the China impacts for Q2, it's a little bit lesser mix strength. We're still going to reiterate our 48% underlying rate. So we think, you know, when we don't have those quarters with ultra-strong mix, that's still about the ballpark for our normalized rate. So think in the second half that unless we maintain the exact same mix, which we likely don't expect, we will be closer to that 48% gross margin for the year or not for the year. Sorry. We're not giving a guide for the year, but that is our underlying baseline rate to think of as you think about where the business is normally. And then if you think about the pricing, you know, there I think of two dynamics with pricing. One, the solutions that we're developing that Gary has pointed the company toward, those are increasingly valuable solutions for the customers. And so there's an increasing value proposition for the equipment itself. Then our pricing mechanism is to make sure that we're including that in our thinking with respect to the pricing, and we also have a disciplined infrastructure to have those discussions with customers. So as we allocate our R&D, we're, of course, allocating to the areas that we think are most valuable in the market. And we think, you know, it's a matter of execution to achieve that value in the marketplace, which is what we're trying to do. So I said third inning last quarter on the process for pricing, and I think that's still accurate.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a longer-term conceptual question for Gary related to LIDHO versus HNEP intensity. You know, if let's say overall WFE intensity stays around mid-teens, it means WFE will grow in line with semiconductor industry sales over the next several years. And if that happens, do you think, Gary, LIDHO takes more share, or do you think edge or depth take more share and hence grow faster or slower than overall semiconductor industry sales? I've heard arguments on both sides, but would appreciate your thoughts.
Gary Dickerson: Oh, hi, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So if I look at the major inflections that we're focused on, leading-edge foundry logic, gate-all-around, and backside power, you know, our customers have talked about being able to achieve and backside power 30% area scaling benefit, but beyond power and performance benefits, with really no change in feature size. So, you know, that's basically what we're seeing in foundry logic. And we think that continues going forward. In DRAM, if you look at what our customers have talked about in 4F squared, they also talk about significant area savings as they implement that new architecture. And, of course, again, for all of these things, we're incredibly well-positioned. And then we get to 3D DRAM. 3D DRAM is more similar, not the same materials, but a similar impact where the relative spending for materials engineering goes up significantly versus lithography. And then, of course, another area that we're focused on and the entire industry is focused on is advanced packaging. And, you know, when we look at what the AI servers look like three or four years from now, the architectures are going to be very different. And the way the data is connected in those architectures, there's just going to be tremendous innovation again around materials innovation. So when I look across any of these different markets, and, of course, ICAPS is really all driven through materials innovation, we've talked about this before in our master classes. We see the percentage of materials engineering relative spending to be increasing going forward around all of these different architecture inflections.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Bryce, do you think as you look at, you know, I know that you're not gonna give us a WFE number for last year, but do you think you gained WFE share? That's the first question. And then how do you kind of assess, Gary, headwind from these, you know, from these, you know, incumbent companies in China because I know that they have delayed rev rec, so it makes it hard to sort of, you know, measure year to year. But they're about 5% now of WFE. It's up, like, 400 basis points over the past four to five years, and that's all definition. You know, you've done a, you know, great job, you know, holding share and gaining share. But how do you sort of think about that headwind from China? Because so much of the income model spending is from there. Thanks.
Brice Hill: Okay, Tim. Nice to hear from you. Thank you. On the share in 2024, of course, we don't know yet in terms of the final measures there, but you heard in Gary's script, he talked about, we think we've gained share in all the markets except for, likely China. So we'll just have to see what the, you know, what that reading is once all the share numbers are in. So we feel well-positioned from that perspective. And even in China, we feel good about the way we compete. It's just, yes, the local Chinese vendors have some advantages with the trade rules that have been put in place. And then on the headwinds for China, I think, you know, we do have lower visibility, but we continue to add customers. And, you know, we think that's a huge market. It's our largest ICAPS market, and ICAPS is the largest market for Applied. We expect that to grow over time, you know, at the device level, mid to high single digits, as you know. The equipment investments in the last couple of years have been ahead of the market, so we've expected it to moderate for some period of time. So we'll see how that plays out. But for us, that continues to be one of the most important markets for the company.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Tim, just so I would add, and again, I talked about this a little bit earlier. Leading-edge foundry logic, we're incredibly well-positioned for those inflections. DRAM, we've gained 10 points of share. And again, really well-positioned for 4F squared and 3D DRAM. Bandwidth memory, you know, that's another one where we have a very strong leading position. And advanced packaging is another area where it's up 3x in four years, and we anticipate that we'll double that business. And then that'll keep going into the future. And again, we're just really well-positioned for all those inflections. In ICAPS, we have room to grow in PDC and H, and we have momentum in those segments. And I talked earlier about the pipeline of ICAPS innovations. Again, we formed this group six years ago. We brought 20 new products to market, and we have new products in the pipeline that will expand our total available market. We have new products for cost-competitive applications, and we have innovations to enable new ICAPS device architectures that we're co-innovating with leading customers. So as Bryce said, in the areas where we can compete, I feel really good about our positions and our pipeline going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
Harlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, we track many of your end customers in the semiconductor industry, both fabulous and IDMs, and two nanometers. Design starts appear to be we're tracking their design starts, especially at accelerating since the second half of last year, especially in areas like AI, accelerated compute, mobile. Is the team in talking with your customers, is the team getting a sense on how big the upcoming two-nanometer node transition and more importantly, volume production potential could be relative to three nanometer?
Brice Hill: Hi, Harlan. Gary might also add on to this. You know, I've seen various estimates for two nanometers based on the performance benefits of two nanometers. I think we're expecting that to be a large node. If you look at some of the third-party estimates, you know, that should be a good landing spot for designs just like seven nanometers in the past was a good landing spot for designs. So we're expecting it to be, you know, on the large side from a node perspective.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Harlan, I would just add that, you know, everybody's focused on energy-efficient computing for AI, and if you look at what our customers are saying, they're very bullish about the size of that two-nanometer node.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, I had a question on gate-all-around. You've spoken about getting over 50% share of the incremental TAM there. It seems like the Epi stack is one of the more critical ones, and your Epi taxi competitor seems to be making some strides. I'm just kinda curious. Can you talk a little bit about your IP market share and if you still feel confident in the 50% share gain of the overall gate-all-around opportunity? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. I mentioned earlier, we're in deep partnerships with all of our customers focused around this concept of high-velocity co-innovation. And, you know, we're working with every one of our customers out a decade into the future on multiple technology nodes. For gate-all-around, we still are on track to do what we had talked about earlier with gaining more than 50% of the incremental spending for gate-all-around, and Epi is part of that. We're in a very strong position. I think 85% of those Epi steps are selective Epi where we have tremendous strength. We have new innovations we're bringing to market in Epi, and so we still feel very confident in our outperformance going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. My question is on China. I think, Bryce, you said for Q2 outlook, you use the word, you know, China will be below normal in terms of percentage exposure. I would think that the export restrictions, those are permanent. I'm just curious as to when you say below normal, are you expecting China to recover to, like, 30% level that you previously communicated? And then when do you think we might get to that level? And then maybe for Gary. Gary, you know, for over the last 90 days, excluding the export restrictions, can you talk to, you know, how the demand conditions are within China?
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Srini. So first of all, 30%, we still think will be a good long-term rate for us or a good long-term estimate of the share to China. You know, when you think about the market, of course, for us now, that's an ICAPS market. We can't serve the leading edge. That will be a growing market over time. The devices will grow mid to high single digits, if not more, heading to, you know, the one helping to get to the $1.3 trillion semiconductor market by 2030. So that market will continue to grow. We may pause a little bit less. We may have a little bit lower rate of investment as we go, you know, through the next short period of time, will that adjust? But that's a very strong market for us. So 26% in Q2 and 30% is a good estimate for the company, and, of course, that includes all of our businesses, AGS, and display also. And then, Gary, on what we're seeing with respect to demand.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. I think I'll just make a comment on that. It's still our largest market. So you see leading edge accelerating, but ICAPS is still our largest market, and China is, you know, the largest country inside that market. And so when you're thinking about it and you're thinking about what we're describing as a step back in the rate of investment, you should still think about it as just, you know, a very large opportunity and growth opportunity going forward. And so we think the rate slows down a little bit after two huge years of investment. But we expect that market to grow over time. We've continued to add customers. We're tracking a large number of projects that are underway. We expect capacity to be added every single year, and, you know, that forms the backbone of our expectations.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. The one thing I would add is that, you know, we believe that the ICAPS market over the longer term will grow kinda mid to high single digits. And as I mentioned earlier, we have new products in the pipeline that expand our total available market, new products for cost-competitive segments, and opportunities to grow in large segments where we have momentum. So I think, you know, longer term, we're positive on the market and positive on our position in the market.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.
Brian Chin: Hi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions or maybe one question. Maybe for Bryce, I think you previously disclosed that $549 million reduction in backlog for the fiscal year in a filing. You're quantifying a $400 million impact for the year. Did you revise what that actual impact would be, or is there some maybe a residual amount of $149 million that sits outside of the 12-month horizon?
Brice Hill: You've got it exactly right, Brian. So it's not much of a change. That $549 million was our backlog, and it covered, you know, more than just the year. And so we shared, I think, what was in the 12 months, and if you did that math, I think it was about $380 million. So we're still very close in terms of what we're thinking the impact is for the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Joe Quatrochi: Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for DRAM growth. If we were to exclude just the benefit of China DRAM spending in the comparison a year ago, how should we think about the growth in your business this year?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Thanks, Joe. I'll start on this one. I think we've seen, you know, two record years of DRAM. And, of course, 2024 was buoyed by the extra China demand that we saw in, you know, I can't call the year here, but we see the rate of investment in DRAM continuing in the rest of the world. So there's a lot of pull, you know, for the HBM solution, and there's a lot of pull in for DRAM in the advanced, you know, compute performance systems. So I would expect continued momentum in DRAM, and that's included in our outlook in Q2.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Joe, I would just say that I mentioned earlier, we're more bullish on compute memory than we are in storage memory. And then what our customers have said is it takes three times the number of wafers to produce the same number of bits for HBM. So that's gonna certainly help the growth rate over the longer term.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham and Company. Your question, please.
Charles Shi: Hi. Yes. Good afternoon. I have a question about the expected revenue from gate-all-around nodes. You previously said more than $2.5 billion in fiscal, I mean, in probably calendar 2024, and they expect to double that number? And has the 2025 number moved up or down or any changes? Maybe the other part of the question, I think, that you previously said, last year's gate-all-around revenue plus this year is kinda implies a 100k global capacity built on two nanometers by the end of this year. Do you see potentially that that gate-all-around spending could actually accelerate further into 2026? Because we were trying to think about what the end capacity could be in 2026, but do you wanna get your early thoughts on 2026 if possible? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay, Charles. Thanks for the question. So first thing, yes, we have not changed our expectations for growth looking into 2025 with the gate-all-around related equipment. So $2.5 billion in 2024 and then the opportunity to double that in 2025. And if you put those together, you know, that's just over $7 billion. And when we describe the SAM for us with gate-all-around and backside power, yeah, you can back in and say that implies that there's approximately 100,000 wafer starts of, you know, pilot in HBM or HVM, excuse me, high-volume manufacturing capacity being put in place in the beginning. And then, of course, you know, you'll have to do your own research to see what size you think the node would be. I would just suggest that nodes are generally larger than that. So we would expect that to continue and the ramp to continue beyond 2025 for sure.
Gary Dickerson: I would say the one thing incrementally is that as you go forward, you're going to add in backside power. That also is growing our available market, and we have a very strong share there. So once you have gate-all-around and backside power together, our opportunity grows significantly.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess the question is regarding sort of where your level of confidence is in your customer forecast right now. And I know you haven't given us guidance for the full year obviously, but I know the customers have generally given you pretty good visibility on the forecast. Maybe you could talk about the different segments, and you sound, you know, pretty constructive with regard to foundry logic spending for the year. Your comments suggested that ICAP, the forecasts have been changing a lot, so I'd imagine that there's some uncertainty there. Perhaps you could speak in those terms for the different segments.
Brice Hill: Sure. Thanks for the question, Chris. So I think, you know, I would put the level of confidence for larger customers is fairly high. So especially since COVID and, you know, the inflation events that we saw, we've asked for longer perspectives from all of our customers. So we have more visibility with the larger customers. So if you think about leading logic, more visibility, certainly for DRAM, certainly for NAND. And then I would split up ICAPS. It would be the same sort of observation for the more mature, longer-standing companies in the ICAPS space. Good visibility, same practices. And then just much less experience there on both sides. And the visibility gets lower, and that's where we've seen a lot of volatility in our forecast. I think in the past couple of years, we've continually increased our China forecast as we've gone through the year. And so you just have less visibility, and the plans change as that goes forward. And then just a last comment, you know, thinking about foundry logic, because there's lots of questions about the various foundries. Our perspective there is, not only do we have the market expectations, and so, you know, we think we're pretty comfortable with our forecast for leading logic being driven by, you know, data center, PC, smartphone, and understanding what the end demand is for those markets. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And as a reminder, if you have a question at this time, our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question, please.
Vijay Rakesh: Yeah. Hi. Just a question on the packaging side. I know packaging is gonna be one of the more important and on the memory side. I'm just wondering if there's a way to look at what the mix of, you know, just packaging was of total WFE. If we were to look at 2025 and how you see that mix of WFE growing as packaging becomes a bigger and bigger chunk of both memory and logic. Thanks.
Brice Hill: I'll try, Vijay. We said last year that in 2024 that our packaging-related revenues in advanced packaging were $1.7 billion. And so, you know, that we have an advantage share in that space. So you probably have to do some backward math to imply what packaging is. And it's growing at a strong rate. I think just thinking about the, you know, what's behind that, we all know that there's, Gary calls it a race for performance on these leading-edge systems. Getting the highest utilization out of GPUs, CPUs, accelerators, etcetera. And that's really what's driving the increased demand for these packaging technologies. So we expect that to grow significantly over the coming years.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Vijay, we also talked about doubling again our packaging revenue over the next few years. There's just tremendous innovation happening in this space. We talked about CHIPS grants on new substrate technologies for silicon and glass. How you connect the AI server and that architecture in three or four years is gonna be very different than what it looks like today. So, you know, I believe this is a great opportunity for Applied where the leader in wiring on the front of the wafer, back of the wafer, and in advanced packaging. And this segment is going to see a significant compound annual growth rate because it's so important for energy-efficient computing.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your question, please.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. One question, two parts. Based on the last, okay, the SSG backlog of $8.3 billion down 23% year over year. And then AGS backlog of $6.8 billion up 32%. When do you expect backlog for SSG to show the inflection point and show growth? And on the AGS, the $200 million that is gonna come out because of the restriction in China, that seems a very small part of the AGS backlog. Is that a reflection of, yeah, the AGS backlog is the multi-year or any color you can add here would be great.
Brice Hill: Yes, Mehdi. Thanks for the question. You've got it right on the AGS. We've got multi-year contracts in AGS that tend to make that backlog look, you know, larger and your book-to-bill look much larger when we sign those contracts. So the average contract life, I think, is in the 2.9-year region, and we're signing some that are longer than that. So that really is what distorts the, you know, the backlog or makes it larger for AGS. And then on the equipment side, you know, since the supply chain and COVID, on the equipment side. So we stopped reporting that on a quarterly basis because it's not a very good indication of our, you know, the underlying business changes. We're working to get longer visibility with our customers, and we're working to get longer commits on the builds. And so there's a lot of movement in that. So I wouldn't have anything to share other than what you've seen in our 10-K.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Schultz Milander from Redburn Atlantic. Your question, please.
Tim Schultz Milander: Yeah. Hi there. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe one for Gary and one for Bryce, please. Gary, you mentioned advanced packaging and you referenced volume orders from multiple leading-edge customers. Maybe could you share a little bit of color in terms of what kind of device applications they are and when you'd expect volume manufacturing to begin? And then, Bryce, just a modeling question. On that tax asset revaluation. Could you maybe just provide a little more color on that? And is there any read across or implication for the remaining $2.4 billion of deferred tax assets on the balance sheet? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Tim, relative to packaging revenue, it's really coming from all of the different packaging architectures. We have a very strong position, broad, unique connected portfolio. So, you know, I wouldn't say that again, for us, including in HBM or we were at $700 million in revenue this last year. We have strength across all of those different architecture types. I don't really wanna comment. I'll let customers comment on, you know, which architecture is ramping. I would say, as I mentioned earlier, there's going to be tremendous innovation in this space with very different architectures than what are in the market today. This is gonna be very important for energy-efficient computing. Applied has been investing to be positioned to win those architecture inflections.
Brice Hill: Okay. And then, Tim, thanks for the tax question. So, yeah, good to point out that on our GAAP net income, you'll see a significant difference. And what is happening there, it's one of those situations where good news is bad news. So we've just renewed our incentive rates in Singapore, and so the tax asset that we have in Singapore that, you know, was created years and years ago when we moved assets to Singapore, that is essentially less valuable because it will protect from lower taxes, if that makes sense. So our tax rate goes down, which is good news. And then the asset that you have to protect from taxes is a little bit less valuable than what it was with higher tax rates. And so that $674 million, I think that number is a revaluation of that tax asset. And I wouldn't look, you know, we're amortizing the benefits of that tax move of years to go. That's always in our reconciliation, but this particular event that we're talking about, I don't think there's any look forward on that.
Operator: Thank you. And as a reminder, if you do have a question, please press star one one on your phone. And this does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Bryce for any further remarks.
Brice Hill: Thank you. To recap, we believe we're well-positioned for leading-edge technology inflections, together with our efforts to accelerate industry collaboration, set us up to benefit from the semiconductor growth as expected over the coming years. Thank you for attending today. And, Liz, please close the call.
Liz Morali: Thank you, Bryce. And thank you to everyone for joining the call today. A replay of today's call will be available on the Investor Relations website by 5 PM Pacific time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's call. Conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-11-14 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During the prepared remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Liz Morali, Vice President of Investor Relations. Liz, you may begin.
Liz Morali: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for today's call. With me today are Gary Dickerson, President and CEO; and Brice Hill, CFO. Before we continue, let me remind you that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including predictions, estimates, projections, or other statements about future events. Actual results may differ materially from those mentioned in these forward-looking statements, as a result of risks and uncertainties. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, we will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our Investor Relations website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. I will now turn the call over to Gary.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Liz. With record revenue and earnings in our fourth quarter, Applied Materials delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2024 and our fifth consecutive year of growth. I would like to recognize the hard work and commitment of our global team for delivering these outstanding results. As this is our year-end call, I'll begin by highlighting our key accomplishments over the past 12 months. A year ago, in our November 2023 call, I said the company's priorities for 2024 were driving R&D programs to further differentiate our unique and connected portfolio to extend our leadership at key inflections that enable future industry growth, making operational and supply chain improvements to better serve customers, and drive productivity across the enterprise, and, ensuring that we scale the company in ways that are sustainable and environmentally responsible. Over the past year, we made significant progress in all these areas. We strengthened our position at major inflections in logic, DRAM and advanced packaging. We delivered double-digit growth in our parts and services business. We made improvements to our operations and supply chain that supported strong cash flow and margin performance. And, our key strategic initiatives are on track including the build out of our EPIC collaborative R&D platform and the deployment of our Net Zero Playbook. In my prepared remarks today, I'll talk about three key topics. First, how large-scale, secular trends are driving growth and innovation in semiconductors, and why energy-efficient computing is emerging as a unifying driving force for the industry. Second, how the major device architecture inflections that make up the semiconductor industry's roadmap are increasingly enabled by innovations in Materials Science and Materials Engineering, where Applied has clear leadership. And third, as the industry roadmap becomes increasingly complex, how we are creating incremental growth opportunities for the company to offer new solutions with our unique and connected portfolio, our high-velocity collaborative R&D platform, and our advanced service products. In the coming years, we are going to experience the biggest technology changes of our lifetimes with major advances in automation and robotics, electric and autonomous transportation, clean energy, and artificial intelligence. All of these tectonic shifts are made possible by semiconductors, and this provides a catalyst for the semiconductor industry to create and capture more value than ever before. The biggest tectonic shift is AI, which has virtually endless applications and therefore the potential to transform almost every area of the economy. Deploying AI at large scale will require AI-computing to be significantly more energy-efficient than it is today. To realize the full potential of AI, the leading AI companies are talking about the need to drive a 10,000 times improvement in computing-performance-per-watt over the next 15 years. To deliver energy-efficiency improvements of this magnitude, evolutionary innovation will be insufficient. Instead, we see a new technology roadmap emerging made up of multiple device architecture inflections in logic, memory and advanced packaging. This creates three significant opportunities for Applied to deliver more value to customers and extend our differentiation in the market. First, we have built a broad, unique and connected portfolio of highly enabling technologies that we can supply to customers as co-optimized and integrated solutions. By combining adjacent process steps such as material deposition, etch, and material modification into an integrated system, we are providing chipmakers innovative and comprehensive solutions to enable their energy-efficient architecture inflections. Integrated solutions account for around 30% of our Semiconductor Systems revenue, and we expect them to become an even larger part of our portfolio in the future. Second, we are driving earlier and broader collaborations with our customers and partners to bring next-generation technology to market faster. Our global EPIC platform, that we will build out over the next several years, is specifically designed to accelerate cycles of learning, increase mutual success rates, and improve investment efficiencies. In the U.S., construction of the EPIC Center in Silicon Valley is well underway and on-track to come online in 2026, and we will share more details about our EPIC Advanced Packaging strategy at a technical summit we are hosting for R&D leaders next week in Singapore. And our third key opportunity is in services, where we are focused on helping customers manage increasing complexity in their business as the industry scales. We are deploying our advanced service products to help them accelerate their R&D, speed up transfer of new chip technologies from lab to fab, and then optimize device performance, yield, output, and cost in high-volume manufacturing. This is supporting double-digit growth in our parts and service business, with a high percentage of these revenues coming from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. These subscriptions have a high renewal rate, and the average tenure of the agreements is growing. This year, we signed our first five-year service agreements with multiple customers. Overall, AGS delivered a record quarter, a record year, and their 21st consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Across the business, we are translating opportunities into results as major device architecture inflections grow our available market and we gain share through the technology transitions. In 2024, the leading-edge logic companies started moving the first gate-all-around nodes from their R&D pilot lines into high-volume production. We generated more than $2.5 billion of revenue from these advanced nodes in the fiscal year and expect those revenues to approximately double in 2025. Overall, the transition from a FinFET-based node to a node with gate-all-around transistors and backside power distribution grows Applied's available market from around $12 billion to approximately $14 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. We also expect to capture more than 50% of the process equipment spending for the gate-all-around nodes, up from the mid-to-high 40% range for FinFET generation fabs. In DRAM, our revenues also grew significantly in fiscal 2024, up more than 60% year-on year. Compute memory is a critical technology for AI datacenters, and DRAM makers are accelerating their capacity plans especially in high-bandwidth memory, where high-performance DRAM dies are stacked and connected to a logic die with advanced packaging. The dies used in high-bandwidth memory are much larger than standard DRAM, which means that more than 3 times the wafer capacity is needed to produce the same volume of chips. On top of this, the packaging steps needed for die-stacking further increase our available market. In fiscal 2024, our HBM packaging revenues grew to more than $700 million. DRAM is a great example of how our inflection-focused innovation strategy is succeeding. By focusing on the most-enabling steps for next-generation technologies, Applied has increased our share of the DRAM market by around 10 points over the past decade. Future DRAM inflections will further expand our available market as next-generation 4F-squared and 3D DRAM architectures are even more materials engineering intensive. Advanced packaging is another major device architecture inflection that provides significant improvements in the performance, energy consumption, and cost of next-generation chips. We have been investing in new technology to enable advanced packaging for more than a decade, establishing strong leadership positions in micro-bump and through-silicon via. In fiscal 2024, our overall advanced packaging product portfolio generated close to $1.7 billion of revenue, up 3 times in the last four years. We believe this business will double in size in coming years, as heterogeneous integration is more widely adopted and we introduce new solutions that grow our addressable market. Gate-all-around transistors, backside power distribution, 4F-squared and 3D-DRAM, advanced packaging and next-generation power semiconductors are all examples of device architecture inflections that are enabled by materials engineering. As a result, materials engineering, which spans all the technologies needed to deposit materials, remove or shape materials, and modify the properties of materials at an atomic level, is growing as a percentage of overall equipment spending at advanced nodes. Before I hand over to Brice, let me summarize. In fiscal 2024, Applied grew revenue and earnings for the fifth consecutive year, we strengthened our position at the key technology inflections that customers will ramp in volume production over the next several years, we delivered double-digit growth in parts and services, and we drove operational performance improvements across Applied and our supply chain. As we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, we see AI and energy-efficient computing remaining the key driver of innovation in the semiconductor industry, and the industry's roadmap becoming increasingly dependent on materials engineering which grows Applied's addressable market and provides a tailwind for us to outperform through the investment cycle. I strongly believe that Applied Materials has the right capabilities, strategy, and partnerships, at the right time, and this puts us in a great position for the future. We are delivering differentiated solutions to our customers to help them win the key device architecture inflection races, we are strengthening R&D collaboration with customers and partners to drive innovation and commercialization velocity and optimize mutual success rates, and we are growing our service business by helping customers manage increasing complexity as the industry scales. Now, I'll hand over to Brice.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Gary, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. We had a strong fiscal 2024, delivering record revenue and earnings per share, generating healthy operating cash flow, and distributing over $5 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. I would like to thank the entire Applied Materials team for their hard work and execution, which enabled us to achieve these excellent results. For the full fiscal year, net sales were $27.2 billion, up 2.5% on a year-over-year basis with growth in all three business segments. Non-GAAP gross margin was 47.6%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and our highest annual gross margin rate since fiscal 2000, as we optimized our operations and made progress on value-based pricing. On a year-over-year basis, non-GAAP operating profit grew 2.7% and non-GAAP operating margin was up 10 basis points. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 7.5% year-over-year to $8.65. For fiscal Q4, net sales were $7.05 billion, up nearly 5% on a year-over-year basis, driven by solid growth in Semiconductor Systems and Services. China declined to 30% of revenue, in line with our previously communicated expectation and our historical average. Non-GAAP gross margin was 47.5%, up slightly on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis, driven by a favorable mix and operational improvements offsetting headwinds related to the lower China revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.28 billion, or 18.2% of revenue, and roughly in line with our expectations as we prioritized funding long-term strategic programs. Non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $2.32, up 9% year-over-year, and benefiting from higher gross margin, higher interest income, a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases. Turning to the segments, Semiconductor Systems sales were $5.18 billion for Q4, up 6% year-over-year, driven by leading-edge foundry-logic demand. Non-GAAP operating margin was 35.4%, down 50 basis points year-over-year given the normalizing China mix. DRAM sales declined 10% year-over-year, given the elevated purchases from China in Q4 of fiscal 2023. NAND sales were flat year-over-year. Foundry-logic sales increased 12% year-over-year, fueled by robust growth at the leading-edge, including increasing investments for gate-all-around nodes, as customers invested to enable critical technology inflections. Sales for the ICAPS nodes, which serve customers across the IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensor markets, were down year-over-year, given high demand in the year-ago period. Moving to Applied Global Services, AGS delivered record revenue of $1.64 billion in Q4, up 11% on a year-over-year basis and driven by robust growth in services, partially offset by a decline in 200-millimeter equipment sales. Non-GAAP operating margin of 30% was up 2.7 percentage points year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating income was a record $492 million. Year-over-year, we saw increases across many operational metrics, including a 7% increase in the installed base and a 10% increase in tools under service agreements. Our average contract length increased to 2.9 years, and we maintained a renewal rate of greater than 90%. Lastly, our Display business generated revenue of $211 million, in line with our expectations, as the industry experienced lower investment levels amidst ongoing weakness in end market demand. Over time, we expect there to be an increase in capital investments to support the adoption of OLED technology in IT devices like notebooks, PCs, and tablets. We are well-positioned to enable customers for the coming OLED IT inflection with our technology. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $8 billion and debt of $6.3 billion. Cash from operations in the quarter was $2.6 billion, capital expenditures were $407 million and free cash flow was $2.2 billion. In total, we generated $8.7 billion in operating cash flow and $7.5 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2024. We distributed $1.8 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $329 million in dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. For the full year, we distributed $5 billion to shareholders, of which $3.8 billion was through share repurchases, up 75% from $2.2 billion in fiscal 2023. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $8.9 billion remains available under our share repurchase authorization. As we contemplate fiscal Q1, we are seeing strong demand in leading-edge logic and the ICAPS nodes, and sequential growth in memory. With that in mind, let me share our outlook for fiscal Q1. We expect total revenue of $7.15 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.29, plus or minus $0.18, both representing an increase of approximately 7% on a year-over-year basis. We expect Semiconductor Systems revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, which is up 8% year-over-year, AGS revenue of approximately $1.65 billion, which is up 12% year-over-year, and Display revenue of approximately $175 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 48.4%, driven by a favorable mix, and cost and pricing improvements, and non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $1.33 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of approximately 14%. And our outlook is consistent with trade rules currently in effect. In closing, we had a strong fiscal 2024, with momentum across the majority of our markets, fueling record revenue and earnings per share. Our portfolio positions us to uniquely capitalize on the secular megatrends shaping the technology landscape from datacenter and AI to edge computing, the Internet of Things and display. Underpinning this is our strong investment-grade balance sheet, solid cash generation and healthy shareholder distributions. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session please.
Operator: Thank you. We will now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to ask what you're seeing or expecting for China mix as we go through next year. And I guess to that end, I was a little surprised you suggested, you saw ICAPS strength going into Q1. Do you think -- I guess maybe you can talk to us about how that ICAPS strength in the near term splits out between China and rest of the world, and how you see China mix either sustaining at 30% or moving off that number as we go through next year?
Brice Hill: Great. Thanks for the question Stacy, and hello. Yeah, the China mix, a couple of signals there. So, 30% in Q4 as we reported, and that's normalized and come down after we serve that China DRAM demand that we had in earlier quarters. Our outlook in Q1 is -- also contains approximately 30% for the China mix. When we think about ICAPS across the world, it is still very healthy. So, we said it's lower than our prior Q4. So, Q4 of '24 was a little bit lower than Q4 of '23, but the ICAPS market is still very healthy and it's healthy globally. It's healthy in China and it's healthy across the world from a total level perspective. Having said that, we expect the ICAPS markets to grow over time. We've talked about mid- to high-single-digits at the device level. We expect customers to continue to add capacity. There are signs to watch for. There are slower end markets in ICAPS, automotive, industrial, analog, image sensors are all markets that have been slower. So, we've kind of been looking to see if the investment rate would go a little bit lower, but as far as our Q4 and our Q1, it remains strong.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thanks. And for my follow-up then, if China mix isn't going up, gross margins are, so it doesn't sound like the gross margin increase is due to an increase in China mix. So, can you talk about the drivers of that gross margin increase into Q1? And I guess maybe talk to sustainability as we go through next year? Do you think you get back closer to the target ranges for gross margins as we go through the end of the year?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Thanks for the question on that. So, our gross margin, the way we want to shape that from your modeling perspective and where the business is, we think our underlying rate has improved to about 48.0% at this point. So, it has improved and that's -- we've made improvements top to bottom in the business, logistics, our inventory management, scrap management, cost overall and our implementation of value pricing. So, a lot of elements working on the gross margin equation. In Q1, in particular, it's -- we're guiding 48.4%, so above that 48.0% sort of baseline, and that's based on really strong product mix that we have in Q1. So, we think 48% is the right level for you to think about longer term and we'll of course continue to work on improving that.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, Stacy, this is Gary. One of the things also that we're very focused on is winning the inflections. There's a lot of really great inflections that provide a tailwind for Applied and we're bringing enabling technology to our customers in a number of different markets. So, one thing that is also a tailwind for us is pricing improvement as we're shipping more valuable products. So, that's part of what you're seeing in that increased gross margin. And I think that we have a great opportunity to continue to drive that going forward.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor. Your question, please.
CJ Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I know you guys don't want to talk about WFE, but I was hoping you could speak to it directionally. How are you thinking about 2024, 2025 more importantly, growth? And maybe perhaps more importantly, in terms of the change in the administration, how you're thinking about the potential risk in terms of adding restrictions or perhaps going the other direction? Would love to hear your first thoughts there.
Gary Dickerson: Okay. Thanks for the question, Stacy -- sorry, CJ, and thanks for staying up for us. So, on the WFE, directionally for '24, so we just closed our fifth year of growth. So, we'll see what the print is across the whole industry, but we would expect it to have shown growth. And then, for '25, if you zoom out, we're talking about $1 trillion semiconductor industry by 2030. I think that's consistent across most of the industry having that view. And we certainly have that view given the added wafer starts and added capacity across the industry basically every single year. So, it's hard to guarantee '25, but I'll just call out that our Q4 was growth year-over-year, our Q1 is growth year-over-year, and we just completed those five years, and we're starting to see that leading-edge component of logic accelerate as the gate-all-around nodes are being invested in across the world. Last, as far as the change in administration, it's early, we really can't speculate on what might change there. So, we'll have to wait for more input on that one. Thank you.
CJ Muse: Very helpful. As a follow-up on gross margins, the 48% now as a floor is fairly pretty good accomplishment. So, would love to hear kind of how you got there and I guess how to think about growth beyond that over time.
Brice Hill: Yeah, I don't think I can be as aggressive to call a floor, but I won't call it peak either. So, 48.4% for Q1, that's mix positive for Q1, but we do expect to continue to make improvements on that 48.0% baseline. So, we continue to have significant cost projects in our pipeline and as we introduce new equipment and improve the value of the equipment that's existing, we'll improve our value pricing. So, we expect to continue to make progress.
CJ Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. On the leading edge, the three big kind of foundries and the IDM among them, one of them is doing extremely well. The other two are not as much. So, when you say that leading edge is very strong, is it -- is the expectation that the one player that is doing very well continues to stay very strong and the others, even if they fall behind, are still sufficient to kind of give the overall industry a strong growth outlook for next year? So, I'm just I guess, the direct question is how much have you handicapped this kind of dichotomy in the market where one pair is doing extremely well and the other two are not doing as well?
Brice Hill: Thanks for the question, Vivek. Yeah, the way that we think about forecasting demand long term for the business really starts with the end markets. So, our view, if you think about datacenter, PC, smartphones, all the things that -- artificial intelligence that drive the leading edge, we think the eventual footprint of capacity will need to match those end-market requirements and it will be sort of independent of which foundries are serving what amount of each -- of that demand. And so, at a high level, we haven't really changed our expectations from the amount of leading-edge capacity that needs to be installed. And so, I would say, as customers change their schedules and their micro factory forecast, our forecast really hasn't changed.
Gary Dickerson: Vivek, this is Gary. What I would add is that, I've been spending a lot of time with all of these different companies. The really big focus for everybody is improvement in energy efficient computing. AI is driving a significant amount of growth, those die sizes are very large. And so, when we look forward not just in '25, but we look over longer term, we see significant growth in leading-edge foundry logic. And the good thing for Applied is that those improvements in energy efficient computing are really enabled through architecture changes like gate-all-around or backside power distribution, where in every one of these architecture inflections, you're improving the power efficiency 20% to 30%. So, it's really, really important. One of the customers I was talking to said that every percent of energy efficiency improvement matters. And as we've talked about, we're really well positioned to gain share as our customers are going through those inflections with new gate-all-around nodes and backside power. So, that puts -- that gives us a really great tailwind going forward. And as Brice said, we really look at this from an overall market standpoint and we're pretty optimistic relative to the growth in leading-edge foundry logic.
Liz Morali: Thanks, Vivek. We'll take our next question.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your question, please.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I have a question for Brice. Brice, I believe on the last earnings call, you talked about China being 20% of your sales on a normalized basis next year. Is that still your view? And some of your peers have talked about decline anywhere ranging from mid-teens to down 30% for their China sales. And I know you're not talking about WFE next year, but is that kind of the right decline for China sales for you guys as well between 15% and 30%?
Brice Hill: Hi, Atif. We have some shaking heads in the room here. We don't recognize -- if I heard you right, we don't recognize the 20%, but I think the last quarter was 32%. Our quarter -- this quarter reported Q4 is 30% for our China as a share of total revenue. And our outlook quarter, Q1, is approximately 30% also. So, we think that's a normalized rate. It was elevated for a few quarters even up into the mid-40%s, and that was because we were shipping that DRAM demand to some specific China customers when it was allowed. Since then, it's come back down to the 30% range. And as we've highlighted in our outlook, that's consistent with our Q1, and we think that's -- when we look over the past several years, we think 30% is approximately normal for the company and that does include all of our businesses. That includes the Semi Systems, that includes our Services business and our Display business, which has significant sales in China.
Atif Malik: Thank you for the clarification.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Gary and Brice, I think you both mentioned the concept of value-based pricing a couple of times in your script and how that's driving gross margin. I know this isn't necessarily a new initiative at Applied, but if you can kind of expand on what you're doing exactly with your customers? Is it primarily tied to your IMS offering or is it broader than that? And which inning are you in as it pertains to you guys essentially trying to capture value? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yeah. Thanks, Toshiya. I would say third inning. And the reason I say that is because we are -- since we had the COVID events, we had supply chain and we had changes in our cost, we also had to reconcile with that. We've always had value pricing in the company. We've always thought about the value of the tools, but that was a bit of a shock in terms of what the cost levels were coming through the supply chain. So, we really had to stimulate our evaluation of the value being provided for each application and especially those integrated applications that are unique to the company. And so, we're in the process of strengthening our training process and our analytical process and our communications with the customers. And since the tools that we're providing and the systems we're providing, we do think create more value for the customers, we're making progress in that.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, Toshiya, if I look across all of the different businesses within Applied, I've never been more optimistic regarding the technology pipeline and product pipeline that we have and our positions around these key inflections that are important for energy efficient computing. So, as you mentioned, the integrated platforms, that's about 30% of our revenue, and those are absolutely crucial for these technology inflections. But I would say that if I look at foundry-logic or DRAM, where we've gained 10 points of share over the last 10 years, or advanced packaging or even in ICAPS, we have new products in the pipeline that will expand our available market and are incredibly valuable for some of these segments. I think we have a really robust pipeline of capabilities and that will help us from a value pricing standpoint. So, as Brice said, I think we have a lot of room to continue to grow.
Toshiya Hari: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Brice, you gave a number just now. You said that advanced node revenue is going to double. You said it was $2.5 billion I think this year. And you said it's going to double next year. Not all that's going to be incremental though because some is going to cannibalize I would think N3, N4, N5. So, do you have a sense of how much of that would be incremental? I mean, I'm sure that some of it is, but do you have a sense of how much of it would be?
Brice Hill: Thanks, Tim. So, yeah, this approximate doubling has to do with our shipments to the gate-all-around nodes across the industry. And what we said is in the fiscal '24, we shipped approximately $2.5 billion of equipment to gate-all-around nodes and we expect that to approximately double next year. And if I think about it, we've also described the increment for gate-all-around for us as approximately $1 billion raising what was a $6 billion investment for 100,000 wafer starts of capacity, wafer starts per month, to $7 billion. So, the increment would be about one-sixth if you're thinking about it from that perspective. And then, I think most of our shipments at this point are on the leading-edge logic are towards gate-all-around nodes. So, most of that is replacing revenue that was at prior nodes in the past.
Timothy Arcuri: Very, very helpful. Thank you, Brice. And then, Gary, I know you talk about $1 trillion in semiconductor revenue, [that's this much value] (ph), longer-term number, but my question is how much WFE spending do you think has to be spent to support that much revenue? And really it kind of gets to what the longer-term WFE intensity is, which used to be 13.5% before COVID and it got to like 17% in 2023, but it's been coming down since then as China has come down. So, how do you think about like for $1 trillion worth of semiconductor revenue, how much WFE do you think the industry has to spend to support that? I don't know, Brice, if you want to answer that or Gary.
Brice Hill: Yeah, I can jump in on that because we have seen elevated intensity this -- the WFE investment, the equipment investment over semiconductor revenues. We've seen that intensity increase largely on that significant ramp in China over the past couple of years as China ramped up capacity. So, we do expect it to decrease a little bit over time as we look forward in the forecast, but we're comfortable at this point that it should stay in the mid-teens, somewhere in the mid-teens as a metric.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Tim, the other thing I would add is that we're very deeply engaged with all of our customers, I would say, more so than ever. This concept of high velocity co-innovation where we're co-innovating with our customers a decade out over multiple technology nodes has never been stronger with all of our innovative technologies, our device integration teams, really deep partnerships with customers. And what we see going forward besides overall capital intensity is increasing intensity in materials engineering and the technologies from Applied Materials. So, I think, again, we have very, very deep visibility across all of these different market segments, and that will put us in a good position.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you, both.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary or Brice, I just wanted to follow-up again on the value-based pricing argument. Is part of it driven by some of these technologies like gate-all-around where it's really difficult to do some of the vertical epi steps and therefore there's a lot more value added to it? The reason I'm asking is, once you get past gate-all-around, go to backside power delivery or even 6F-squared DRAM, does that intensity come down? In other words, gate-all-around is so difficult to do, the next steps might not be as critical? I'm just kind of curious how to think about this value pricing and whether it was a gate-all-around specific thing.
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Krish. This is Gary. Thanks for the question. So, I would say that the entire industry is focused on energy-efficient computing. And we've heard some of the system companies talking about 100x improvements in five years or 10,000 times improvements in 15 years. It's really hard to accomplish those types of improvements. And the value why do these companies go to the most advanced nodes, they go there even though those wafers are more expensive because -- one CEO was telling me even 1% improvement in energy-efficient computing is worth a lot. So, when you think about all of these different nodes -- yes, gate-all-around is difficult, backside power is difficult, 4F-squared and 3D DRAM are difficult. All of these areas are very, very challenging and we have unique capability with our integrated platforms. We have one platform with multiple technologies that enables 50% improvement in resistance and obviously that's really critical for energy-efficient computing. So, I don't think this is a one-shot thing with the first generation of gate-all-around. All of these things I think are critical for customers and Applied is extremely well positioned.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Gary. Very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the team's services business, strong performance, so 21 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth and that trend clearly looks to sustain going into an improving semiconductor demand environment next year. Additionally, you guys have driven a much more annuity-like recurring and attractive revenue profile, however, operating margins are still about a 100 basis points below the 31% level that you drove for five, six consecutive quarters in fiscal '21 and '22 timeframe, and that was at a lower revenue base. And then maybe, about 200 basis points, 300 basis points below your prior long-term targets for low-30% operating profitability on revenue targets that were also lower. So, what's been responsible for the lower operating margin expansion? Is there still line of sight to getting into the low-30% range on continued AGS growth, or is there something sort of structurally that has changed?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Harlan, thanks for the question. There is something structurally that's changed. We have begun allocating more of our corporate expenses and our central expenses that are supporting each of our segments during this year, and that was accountable for a portion of the reduction in operating profit there. So, I think you see us improving our operating profit for that business over the last eight quarters generally. And I think the expectation is we'll continue to be able to make improvements even with those allocations -- that allocation increase that we made.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, Harlan, also there's tremendous pull as customers are going through these inflections in all of these different markets to accelerate time to market for those innovations and then transferring technology, first time right, faster technology transfer and then ramp into high-volume manufacturing, those are big opportunities. We're also driving tremendous innovation in our services and I've been meeting with a lot of the different customers here over the next quarter. There is real traction for many of these service innovations. So, that will continue to drive the value we create for customers and drive our margins higher in the future.
Harlan Sur: No. I appreciate that. And maybe just a quick follow-up. So, as you guys focus on more value capture, especially with your integrated solutions, Gary, you spent a lot of time talking about sort of new technology enablement with these integrated systems. Do your customers also get the additional benefit in terms of better operational and manufacturability dynamics? I mean, I can imagine with an integrated system, you eliminate a lot of the wafer transport, transfer activities, which ultimately increases process module throughput, increases cycle time. You also potentially get smaller tool footprint, right? Is this an accurate assessment in any way to kind of quantify some of these operational benefits with your integrated systems?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, we're always focused on improvements in energy-efficient computing and all of these different architectures, but there is also a huge focus in cost innovation. And cost innovation when we're combining these different technologies together, is one aspect. But the other thing is really helping our customers optimize these new device architectures. So, when we're in these technology discussions with a number of different companies, there are cases where we can simplify processes that really enable them to drive lower costs. Another example is with our pattern-shaping technology that we've talked about where our customers can reduce the number of EUV steps. So, there are a number of those kinds of opportunities. And then getting back to services, again, I was with one of our biggest customers here recently and we were talking about service innovation that can drive their overall operating costs lower. So, this is also a really big focus and I think an opportunity both for our systems business and our service business.
Harlan Sur: Thank you, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Joe Quatrochi: Hey, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that you were seeing DRAM customers accelerate capacity plans especially for HBM. I think most people expect HBM to continue to be strong spending, but are you seeing customers look to add capacity for conventional DRAM? I just want to make sure I understand that comment right. And then, how do we think about just the growth that you talked about sequentially from memory into the January quarter?
Brice Hill: Hi, Joe. We do see customers adding capacity in DRAM in total, more wafer start capacity. I actually haven't calculated how much of that was driven by HBM. What we would say is, about 10% of DRAM wafers right now are allocated towards HBM production, high-bandwidth memory. And the high-bandwidth memory demand is growing at about a 30% rate. So, we do see more capacity allocated each quarter to high-bandwidth memory, and we do see the growth rate there very high. My sense is that doesn't equate to exactly what's being added in the overall capacity footprint, but anyway, we do see capacity increases in the DRAM customers and we do see that market continue to be fairly strong.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. I have a follow-up to the previous question, Brice. If I look at your DRAM, obviously, very strong in fiscal 2024. I think you said 60%-plus growth and you kind of quantified the HBM at $700 million roughly. I think that's roughly about 20 points of growth. So, as I look out to the next, I guess, fiscal year, I'm just trying to understand how to think about overall DRAM growth, because HBM will obviously grow. And I believe there was some China in last 12 months, that's probably declining or already declined. So, all-in, do you expect, I guess, DRAM to grow next year or do you think it's going to be a challenge? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yeah. So, a couple of comments there. Long term, we've talked about the $1 trillion market and our view that -- $1 trillion semiconductor market and our view that capacity will be continued to be added across the ecosystem on the wafer side to support that. I think we've articulated in the past that for WFE, we expect about two-thirds to be foundry logic and one-third to be memory. We haven't gotten specific about what the share is for DRAM, but right now, today, in our Q4 and our Q1 guide, we're seeing a strong DRAM market, and that's a continuation, and we talked about the pull of high-bandwidth memory from the artificial intelligence usage models. So, I think it's fair that we expect capacity to be added over time, and we're not making a call on '25, but those are the dynamics.
Srini Pajjuri: Got it. And then maybe another quick one on NAND. I know you guys have been fairly cautious on WFE spending when it comes to NAND, but there is definitely some optimism about tech transitions and in particular, molyb transitions. So, just want to hear your thoughts about how you're thinking about NAND for next year in terms of tech transitions and the opportunity for you guys.
Brice Hill: Yeah. From a macro perspective, similar to the comments on DRAM, we do see a little bit of growth in NAND in our Q1 outlook. And the dynamic is slightly different at the macro level for NAND and DRAM. On the DRAM side, we do see added capacity, more wafer starts across the ecosystem. On the NAND, we haven't seen that because, I think the bit rate density, so the actual shrink rate of the NAND technologies has been so impressive and so high that it's actually delivered the amount of bits that are in the demand profile. And so, there hasn't been new wafer starts needed on the NAND side. So, most of that has been an upgrade market. So, that dynamic is slightly different. But in any case, we see a little bit of an uptick in the NAND in our outlook for Q1.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.
Brian Chin: Hi there. Appreciate the time this afternoon. It sounds like you still view 30% as a normalized level of China sales, but of course, it did go higher than normalized into the 40%s in recent quarters. So, I was curious, is it reasonable that China could go below 30% in '25 if areas like leading-edge foundry or DRAM improve and ICAPS remains more stable plus or minus?
Brice Hill: Thanks for the question, Brian. I think that most of the variability for us will be based on the health of the ICAPS market in China. That's the vast majority of our business right now. We have served most of the DRAM and NAND business that we can serve and we [can't] (ph) serve leading-edge in China. So, most of -- the vast majority of the business is ICAPS and it will just depend on how that ICAPS market evolves. Earlier, I shared that there's a couple of signals that say the rate of investment might be slower. Those are higher inventory positions and slow end markets that are automotive, industrial, image sensors and analog are markets that are slower, but having said that, our Q4 and Q1 outlook is still strong for ICAPS across the world. And so, we'll just have to see how that matures. We do expect customers to continue to add capacity over the medium term.
Brian Chin: All right. Thank you. Maybe if I could just ask a little bit of a longer-term question here. ASML earlier today was upbeat on its outlook for AI-driven DRAM spending overall. They also talked about lithography intensity increasing for DRAM toward decade end. This seems to differ, I guess, a little bit from your prior messaging around the potential timing and introduction of technologies like vertical transistor DRAM and even 3D DRAM. Can you maybe compare and contrast where the differences here might arise?
Brice Hill: I'll say one thing and then Gary will help here. I think my view is it's complementary, very complementary. So, as there's more business and more demand on the litho side of the equation, that of course, requires more equipment to do the actual materials. So, Gary has a comment.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. We're deeply engaged with all of the memory companies on their DRAM roadmaps. So, relative to the vertical channel transistor, also known as 4F-squared, I think that's where everybody is focused in the near term. We believe that inflection will be more materials engineering intensive. And again, we're really deeply engaged on the key technologies that will enable that architecture inflection. And I would say that everyone is also focused on 3D DRAM and that one is further out in time and that is significantly more materials engineering intensive. So, again, I can't really comment on what other people are seeing, but I would say that we're deeply engaged with all of those different companies on those architectures. We're working with their integration teams, their device teams, and we have high confidence that materials engineering intensity will increase with those inflections.
Brian Chin: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up the strength in ICAPS. You sort of said there's weakness in automotive, industrial, analog and image sensors, that's a lot of the trailing edge category. So, I'm wondering [what's that believe] (ph) that's doing well? And does that sort of imply that it's geopolitically-related spending? Is there -- just what aspect of it is that's still strong?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Thanks, Joe. I think power -- some of the power-related components and I think some of the microcontrollers are stronger than those markets. Those are two that I recall from the discussions. So, I think what we see across ICAPS is it's continued to be fairly strong. It wasn't quite as high in our Q4 '24 as in our Q4 '23, but still a very strong market. So, we'll just have to watch how this evolves. Our perspective is that customers will continue to add capacity as the underlying market continues to grow towards this $1 trillion 2030 semiconductor market. But utilizations right now are a little bit lower than the ideal utilization level. So, we do think there could be some slowing of investment as we go through this year.
Liz Morali: Thanks, Joe. We have time for one last question.
Operator: Certainly. And our final question for today then comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question, please.
Vijay Rakesh: Yeah. Hi. Just a quick question on the China side. Gary and Brice, when you look at the China revenues, do you expect it to kind of hold at these levels going through calendar 2025?
Brice Hill: Thanks, Vijay. In our Q1 guide, we are highlighting that it is also approximately 30%. So -- and looking historically, that's been the number that we've seen historically. And I'll just say that the market for us, I highlighted a few minutes ago, we're not serving much DRAM or NAND and no leading edge at this point. It's mostly the ICAPS business. And so, the fact that it's been restricted to the ICAPS business at this point, it will really change over time with the strength of that particular end market. We do expect that to grow over time. We'll have to see how '25 shakes out as the market matures. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Brice for any further remarks.
Brice Hill: Thank you, operator. I'm pleased with the strong performance we delivered in Q4 and for our fiscal year. We're in a strong position with an industry-leading portfolio of products and services and poised to uniquely benefit from the secular megatrends driving technology demand. Thank you for joining today's call. And Liz, please close the call.
Liz Morali: Thank you, Brice, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. A replay of today's call will be available on the Investor Relations website by 5 pm Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-08-15 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's third quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q filing with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. And with that introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. With record revenues in our third quarter, and earnings towards the high-end of our guided range, Applied Materials continues to deliver strong results in 2024. Secular trends are growing our available market, and our unique and connected portfolio of capabilities, products and services, positions us to outperform the industry over the longer term. At our recent investor event at SEMICON West, leaders from our semiconductor business shared their perspective on the powerful, multi-decade technology trends driving the industry forward, and explained the role Applied is playing to enable the next generations of semiconductor technology. In today's call, I will summarize some of the key themes we talked about at that event including: how advancing energy-efficient computing performance is critical to deploying AI at scale, why the energy-efficient computing roadmap is increasingly enabled by materials engineering and Applied Materials, and how we are working in new ways to accelerate this complex roadmap and create new growth opportunities for Applied. Semiconductors provide the foundation for tectonic shifts in technology that will reshape the global economy over the next several decades, including AI, IoT, robotics, electric and autonomous vehicles, and clean energy. These multi-trillion-dollar global inflections are increasing demand for chips and driving the need for significant advances in semiconductor technology. The biggest tectonic shift of all is AI, and the race for AI leadership will, in large part, be determined by which companies in the semiconductor industry are first to deliver substantial improvements in energy-efficient compute performance. In our discussions with leading AI companies, they are telling us that reducing power-per-operation is now more important than increasing operations-per-second. They are also talking about the need to drive a 10,000 times improvement in performance-per-watt over the next 15 years. Evolutionary innovation is insufficient to deliver improvements of this magnitude, and we are seeing the emergence of a new industry playbook made up of major device architecture inflections in logic, memory and advanced packaging. These device architecture inflections are increasingly enabled by materials science and materials engineering where Applied is the clear market and technology leader. For AI, the advanced chips in the datacenter, used for training AI models, are built upon four critical categories of semiconductor technology: leading-edge logic, high-performance DRAM, high-bandwidth memory enabled by die-stacking technology and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together in a single integrated package. In leading-edge logic, key device inflections, in both transistor and interconnect, are currently moving from chipmakers' R&D pilot lines to high-volume production. The transition from FinFET to gate-all-around transistors grows Applied's available market for the transistor module from around $6 billion to approximately $7 billion for every 100,000 wafer-starts-per-month of capacity. We also expect to gain share through the gate-all-around transition and we're on track to capture more than 50% of the process equipment spending for the transistor fabrication steps. For the interconnect module, our available market is also about $6 billion for every 100,000 wafer- starts-per-month. We forecast this will also grow by about $1 billion with the implementation of Backside Power Delivery, and we expect to win more than 50% of the applications we address in interconnect when Backside Power ramps in volume manufacturing. In DRAM, we have also established clear leadership in process equipment, and are in a great position for future growth. Over the past decade, we have grown our market share in DRAM by around 10 points. As DRAM plays a critical role in energy-efficient computing performance, there is a huge focus on advancing the roadmap. The next major DRAM inflection, from 6F-squared to 4F-squared, or vertical transistor architectures, is materials-enabled, and we expect our market opportunity to grow by approximately 10% to around $6.5 billion for each 100,000 wafer-starts-per-month of capacity. We also expect to increase our share based on our position to enable the 4F-squared inflection. In addition, we believe the subsequent transition to 3D DRAM will grow our addressable market by an incremental 15%, further compounding Applied's opportunity. In the die-stacking technologies that enable high-bandwidth memory, we also have strong leadership positions, both in micro-bump and through-silicon via. We have seen demand for high-bandwidth memory accelerating in 2024 and expect to generate more than $600 million of HBM packaging revenue this year, which is approximately six times 2023. Overall, including HBM, we expect revenue from our advanced packaging product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.7 billion in 2024. We believe this business can double in size over the next several years, as heterogenous integration is more widely adopted and we introduce new solutions that grow our addressable market. Advanced logic, high-performance DRAM, high-bandwidth memory, and advanced packaging are all great examples of how future device architecture inflections are increasingly enabled by materials engineering. As a result, we expect materials engineering, as a percentage of total wafer fab equipment, to grow in both logic and memory through the coming node transitions. At the same time, thanks to our inflection-focused approach to R&D, and the strong positions we've established at these future device architecture inflections, we expect to capture more of the expanded opportunities we serve. The value of bringing next-generation semiconductor technology to market faster has never been greater. At Applied, our strategy and investments are focused on accelerating the industry's roadmap to support the highest growth-rate global inflections spanning: AI datacenters, edge-AI and IoT, robotics, electric vehicles and clean energy. This strategy is enabled by three pillars: First, we have built a broad, unique and connected portfolio of highly enabling technologies. As well as providing traditional, best-in-class unit processes, we can co-optimize, combine, and integrate our technologies to deliver more comprehensive solutions that address higher-value challenges for our customers. These integrated 'fab-in-a-fab' solutions have grown from approximately 20% of our semiconductor products revenue in 2019 to around 30% today. We expect demand for our integrated products to continue growing, both at the leading-edge and from our ICAPS customers who are serving specialty markets. Second, we are changing the way we work inside and outside the company. Over the past five years, we have built new capabilities and dedicated teams focused on module integration, device design and simulation, data analytics and AI, advanced packaging, and ICAPS. At the same time, we are driving earlier, deeper and more extensive collaboration with our customers and partners to win the device architecture inflection races, accelerate mutual success rates, and increase investment efficiencies. To further support these collaborative partnerships, we will build out our global EPIC platform over the next several years, which is specifically designed for high-velocity innovation and commercialization of next-generation technologies. And third, we are helping customers transfer new technology into high-volume manufacturing faster and then optimize performance, yield, output, and cost in their factory operations. This is supporting double-digit growth in services, with a high percentage of our service revenue coming from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. Overall, AGS delivered another record quarter, which is their 20th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Before I hand over to Brice, I will quickly summarize. Applied Materials is delivering record results in 2024, and we are in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer-term. Semiconductors are the foundation for tectonic shifts in technology which will reshape the global economy over the next several decades. This is driving increasing demand for chips as well at the need for significant advances in semiconductor innovation. The race for AI leadership depends on delivering significant improvements in energy-efficient compute performance in the range of 10,000 times over the next 15 years. The need for more energy-efficient compute is driving major device architecture inflections within the semiconductor roadmap that are enabled by materials engineering and Applied Materials' innovations. This expands our served market and is accretive to our share, and the increasingly complex industry roadmap creates new collaboration and growth opportunities for Applied, enabled by our broad, unique and connected portfolio of capabilities, products and services. Finally, as you may be aware, Mike Sullivan will be retiring at the end of this calendar year and handing the reigns to Liz Morali, who recently joined Applied as our new Head of Investor Relations. I would like to say a huge thank you to Mike for his many contributions to the success of our company and congratulate him on an outstanding career. Now, over to Brice.
Brice Hill: Thank you, Gary. And I'd like to thank our teams for their strong execution this quarter which enabled us to deliver record revenue, improved operational performance, and healthy gross margin. Today, I'll summarize the market environment, discuss our Q3 performance, and share our Q4 outlook. As Gary mentioned, Mike Sullivan plans to retire from Applied at the end of this calendar year. Liz Morali has joined Applied as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Mike and Liz are working on a smooth handoff of the IR function beginning with our November earnings call. I hope you'll join Gary and me in congratulating Mike on his extraordinary career and leadership, and welcoming Liz to Applied Materials. Beginning with the business environment, our revenue in Q3 as well as our outlook for Q4 reflect the industry's focus on the major inflections Gary highlighted earlier. We are seeing particularly strong pull related to AI and data center computing. Specifically, our DRAM system shipments remained strong even as DRAM sales in China decline as anticipated. Adoption of high-bandwidth memory and other forms of advanced packaging continues to grow. And in foundry-logic, leading-edge investment is growing each quarter and becoming a larger percentage of our mix while ICAPS demand remains strong overall. Turning to our Q3 performance, we delivered record revenue of $6.78 billion, which was up 5% year-over- year, with growth in all three segments. Operationally, we saw improvements in a number of key metrics such as manufacturing cycle times, linearity and on-time delivery. These improvements give me confidence that we are preparing the company to more efficiently support the growth we are forecasting in the years ahead. The strong operational performance helped us deliver non-GAAP gross margin of 47.4%, which was up 100 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.26 billion were up 8% year-over-year, and over 70% of the increase was driven by R&D programs aimed at the technology inflections Gary described. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.12 was up 12% year-over-year and $0.01 below our highest EPS quarter ever. Turning to cash flows and profit distributions in Q3, we generated nearly $2.4 billion in operating cash flow and over $2 billion in free cash flow. We distributed nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders including the first $0.40 per-share dividend and $861 million in stock buybacks. Turning to the segments, Semiconductor Systems sales were $4.92 billion in Q3, up 5% year-over-year. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. From a device perspective, our DRAM sales grew nearly 50% year-over-year to $1.16 billion. Our DRAM sales in China declined sequentially as we anticipated, and this contributed to our company revenue in China declining by 11 percentage points sequentially to 32%, which is in line with our longer-term average inclusive of Semi Systems, AGS and Display. Our NAND memory sales grew 10% year-over-year to $203 million. Our foundry-logic sales were down 4% year-over-year to $3.56 billion. Leading-edge foundry-logic demand was lower year-over-year but continued to strengthen on a sequential basis. We continue to expect to generate more than $2.5 billion in system revenue from gate-all-around nodes this calendar year, with the potential to more than double next year. Our ICAPS business remained strong overall, with pockets of weakness in the auto and industrial end markets. Longer term, we expect the ICAPS market to remain around half the foundry-logic market as major inflections in IoT, autonomous and electric vehicles, and the global energy transformation are expected to drive mid- to high-single-digit, through-cycle growth in ICAPS semiconductors well into the future. We are investing in new products to compete in more areas of the ICAPS semiconductor and packaging ecosystem. We are also working with our customers to enable new power and sensor device architecture inflections using our co-optimized and integrated materials systems. Next, Applied Global Services delivered record revenue of $1.58 billion in Q3, which was up 8% year-over- year. AGS recurring parts, services and software revenue grew more than twice as fast as overall segment revenue during the quarter. AGS non-GAAP operating margin of 29.6% was up 230 basis points year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating profit was a record $467 million. From a business perspective, customer factory utilization continued to strengthen during the quarter across memory, foundry-logic and advanced packaging. Our leading indicators of future AGS growth remain positive. Our installed base of systems and chambers increased 7% year-over-year, and our average revenue-per-unit increased even more. Our average subscription agreement length increased to 2.8 years, and the renewal rate was above 90%. We continue to expect AGS to grow at a low double-digit rate over the long term. As a reminder, the consistency of our profitable growth in services gives us confidence in our ability to continue to increase our dividend per share. In fact, over the past 10 years, we have increased the dividend per share at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 15%. Moving to Display, Q3 revenue of $251 million was up 7% year-over-year, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 6.4%. While LCD equipment spending remains low, we are becoming more confident that the OLED technology found in smartphones will be adopted in notebook PCs and tablets whose larger screen sizes will require a significant increase in capital investments. Applied has built a leadership position in deposition and e-Beam metrology technologies for the display industry and we are well positioned to enable our customers to convert the notebook PC and tablet markets to OLED technology over the coming years. Now, I'll share our guidance for Q4. We expect company revenue of $6.93 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.18, plus or minus $0.18, both up 3% year-over-year at the midpoint. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $5.1 billion, which is up 4% year-over-year, AGS revenue of about $1.61 billion, which is up 9% year-over-year, and Display revenue of around $200 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47.4%, and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.275 billion. Finally, we are modeling a tax rate of 12.5%. Thank you, and now Mike, let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have another question, please re-queue and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
CJ Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, for my question, I was hoping you could speak to how your outlook for WFE in the second half of the year and for all of 2025 has evolved over the last three months. Obviously, tremendous strength, anything AI related, but elsewhere kind of seasonal at best. So I guess, first part of the question is, can you share with us how you're thinking about your silicon business in the second half of calendar '24 versus the first half? And then, the early signs that you see today and how that informs kind of your view both positive and negative into 2025? Thanks so much.
Brice Hill: Okay, CJ, thanks for joining the call. I think what we're seeing in the business today when we look at Q3 and our Q4 outlook, very strong energy around the AI inflections that Gary talked about. So, leading-edge is accelerating. We highlighted that in the prepared remarks. We're -- our forecast for $2.5 billion of gate-all-around related equipment in this fiscal year, we haven't changed that forecast. That stays the same. And when we think about DRAM and HBM memory, those kind of all go along with this energy we're seeing around the AI inflections and investments in that area. At the same time, our ICAPS business in both Q3 and Q4 remains very strong. We think that's robust. We can dig into that a little bit more during the call. But if anything, over the last 30 days, you ask us how we're feeling about the outlook, I would say the ICAPS business continues. It seems like every quarter, we sort of raise our expectations with respect to ICAPS. So, a lot of energy around leading-edge. ICAPS remaining strong. A very strong year for DRAM and HBM. Those are kind of key themes. For '25, we're not giving specific guidance, but we just say, we're pretty enthusiastic about gate-all-around and the technologies we've talked about on the leading-edge.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into the China revenues a little bit. So, 32% of revenue this quarter. It sounds like a lot of that was DRAM. I guess, was it all DRAM? And then, in the guidance for next quarter and I guess your expectations going forward from there, do you expect the China mix to be staying around these levels in the low 30% or does it go higher or lower? Is there anything else going on with China that we need to be aware of?
Brice Hill: Great. Thanks for joining, Stacy. So, yeah, on the 32%, I'll shift your perspective on that just a little bit. So, the 32% is almost no DRAM to China. So, you've got it right. Our business mix to China declined to 32%. And if I think back in time, just to remind everybody, if we go just over a year back, it was like 17% mix to China. We were having supply chain issues. So, it was very low at that point. In the last three quarters, we bounced up to the mid-40%s while we served the DRAM that we could ship and that's the prior three quarters. And we feel this quarter 32% is probably normal for us or in the normal range for us, that's across our entire business for shipments to China. And what it really represents is ICAPS. And the ICAPS market in total has been very robust. We think it will be a record year in our fiscal year for ICAPS. And China also, we would call it robust. There's -- we're adding customers. Utilizations are improving. It's a wide variety of products and factories. So, we think that market is robust both in Q3 and in Q4. So that gives you a sense of what's happening for us. And then, next quarter, we'll have a small amount of DRAM, but nothing like we've had the prior three quarters.
Stacy Rasgon: So, is it fair to say that you still see the mix in the low-30%s next quarter to China?
Brice Hill: Yeah, we expect that mix approximately normal, which we call 30% for the next quarter, yes.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.
Brice Hill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Brice, just to follow-up to the previous question on China DRAM, obviously, you said it's near zero levels. Can you talk to your visibility as to when -- if you're seeing any hope on the horizon? Do you expect DRAM to come back at some point in China? And then, also ICAPS, you said the demand is pretty strong in China. Can you talk to what kind of trends you're seeing outside of China for ICAPS? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks, Srini. Thanks for joining. So, yeah, the China DRAM in Q3 and Q4 will be at nominal levels. We have speculated you may see new investments in DRAM there. I don't have any comments to make on that specifically for the roadmap, but I would say that DRAM globally is very strong, should be a very, very strong year for DRAM. Of course, that includes some of that China volume, but we think that goes along with the mix to HBM and utilizations in DRAM have improved and there's a lot of energy around the high-bandwidth memory for the leading-edge systems. And then, on the ICAPS side, no surprise here for probably anybody. We expect the edge technologies that we describe as ICAPS to grow mid- to high-single-digits over time. And that's driven by the inflections that we talk about, which is clean energy, renewable power, electrification, those sorts of -- AI edge sensors, all those sorts of usages. So mid- to high-single-digits is our view long term. And when we look at China for both Q3 and Q4 and the entire ICAPS business, I said before, it's probably going to be a record for us in our fiscal year. And it's not just China, we've had regions, other regions grow during this quarter.
Srini Pajjuri: Got it. Thanks, Brice.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious if we should bake in the impact of any CapEx cuts that were announced recently at Intel. What does that imply for just the overall WFE market for the remainder of the year and into next year? From your comments, it doesn't seem like it's having a big impact. Is the assumption that whatever CapEx has been cut there is being increased somewhere else, or just what are the puts and takes? Because it is a fairly sizable CapEx cut, which we are saying is more WFE in terms of the mix.
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks for joining, Vivek. Our outlook, we're not changing our outlook. We're still saying $2.5 billion on the leading-edge for gate-all-around in this fiscal year. And when we think about next year, we've just had -- we've had every quarter accelerating this year in the leading-edge and we think that's being driven by a lot of the excitement around AI and AI datacenter. So, we get as you -- I think you know, we get regular updates from our customers and our outlook that we've just given for Q4 is up to date with all of our customers. So, I think we tend to think of the market as a macro level. Customers update us all the time, but no real change to our view for leading-edge looking forward.
Vivek Arya: Thank you, Brice.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question, please.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. Question is on foundry-logic, and perhaps you could give some color on the growth you're expecting into '25 driven by some of the new process nodes such as gate-all-around as compared to capacity, because we know foundry capacity has -- additions have taken a pause here. Are you seeing any signs of that starting to improve either as you go through the second half of '24 into '25?
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks, Chris, and thanks for joining. When we think about leading-logic, actually I'll make a comment for utilizations. We've seen utilizations improve in every single end market this quarter and our expectation is for that to continue next quarter. So, DRAM, NAND, ICAPS and leading-edge. And no change to our expectation on absolute leading-edge investment, gate-all-around technologies, not changing our number for this fiscal year. And we do think it's a harbinger for acceleration next year as we look forward. We're not giving a guide for '25, but we think there's a lot of energy around the AI markets and we see that in HBM, we see that in DRAM, we see that in leading-edge acceleration. So, we'll hope that those trends continue.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Krish Sankar: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary or Brice, I'm kind of curious about -- I know you don't want to comment on next year, but qualitatively, you see there's optimism on DRAM and NAND WFE is growing, but if you strip out HBM, you're beginning to see big demand in memory pricing, moderate for DDR and NAND compared to the first half of this year. So, I'm curious how to think about DRAM and NAND WFE next year relative to this year, and what end markets actually drive up spending next year?
Brice Hill: Okay, Chris. You're right, we won't give a guide for '25 specifically, but we do think that DRAM -- even outside of HBM, we do think that DRAM will put new capacity in place, so we expect investment in DRAM. There has been additions in wafer start capacity in DRAM, and there's more allocation of the DRAM capacity to HBM as you sort of highlight. So, the investment level there is higher than NAND. Looking forward to NAND, NAND still remains fairly low, but we did see, as I highlighted, utilizations improving. I would call them probably normal range for both DRAM and NAND. We see prices improve. We saw inventory positions improve at the vendors. So, we think it's a more positive environment looking forward than prior quarters for actually both memory technologies.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Brice.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. It looks like you had some good solid growth from the services business again. Are you benefiting there from the utilization increases in memory that you just talked about? Are you seeing offsetting utilization declines on the ICAPS services side? And then, any indication of customers worry about export controls, stockpiling on spares, anything like that? Just any puts and takes around that service growth? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Hi, Joe. Yes, thank you. Services business, very exciting for us. We grew 8% year-over-year in Q3, 9% is our expectation for Q4. And just a reminder for everybody, we expect low double-digit growth going forward. We're expanding our services book with customers, kind of getting into information, AI-related services that help them ramp et cetera. We actually did expect a little more growth in Q3. We had thought we would grow double-digits this year. We're just short of that, and it's because utilization, while it grew, it grew a little bit less than we -- or a little bit slower than we thought. So, there's good news here. Utilizations are improving across the whole system, 8% year-over-year growth for us, and we expect that to pick up, as I highlighted, as we go into Q3 and looking forward. And just one other comment just for the rest of the investors. The other thing with this business since it's mostly recurring revenue for us about 85%, that gives us a very stable operating profit and growing. And so, we think about our dividend as being enabled by the profits from the services business and that gives us confidence we'll be able to raise our dividend looking forward.
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Joe. Just maybe a little bit more color. If you look at what really all of our customers are focused on, there is a race for these new device architectures and the complexity is going up a significant. And in the prepared remarks, I talked about, about 30% of our tools are these integrated platforms that have a high degree of complexity. So, as these customers are racing to bring these new devices, complex devices to market, and also we're shipping more and more of these integrated platforms with multiple technologies, that also gives us a really good tailwind.
Joseph Moore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Joe Quatrochi: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask about the advanced packaging. I think based on the revenue expectations you have for HBM and advanced packaging, it implied basically that the non-memory advanced packaging relatively unchanged year-over-year. Is that the right way to think about it? And if so, why wouldn't that grow this year?
Brice Hill: I think so, Joe. In our forecast, we highlighted that advanced packaging was $1.1 billion last year, should grow to $1.7 billion this year, and we highlighted that $600 million of the growth would come from HBM-related equipment. So, I think you're thinking about it right. It was probably stable this year with HBM, high-bandwidth memory, driving the growth in that area. And again, we would point back to the energy around high performance systems and sort of the race Gary talks about to develop systems optimized for the AI workload. So, there's a lot of energy there at this point. And then just the last thing is we have highlighted that, that total packaging business sort of, to your point, $1.7 billion, we think it has the opportunity to double over several years looking forward given the energy around advanced packaging technologies. So, we'll keep investing there.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I was hoping you could speak to gross margins and how you're thinking about profitability going forward, the puts and takes price, Brice. And Gary, you talked about complexity growing and how things like IMS contributing toward 30% of your business and that number growing over time. I would think your ability to price would improve going forward. What am I missing in terms of again the puts and takes as it pertains to gross margins? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thank you, Toshiya. I'll start on that. So, 47.4% gross margin for us in the quarter. We're actually very pleased with our performance in cost and pricing this quarter. And I'll just highlight as our mix to China, which are generally smaller customers declined during the quarter to 32%, that gave us some headwinds on the gross margin side. We were able to get some pricing performance and also some cost improvements and improvements in managing our inventory that helped us offset that mix decline and deliver 47.4% in the quarter. Since the China mix is 32%, we call that normal. I'll say now that 47.4% should be approximately our baseline level. And then, we look forward, we've talked about a goal of getting to 48% or higher next year, that's still our goal. We think we can make improvements going forward. There's a couple of headwinds if services or display grow faster than the core business that can be a headwind. But that's still our goal and we think we'll make -- continue to make cost and pricing improvements. And then, Gary on the...
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, Toshiya, again, our focus is really to enable our customers to accelerate their innovations for these new architectures especially around AI datacenter. That datacenter will pass smartphones and PCs relative to wafer starts. Everybody is focused on energy-efficient computing. So, these inflections are incredibly important for the entire ecosystem. Whoever gets there first wins big and everybody else is left behind. So, we're driving tremendous innovations in foundry-logic, leading-edge, high-bandwidth memory, DRAM, there's new architecture inflections, I talked about 4F-squared, advanced packaging. So, our positions in all of those inflections are very strong. We're on track to capture more than 50% of the inflection spending as those new devices ramp. And our goal is to move the needle for our customers and for Applied, and that includes how we drive value for them and how we drive our margins higher.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
Harlan Sur: Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, as we look at those companies that are pushing the absolute limits on advanced manufacturing technologies like 2-nanometer and 3-nanometer, and they're maxing out their [radical field] (ph) limits, they're also pushing advanced packaging technologies. Their design -- these are the guys that are designing the AI and accelerated compute GPUs, accelerators, for example. So, what we're hearing is that most of today's designs on these next-generation chips are targeting [indiscernible] second half of '25 and beyond. They're specifically focused around these new 3D SoIC architectures. So, using hybrid bonding, chip-stacking approach, 3-nanometer on 3-nanometer die, 2-nanometer die on 3-nanometer die. The manufacturability challenges here are pretty significant, right? But similar to your front-end integrated solutions, I mean, the team has been working on an integrated hybrid bonding system with some of your partners. What's the timeline for introducing these integrated solutions? And will you be trying to intercept these next-generation of 3D SoIC solutions coming to market, let's say, in the 2026 timeframe?
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Harlan. Thanks for the question. So, heterogeneous integration is one of the biggest areas of focus for Applied and for the entire industry. At our AI event, along with AMD at SEMICON, there was a discussion around driving 100x improvement in energy-efficient computing. So again, this is the big race that everybody is focused on, and certainly packaging is a key part of that. So, we're in deep engagements, really multiple technology nodes, five, 10 years out into the future, and there's going to be tremendous innovations. If you look even at new DRAM technologies like 4F-squared or high-bandwidth memory, you're going to see adoption of hybrid bonding technologies that are going to be really important for those parts of this ecosystem. And you mentioned what's happening from a logic standpoint. So, I think the great thing for Applied is we have this broad portfolio in packaging. We have, as you mentioned, the hybrid bonding, digital lithography. We have other new technologies in the pipeline that even expand our portfolio further. We have an advanced full flow packaging lab in Singapore, where we're driving co-innovation with our customers to accelerate those architecture inflections. So, I think this is going to be one of the most exciting segments of the market going forward. We're at about $1.7 billion today. We've talked about doubling the packaging revenue over the next few years. And I think it's going to keep going from there. Again, this is a really key part of the industry drive for energy-efficient computing.
Harlan Sur: Thank you, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Your question, please.
Charles Shi: Hi, good afternoon. I want to follow-up on the China question. Looks like your China revenue has well past the peak around almost the $3 billion per quarter level. Now it's down to like in the low $2 billion. And based on the commentary, it sounds like you are still expecting roughly 40%-ish of the China revenue growth year-on-year. But I mean, should the current dollar revenue level sustain into this year? I'm just hoping if you can give us any color because that would imply the China revenue probably is going down year-on-year, roughly 15%, 20% next year. I know you're not guiding, but that will be the conclusion I draw up on all the commentary you provided. Plus, I do want to get a little bit more insights. If I compare the China revenue performance of Applied Materials with some of your process control peers like KLA, they were expecting China to be flat into the second half, but you're obviously seeing a half of the half decline. Since you have the PDC business and I was hoping you definitely will have some insights into what drives the dispersion there. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay, Charles. Thanks for joining. I think I would separate between ICAPS, the edge technology markets and the DRAM market for China. We had three quarters with elevated shipments that we described where we caught up on what was allowed from a DRAM perspective. If you separate that out, we're currently not expecting that to repeat at least nothing near that magnitude for next year. So that leaves us with the ICAPS market. And what we expect in the ICAPS market, our Q3 and Q4 and all of this year has been very strong in ICAPS. When we look at China in particular, utilizations are improving. We're adding customers. We've got a large number of factory projects that are building out. So, if you strip out your estimate for those extraordinary DRAM shipments the last three quarters, our expectation over time is that the ICAPS market will grow. We say mid- to high-single-digits. We will make a call for next year, but we would expect growth over time.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.
Brian Chin: Hi, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a question. So, if I look at the past three years, past three 10-Ks, TSMC was your largest customer. But they weren't 10% in either the April or January quarters. Taiwan, as a geography, was a little higher this quarter. Did TSMC cross the 10% threshold in fiscal 3Q? And then, even bigger picture, this overall pattern would seem to suggest a pretty favorable year-over-year compare moving into 2025 when you think about the type of spending gate-all-around and expansions being discussed. And so just kind of wanted to get maybe your view on that.
Brice Hill: Yes. TSMC was a 10% customer in Q3 and we think obviously they're a large part of that leading-edge investment when we think about the gate-all-around technologies and lot of the energy being driven there as we look forward. One of the other callers talked about the need for innovation and Gary talked about the need for innovation on leading-edge. There's a lot of energy around that. We see acceleration each quarter on -- of this year on leading-edge and really haven't changed our outlook as we've moved through the year.
Brian Chin: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Jefferies. Your question, please.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, thanks for letting me ask a question. I was maybe a little confused on some of the history with ICAPS and the strength. I thought you were talking about last quarter that segment kind of being down slightly. I think you just said mid- to high-single-digits. So, maybe I have my reference point wrong, but also maybe it'd be helpful if you could just talk about the growth you saw in July, 15% sequentially for foundry-logic. Can you just relate that to leading-edge in ICAPS? I think the reception is leading-edge is very strong, but it sounds like your comments on ICAPS are suggesting that ICAPS is also strong. But then I'm trying to put that all with like the comment that it's going to be 50% of the mix, which I think that -- I thought that business is running a lot higher. So, if you kind of just help the full history and then how July played out would be helpful.
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks, Blayne. So, in the quarter, we did see strength in both end markets, leading-logic and ICAPS. Leading-logic is accelerating every quarter this year and we said ICAPS is very strong and continues to be strong throughout the year. This will probably be a record year for us in ICAPS for our fiscal year anyway. And so, leading-logic is accelerating based on the gate-all-around investments and the AI trends that we're talking about. And then, ICAPS, the mid- to high-single-digits was a longer-term forecast. We've had utilizations improving. And when we think about that market, we don't give a guide for next year, but we think there will be continued growth in the mid- to high-single-digits as all those different end markets like AI sensors, electrification, autonomous vehicles, renewable energy, all those end markets continue to build out and grow faster than GDP. That's our expectation.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks for that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jed Dorsheimer from William Blair. Your question, please. [Operator Instructions]
Jed Dorsheimer: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just a two-part one on the ICAPS, Gary. So first, in that business, I was just over in some of your -- some of the fabs or your customers over in Malaysia last week and it seems like capacity expansion outside of China has started again after some of the EV pressures have shifted to opportunities in power density in datacenters. So, I'm just wondering if you could comment on that. And then secondly, just as it relates to services for ICAPS, is that the same as on leading-edge or are there nuances in terms of the amount and timing there? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Jed. Yeah. So, ICAPS, we're very bullish on ICAPS longer term. Brice talked about kind of mid-, high-single-digit growth rates in ICAPS over time, growth driven by all of those different segments, IoT, industrial automation, robotics, really edge computing also for AI, we think that's going to be a really strong business over -- I think many of the people on the call know that over five years ago, it's actually April 12, 2019, we formed our ICAPS group. And since we formed that group, just to focus on that market for IoT, communication, auto power and sensors, we've had share gains in that market. We've introduced more than 20 major new ICAPS products. And this group is just completely focused on innovation in those device segments. And there are races that are happening there. Your comment on what's happening on the different device segments, if you look at power electronics, there will be some major architecture inflections that will happen there that are important for electric vehicles and renewable energy. And we have an ICAPS architecture innovation group working -- co-innovating with our customers on those new ICAPS architectures. That's part of the strategy that we've built over the last five years. We have new products that are in the pipeline that will serve large ICAPS' new segments and new products for cost competitive applications. So again, it's been a big focus for us over a number of years. We've built tremendous capabilities. From a service standpoint, ICAPS is also a good market for us, and that's part of that overall growth opportunity for us, not only on systems where we've gained a significant amount of share. I'm very positive on how we're positioned. The actions that we've taken, I think really position us going forward in ICAPS. Brice, I don't know if you want to add anything else.
Brice Hill: No, I would just say that two of our regions grew during this Q3. So, if the question is, is there investment in other areas of the world? Absolutely. And we expect that to continue. Thanks for the question, Jed.
Michael Sullivan: And operator, we have time for two more questions, please.
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your question, please.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just a very quick follow-up for Brice. If you could give us an update with the progression towards that 48%, 49% gross margin target, I assume that's for fiscal year '25? And how the funding for the EPIC R&D center, which I think is a $4 billion project is going to impact those targets? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Mehdi. So, the update -- the gross margin at 47.4%, we expect to make -- we talked about very gradual improvements as we work towards that 48%, and that would still be my expectation. You see actually the movement between last quarter and this quarter was modest. We fought those headwinds that we had from a mix perspective. On the EPIC, we did get the notice that we're not getting the grants, but EPIC, that's an important platform for us. It stands for Equipment, Process Innovation and Commercialization. It's going to allow us to accelerate co-innovation with all of our customers. We are continuing with that investment. It will elevate our CapEx as we look forward. And we are benefiting from the investment tax credit that's related to those types of projects. So, we still do have some help from the government from that perspective. And just a couple other modeling notes since we're on CapEx. So, as we look forward, the CapEx will -- for the EPIC center and in general will be at a higher run rate than we've had in the past. If you look forward in your modeling, just wanted to highlight that Q1 will be our normal step-up for pay-related increases and that you can look at the history to see what that step-up should look like if you're modeling that. And then the last piece would be our tax rate. Tax rate next year expectation will be 14% versus the 12.5% this year as more of our mix will be -- more of our worldwide mix will be US related. So that will change the tax mix. So thanks for the opportunity to get those in there.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, Mehdi, this is Gary. Maybe just a little bit more color on EPIC. As we've talked about, the whole industry is in a race to be first to market to deliver innovations for energy efficient computing. So, we -- in discussions with our partners, our customers and partners, we really believe that EPIC can enable us to innovate the way we innovate, really innovate in parallel, so accelerating both for our customers and partners and for Applied, our ability to bring those energy-efficient innovations to market. So, the concept we're getting tremendous traction and pull with our customers and partners. And we also think of EPIC as a global platform. So, where we make investments is going to be based on incentives, talents, proximity to innovation ecosystem. So, we are moving forward for sure with this EPIC concept. Very good traction with customers. And again, over the last several years, we've built out this innovation engine inside Applied Materials. We have architecture innovation teams that are working on ICAPS. They're working on foundry-logic and DRAM and packaging. We have this unique and connected portfolio of materials innovations that are crucial for all of those major inflections. So, EPIC is a way for us to innovate the way we innovate to move all of that in parallel to accelerate all of these major inflections that are crucial for AI, datacenter and all those major tectonic shifts in technology that we talked about earlier. But again, where we invest is going to be based on incentives, talent and proximity to local innovation ecosystem.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thanks, Mehdi, for your question. I think we're approaching the end of the hour. So, Brice, I'm going to go ahead and ask if you have any closing thoughts for us.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Mike. From my perspective, I'm pleased that the investments we've been making in the technology roadmap inflections and also in our operational capabilities are showing up in our financial results this quarter on both the revenue and gross margin lines. I believe we put the company in a great position to grow along with megatrends like datacenter AI as a whole host of new technologies come to market across leading-edge, foundry-logic, DRAM, advanced packaging and ICAPS specialty chips. We have the fuel we need to keep driving the materials engineering roadmap with our customers, while also distributing profits to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Gary will be at the Goldman Sachs Conference in San Francisco on September 11, and I hope to see many of you at the Citi Conference in New York on September 4. Mike, thank you, and please close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Brice. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of today's call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by 5 o'clock Pacific Time. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-05-16 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's second quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q filing with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On Tuesday morning, July 9th, from 7:30 to 9 a.m., Applied will host a technology breakfast event at Semicon West in San Francisco. Joining us will be Dr. Prabu Raja, President of Applied's Semiconductor Products Group, along with Mark Fuselier, who is Senior Vice President of Technology and Product Engineering at AMD. After Mark shares AMD's AI computing technology vision, Applied's experts will share our advanced materials engineering roadmap for making future AI chips. We'll outline device architecture inflections in logic, including transistors, frontside wiring and backside power, along with DRAM, high-bandwidth memory, and other forms of advanced packaging. We hope you'll join us. And with that introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. With second quarter revenue and earnings towards the high-end of our guided range, Applied Materials continues to deliver strong performance in 2024, and we are in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer-term. Semiconductors are the foundation of huge technology trends reshaping the global economy. These trends are driving demand for more chip manufacturing capacity, as well as better chips with higher performance and improved energy-efficiency. Key inflections that underpin the semiconductor roadmap are enabled by Applied Materials and will support our ongoing outperformance as next-generation chip technologies move into high-volume production. In addition, the complexity of implementing the industry's roadmap and bringing new semiconductor technologies to market is driving earlier, deeper and broader collaboration with customers, as well as supporting double-digit growth for our service business. In my prepared remarks today, I'll provide some examples of how Applied's innovations are helping to enable multi-trillion-dollar technology inflections, including AI. I'll explain how this translates to our performance in the near-term, and our future growth potential. I'll also describe how we are working with our customers and partners to accelerate major semiconductor inflections all the way from research and development to high-volume manufacturing, and by doing this, how we are capturing more value in our service business. I'll start with a big picture perspective. Tectonic shifts in technology, including AI, IoT and automation, electric and autonomous vehicles and clean energy, will transform virtually every area of the economy over the next several decades, and they all have one thing in common. They are built upon semiconductors. As these new technologies are deployed, they are driving growth and innovation across the semiconductor ecosystem. In terms of impact and scale, I believe AI will be the biggest technology inflection of our lifetimes. And at the heart of AI are some of the world's most sophisticated chips. In simple terms, the advanced chips that power AI datacenters are enabled by four key semiconductor technologies: leading-edge logic; compute memory or high-performance DRAM; DRAM stacking technology, referred to as high-bandwidth memory, or HBM; and advanced packaging to connect the logic and memory chips together and create a 'system in a package'. Applied has process technology leadership in all four of these areas, and we have made significant investments in next-generation solutions to make possible the key device architecture inflections that are essential for our customers' future roadmaps. In advanced logic, Applied has long-standing leadership in the materials engineering processes for both transistors and interconnects. The first nodes that use gate-all-around transistors are now transitioning to high-volume manufacturing. These new transistor process flows are considerably more complex, and the shift from FinFET to gate-all-around grows Applied's available market for the transistor module from around $6 billion to approximately $7 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. With the gate-all-around transition, we are also gaining share and we are on track to capture over 50% of the process equipment spending for transistor steps. We also have very strong market share in interconnect, or the wiring used to transmit data at high speed and low power. Our available market for the wiring steps is approximately $6 billion for each 100,000 wafer starts per month, and we expect it to grow by $1 billion when Backside Power Delivery is introduced into volume manufacturing. Overall, we expect to generate more than $2.5 billion of revenue from gate-all-around nodes this year and potentially more than double that in 2025. In DRAM, one of the key approaches that memory makers are using to improve performance and power consumption is to implement logic technologies in the peripheral circuitry. Our deep capabilities in logic, combined with our strong position in DRAM patterning and our unique, co-optimized hard mask solutions for capacitor scaling, makes us the clear leader in process equipment for DRAM today and best positioned for future growth. In the critical die-stacking technologies used in high-bandwidth memory, we also have strong leadership positions, including in micro-bump and through-silicon via. Last quarter, we said that we expected our HBM packaging revenue to be 4 times larger in 2024 than in 2023. As we have recently seen customers accelerate their capacity plans for HBM, we now believe that our revenue could be 6 times higher this year, growing to more than $600 million. Across all device types, we now expect revenue from our advanced packaging product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.7 billion this year. Looking further ahead, we see opportunities for this business to double again, as heterogenous integration is more widely adopted, beyond the AI datacenter, and we introduce new products that expand our served market. AI datacenter is just one example that illustrates how the major inflections that underpin the next generation of semiconductors are enabled by Applied Materials. Materials science and materials engineering are increasingly important to the industry's roadmap. Applied has invested early to develop a broad, unique, and connected portfolio of materials engineering solutions that are critical to enable major semiconductor inflections from AI high-performance computing to ICAPS edge computing. We are translating those investments into consistent outperformance. Recent TechInsights data confirms that in 2023 Applied grew faster than the wafer fab equipment market for the fifth year in a row. We accomplished this despite headwinds created by trade rules that we estimate restricted us from more than 10% of the China market during that period. While we have gained share overall, we are growing share within our served market even faster. This is important, because as logic devices become more three dimensional, future generations of DRAM come to market and advanced packaging becomes more prevalent, we expect materials engineering to become an even larger portion of overall wafer fab equipment. Another key component of Applied's strategy is to address the increasing complexity faced by the industry. First, we are driving earlier, deeper and broader collaboration with customers and partners. We are changing the industry's innovation model with the goal to accelerate mutual success rates and increase investment efficiencies. Our global EPIC platform, that we will build out over the next several years, is specifically designed to support high-velocity innovation and commercialization of next-generation technologies. Second, we are able to provide more complete and connected solutions that accelerate major device inflections. The portion of our revenue generated by integrated solutions has grown from approximately 20% in 2019 to 30% today. We expect demand for these fab-in-a-fab-type solutions to continue growing, both at the leading-edge and from our ICAPS customers who are serving specialty IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor applications. And third, we are helping customers transfer new technology into high-volume manufacturing faster and then optimize performance, yield, output and cost in their factory operations. This is supporting double-digit growth of our service business. AGS delivered a new record for revenue this quarter, $1.5 billion, with a significant portion of this coming from subscriptions in the form of long-term service agreements. Before I hand over to Brice, I will quickly summarize. Applied Materials continues to deliver strong performance in 2024 and we are in a great position to benefit from secular growth trends over the longer-term. Tectonic shifts in technology, including AI, IoT, EVs and clean energy, that are reshaping the global economy are built on semiconductors, driving demand for more chips and new chips with higher-performance and better energy-efficiency. Key device architecture inflections that underpin the semiconductor roadmap are enabled by Applied Materials. We expect this to support our ongoing outperformance as next-generation chip technologies, including gate-all-around logic nodes, high performance DRAM and HBM and Advanced Packaging, move into high-volume production. And finally, the increasingly complex industry roadmap is driving earlier, deeper and broader collaboration between Applied Materials and our customers and partners, accelerating demand for our most advanced co-optimized and integrated solutions and supporting double-digit growth in our service business. Now, I'll hand over to Brice.
Brice Hill: Thank you, Gary. And I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution, which resulted in another strong quarter for revenue and gross margin. Today, I'll discuss our overall business environment and share insights into our ICAPS business which serves the IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor markets. I'll describe our capital allocation strategy and operating model, demonstrating how we are driving profitable growth and attractive shareholder returns. I'll also summarize our Q2 results and provide our guidance for Q3. In calendar Q1, the global market for semiconductors grew 15% year-over-year and we are optimistic that the data center trends Gary outlined will help drive solid growth for the semiconductor industry. During the quarter, cloud service providers announced strong capital spending plans which is good news for our customers. In the market briefing we issued earlier this month, we forecast that the data center market will eventually become the number one driver of leading-edge foundry-logic wafer starts, surpassing PCs and then smartphones in the coming years. Within our business, we had a strong quarter in fiscal Q2 across DRAM, advanced packaging, ICAPS and services. In February, we projected that factory utilization would increase across all device types, and it did. Gary discussed how the data center AI megatrend is driving strong demand for our technologies used in leading-edge logic, DRAM, high-bandwidth memory and other forms of advanced packaging. Our ICAPS business is driven by three additional megatrends, notably IoT and edge computing, electric and autonomous vehicles and renewable energy. Across our ICAPS business, one of the largest demand drivers this year is edge computing, especially at the 28-nanometer node needed by smartphone companies and makers of IoT devices for industrial and home automation applications. A second large demand driver is power chips for electric vehicles where industry leaders are now establishing supply chains to support their long-term growth plans. A third driver is the power chips used to capture renewable solar and wind energy which are needed to achieve Net Zero goals in the decades ahead. We believe our ICAPS business will remain a large portion of our overall foundry-logic business for several reasons. One, the megatrends we described will continue to increase unit demand for ICAPS chips. Two, we are innovating at the device level which creates better chips, stimulates new system sales, and extends Applied's position as the highest-value partner for our customers. And finally, we are introducing ICAPS products in additional market segments which will help us broaden our reach and gain share. Next, I'll summarize our capital allocation strategy and the results it enables. Our efficient business model generates healthy free cash flow. Our first priority is investing in R&D and capital infrastructure to enable profitable growth. And our second priority is growing our dividend per share and using our buyback program to distribute excess free cash flow to shareholders. Specifically, over the past 10 fiscal years, we have reinvested more than $20 billion in R&D and over $5 billion in capital additions and distributed more than 90% of free cash flow to shareholders. Our capital allocation strategy supports our operating model, which I'll summarize. First, we invest over $3 billion in R&D each year collaborating closely with our customers to invent new semiconductor technologies that are critical to their competitive positions in the global megatrends we've described. Second, we design high-volume manufacturing systems that enable our customers to deploy these new chip and advanced packaging technologies at global scale. Third, we manage a global factory and supply chain network to manufacture these systems. Fourth, we service our systems which have decades of useful life helping customers maximize their return on investment by accelerating ramps and optimizing output, yield and cost. Fifth, we reinvest a high percentage of the profits from this activity back into R&D to develop more new technologies and solutions. And finally, we distribute excess cash to shareholders. An important point is that every tool we manufacture and ship grows our installed base and our service opportunity, which leads to consistent and stable growth for Applied Global Services. In fact, AGS has delivered 19 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth spanning two memory downcycles. Over 80% of AGS revenue comes from recurring services and parts sales, about two-thirds of which is delivered under long-term service agreements that have a 90% renewal rate. Connecting this to our capital allocation strategy, AGS has continued to produce more than enough operating profit to fully fund our growing dividend. In March 2023, we announced a 23% increase in our dividend per share, and in March of this year, we announced a 25% increase. In summary, over the past ten fiscal years, our operating model has increased company revenue at a compound rate of over 13%, non-GAAP EPS at nearly 30%, free cash flow at 33%, and dividends per share at nearly 12%. Also over this period, we reduced net shares outstanding by over 30%. Now I'll summarize our Q2 results. On a year-over-year basis, net sales grew slightly to nearly $6.65 billion, non-GAAP gross margin grew 70 basis points to 47.5%, non-GAAP OpEx grew 5% to $1.23 billion, and non-GAAP EPS grew 4.5% to $2.09. Turning to segment results, Semiconductor Systems revenue remained strong at $4.9 billion and included record ion implant sales. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 34.9%. Applied Global Services revenue increased 7% year-over-year to $1.53 billion, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28.5%. Our tools under subscription agreement increased by 8% year-over-year and our installed base of chambers surpassed 200,000 for the first time. Moving to Display, Q2 revenue was $179 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 2.8%. We are becoming more confident that the OLED technology found in smartphones will be adopted in notebook, PCs and tablets, whose larger screen sizes would spur an increase in capital investments. Turning to cash flows, in Q2, we generated nearly $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $1.14 billion in free cash flow. We distributed nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders, including $266 million in dividends and $820 million in buybacks. We repurchased 4.1 million shares at an average price of $197.77. Now, I'll share our guidance for Q3. We expect revenue of $6.65 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.01, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $4.8 billion, AGS revenue of about $1.57 billion, and Display revenue of around $245 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%, and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.26 billion. Finally, we are modeling a tax rate of 12.3%. Thank you, and now Mike, let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have another question, please re-queue, and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
CJ Muse: Yeah, thank you for taking the question. I guess we'd love for you to talk about your visibility today and how your ongoing conversations are going with your large customers as it pertains both to your outlook for kind of second half versus first half on a calendar basis, as well as building that potential backlog into calendar '25. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Okay, great. Hi, CJ. Thanks for the question. So, when we look at our business, and think about the largest customers as we look at Q3 and our guidance for Q3, we know that the DRAM shipments that we've had for China that we called out that were fairly high in Q1 and Q2 are falling off in the second half. And what we've been expecting is that ICAPS strength and leading-logic strength would backfill that drop-off in DRAM. And that's exactly what we see happening in Q3. And that's consistent on the leading-logic side with the advent of gate-all-around process technology and equipment beginning to ship earnest -- in earnest for the HVM ramp that will be upcoming, and I think that's a good indication of what we're expecting in the second half. We talked about whether leading-logic and ICAPS would be able to fill in for the drop-off in China DRAM, and that's exactly what we see in Q3. And then, when we look ahead to '25, we'll point to the same fundamental ramp for leading-logic. That will be gate-all-around. Gary highlighted in his remarks that we expected $2.5 billion of business related to gate-all-around shipments in '24. And we expect to be able to grow that significantly in '25 as that process technology ramps towards HVM, high-volume manufacturing.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please?
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Brice, I wanted to -- and Gary, I wanted to follow up on that sort of qualitative 2025 outlook. So, I guess, I heard you right, you said $2.5 billion gate-all-around this year, doubling next year or more. So, $2.5 billion of incremental year-over-year growth from gate-all-around, it sounds like you said the advanced packaging had the opportunity to double again over time, so that should be growing. HBM, theoretically, should be growing. ICAPS, I know has been a little weaker than it was. It feels like it's bottomed just given what we're seeing, that ought to grow. And I mean NAND flash is -- for you guys is pretty close to zero right now as well, so [indiscernible]. I mean, how do I think about like -- you've talked about over-delivering versus the market. Like let's say the WFE market was flat next year, given those drivers, how would I think about how you guys could grow relative to a market like that given those drivers?
Brice Hill: Yeah, thanks, Stacy, for the question. So, the way -- our perspective, we start with the longer-term view. And as Gary described, we're investing in the key inflections for the fastest-growing markets. And so, our perspective, if you stand back and think over many quarters or the next several years is that the leading-logic technologies like gate-all-around and backside power, the advanced packaging, HBM memory, our services business, we think all of those will grow faster than the average market and will help us gain share. And so, it's harder to call any particular quarter or a short time period in the near future, but that would be our perspective. And I think from a ICAPS perspective, you called out gate-all-around and ICAPS and DRAM and NAND, I think, thinking about all of them. We've talked about our DRAM share having improved over 10 percentage points over the last 10 years. And we expect that technology has great tailwinds. We talked about how HBM and utilization in DRAM is improving. So that's a positive. And if we think about ICAPS, the market, we have three quarters here that you can see, two -- our first two that are closed and our Q3 guidance, and ICAPS is very strong in those quarters and grows in Q3 to fill in some of that China DRAM business that drops off. And then finally, gate-all-around, the $2.5 billion that Gary highlighted, that's not just the incremental, that's our shipments for the entire business that are associated with gate-all-around that are shipping this year, and we do expect that to grow next year.
Gary Dickerson: Stacy, this is Gary. Really, the big focus for us is enabling and winning major device architecture inflections. So, when you break out all of these different device segments, certainly, foundry-logic leading-edge, the opportunity there for us to grow is significant because we have a very high share of those big inflections. The gate-all-around, backside power delivery, wiring is a real strength for us. As Brice mentioned, in DRAM, we gained 10 points of overall DRAM share over the last 10 years. And if I look forward at the architecture inflections in DRAM, we're even better positioned. Those will be much more materials-intensive, materials engineering-enabled, and that's going to be a really good position for us. We also talked about packaging. We've increased our view of packaging in '24 to $1.7 billion. But as I mentioned and Brice reiterated, we have an opportunity to double advanced packaging business. In HBM, that's -- we've increased that growth from 4x to 6x this year. And the last one is our services business, 19th consecutive quarters year-over-year, where we've seen growth. And with these highly complex architecture inflections, it gives us a really great opportunity to add more value with our services business. Also as people are moving into new locations where they don't have an experienced workforce, we've talked about double-digit growth in services right now. That's a $6 billion run rate, but that's adding significant growth as we go forward. So, there's just a few other thoughts.
Stacy Rasgon: But you said $2.5 billion this year from gate-all-around and more than double that in -- did I hear that wrong? Does that suggest $5 billion in gate-all-around in 2025?
Brice Hill: Yeah, that's what...
Stacy Rasgon: Or did I misunderstand what you said?
Gary Dickerson: No, I think that math is correct.
Brice Hill: Yeah, that's right, Stacy. So, that's not just the increment. That's the entire equipment sales that we'll have for that technology. So, $2.5 billion for this year and opportunity to double that next year.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Evercore ISI. Your question, please?
Mark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a question for Gary. Gary, when you talk about like investing more in materials engineering, it seems like you're kind of climbing up the value chain to the place where your -- it used to be your customers' domain. And a lot of times when you see companies moving up the value chain and adding more value, ultimately, you see that reflected in improving margins. So, appreciate that you engage in partnerships and that's the spirit. But like if you're adding more value, it seems like that ultimately, at the end of the day, should come back to you in the higher profitability. And I'm wondering if you could just talk philosophically about that. Like how -- is that something you would expect to see happen, or does that manifest in other ways? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mark. So, if you look at the industry overall, all of our customers are racing to be first to market to deliver those major device architecture inflections that determine their competitive position. So, gate-all-around, backside power, those new DRAM architectures and packaging is becoming more and more important to power performance and costs. So that is really what shapes the competitive landscape in the industry. And it's very, very clear, we're working with our customers for technology generations out into the future. So, we have very high visibility in -- this broad and connected portfolio that we have gives us an opportunity to engage with customers in those early and very deep relationships on those architecture inflections. And as we look forward, we do see materials engineering as a percentage of spend and the relative contribution increasing. And Applied has clear leadership, especially with this broad, connected portfolio. We built integration capability inside Applied that is really tremendous and really co-innovating with our customers as they're driving those architecture inflections. So, I do believe, for sure, that we will be creating more value in those relationships with our customers, and that certainly is valuable for them. And our focus is to capture more value as we're delivering more value with them. So, your basic question, I agree with your thoughts.
Mark Lipacis: Thanks. Very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please?
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Gary, maybe back to the gate-all-around. So, you're raising the forecast there by $1 billion. I think on, I think, HBM, you're raising it by another $100 million or so. Is that all going to show up in July and October? So, does it mean that conceptually, the second half of the year is over $1 billion higher than what you thought before? And then, on gate-all-around, what is driving such a significant growth versus what you thought before? $1 billion increase over $1.5 billion base is a very strong number. So, I'm just curious, what are the kind of the qualitative factors? And then just also quantitatively, does it mean that second half is $1 billion higher -- $1.1 billion higher than what you thought before?
Brice Hill: Hi, Vivek, it's Brice. I'll just do a clarification here. This quarter -- we decided last quarter when we talked about the incremental revenue for gate-all-around that it was a little bit confusing. So, we changed. And this quarter, we're talking about all of our revenue that's associated with the gate-all-around transistor and wiring. And so, that's not just the increment. So, the $2.5 billion that we're talking about this quarter is not supposed to be interpreted as an increase relative to the $1 billion we talked about last quarter. We're just changing the basis. Now, we're just quoting all of the business that's associated with the gate-all-around product. So, hopefully, that helps. So, as far as answering the question about what's driving the increase, I don't think our perspective has changed very much. It's $2.5 billion for this year. It can grow significantly next year as the technology ramps. And then, what I would say is you do see some of that in our Q3 guide. So, as you know, we took down -- or we're dropping off the incremental China DRAM shipments that we had. And in the second half, we're filling that in with ICAPS strength and growing leading-logic shipments that are driven by gate-all-around.
Vivek Arya: Brice, just a clarification...
Gary Dickerson: Vivek, I'd add, relative to kind of what drives the incremental spending, these technologies where you're improving device performance, the drive current, leakage, power consumption, all of those things, are incredibly difficult. And so, the customers -- and it's really all about this materials magic that we're able to provide with that broad portfolio of different types of technologies. So, step counts are increasing at every one of those different technology nodes as they are driving those roadmaps for performance, power to meet the -- especially for high-performance computing, AI computing demand type of applications. So again, those are very, very, very difficult technologies. Whether it's 100 billion transistors in a GPU or 100 kilometers of wiring in an applications processor, those are really amazing, amazing technology accomplishments with materials. That's what drives that incremental spending.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question, please?
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. The question is on advanced packaging, and you were pretty specific with what you're expecting this year. You spoke about the opportunity to double that again. You didn't provide a timeframe on that. So, if you could help us with some of the timeframe on when you expect to double that? And just in terms of what's driving that -- we know there's advanced packaging in logic and HBM, what's the mix of that in terms of what's driving the expectations higher?
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Chris. This is Gary. So, this whole focus around advanced packaging, heterogeneous integration is really a major drive across the entire industry. When you look at AI servers or any of these different kinds of applications, you see tremendous innovation in the high-bandwidth memory. You see tremendous innovation in how you're connecting together all of those high-performance logic chips and memory chips. And we really see the growth there being very, very significant, because it's so important to the industry's roadmap as kind of classic Moore's Law has slowed down significantly. This is another major driver of how the industry will innovate going forward. And with Applied, we have the broadest portfolio of technologies, PVD, CVD, CMP, plating, etch, we've added hybrid bonding, digital lithography, eBeam test. We have a very broad portfolio. And as we see those roadmaps -- and this is why I come back to architecture inflections are really what drives your incremental business going forward. So, we can see the roadmaps for our foundry-logic customers, for memory customers, all of them are investing very heavily in these types of technologies. And some of these areas also that are new innovations from Applied will help us drive that business 2 times higher, and I think that the compound annual growth rate keeps going up from there. The other advantage that we have besides this broad portfolio in the deep, multi-generation connection that we have with all of our customers is our full-flow packaging lab in Singapore. We're working with leading customers on those next-generation innovations, Chris. So, we have pretty good line of sight to what those inflections look like, the architecture inflections will look like in a very strong position to grow our share as those inflections come to market. We're not giving a specific timeframe on the doubling. It will happen over a number of years, but very, very optimistic about our opportunities in packaging.
Chris Caso: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please?
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Brice, I have a question on China. I think last quarter, you said you expect China to normalize to about 30% or so by the end of this year. So, my question is, is that still the expectation? And then, it looks like ICAPS is still holding up pretty well. So, is the decline primarily DRAM going forward? And I'm just curious as to given what we are hearing about what we're seeing in the end markets of ICAPS, I mean it looks like the broader analog is still relatively weak and auto is kind of mixed. I'm just curious as to what's driving the strength in ICAPS. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Srini. Yes, first of all, our mix, as we move to the second half of the year, will normalize with respect to China as a percent of our total revenue. So, it will be closer to 30% as expected. And it's the dynamic that you highlighted. We had some catch-up DRAM shipments to particular customers in China for the last three quarters. Those will fall off as we go through Q3 and Q4, and that really will bring our percentage of China revenue back down to -- closer to what's average over the last few years, which we'll call about 30%. And then, with respect to the mix of business, so as that DRAM business falls off, our ICAPS business and our leading-edge logic business does increase to fill that in. And so that's consistent with continued strength in ICAPS, which the rest of the market for us in China would be ICAPS-related. And I think you described it well. The end markets are mixed. So, industrial and auto have been weaker. Smartphone, PC-related products have been slow, but gaining some strength recently. And then, as we've talked about image sensors, power chips, microcontrollers, a lot of those markets have been stronger. So, it's been mixed end markets, but the customers are investing for forward-looking demand and to get capacity in place for forward-looking demand. And when we see utilization in those markets, we've seen it improve. So, I think when people ask us for guidance, hopefully, the best thing we can tell you is Q1 and Q2 were very strong in ICAPS and Q3 will be another strong quarter in the ICAPS market. Thanks for the question.
Srini Pajjuri: Thanks, Brice.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question, please?
Atif Malik: Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on gate-all-around as well. Very strong outlook, $2.5 billion, doubling to next year. Is the customer funnel for this demand pretty broad across the four foundries? And also, if you can rank order for us in the $2.5 billion, FPE, ALD patterning, like what's driving the most demand? Thank you.
Brice Hill: I think, I'll take the first part. I think that demand is across our customer base. So, it's not one single customer, but we won't share any details about the relative balance between customers. And then, from a device mix perspective, Gary -- or I'm sorry, equipment mix, I don't know if there's anything you would highlight there.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. I think again, one of the advantages that we have is this broad portfolio of technologies along with integrated tools and also our integration engineering where we're working with customers who are really co-innovating on these different technology inflections. So, if you look at gate-all-around, we have Epi, PVD, ALD, selective removal, etch, thermal processing, implant, CMP and eBeam. So, it's a very broad portfolio. And I'm not going to break out all of those different pieces. But what I would say is our ability to connect that portfolio together is really a tremendous strength in our ability to co-optimize as you're thinking about -- and we've done this back in FinFET also, where we were able to co-optimize and innovate in how you're building those structures so that you can improve power and performance. And we're doing the same thing with gate-all-around.
Operator: Does that answer your question?
Atif Malik: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two quick ones, one on HBM and the other one on NAND. So, in HBM, your customers would tell us that they're sold out, certainly for '24. For the most part, they're sold out for '25 as well. So, my guess is you've got pretty good visibility into next year. Gary, you talked about overall advanced packaging doubling over the medium to long term. But when you zoom into HBM, could that business for you multiply again in '25 on a year-over-year basis? And then, on the NAND side, the business continues to be pretty depressed. Your customers, their profitability is improving, cash flow is improving or becoming less bad. Are you starting to see purchase orders from your customers come back? Or what do they need to see for them to spend on WFE again? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Toshiya, it's Brice. I'll start, and then Gary may add something on the HBM. So, on the sold out comment, what we do -- we have seen utilizations improve across the DRAM wafer starts. We've seen the allocation to HBM from a wafer start perspective increase from 5% to probably something closer to 20%. That said, it's not 100% utilized. So, you could speculate what the -- if there's some restraints, it could be in the packaging side, and we have seen orders for HBM going up. So, we'll have to let you think about that and talk to those vendors from that perspective. On the NAND side, our perspective on NAND is that Moore's Law is still very much alive in NAND. The bit density is increasing with each generation of NAND fairly aggressively. And it's meeting the demand function for increased bits. And what that really means is that the business we see in NAND is for technology upgrades, more technology upgrades not really new wafer starts. So, that's what we expect to see as we move forward. And overall, we expect NAND to grow at the speed of semiconductors. It's -- obviously, storage has a very important part, and several of the vendors called out how important storage is even for AI and that it will grow. So, I think for us, it's been slow, but we expect it to grow over time and memory in total to be about a third of our sales for WFE. And then, Gary, back to you whether anything specific on HBM...
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Really -- hi, Toshiya. Nothing really too much more beyond what Brice was talking about. And we have seen demand for HBM strengthening. We went from about 4x increase to 6x increase from the last time that we talked to you guys. And I would say that we still are seeing incremental demand going forward. So that pull is still there from customers. We're not giving any point estimate for next year, but we do continue to see stronger demand in that segment.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please?
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Gary, I had a question on backside power delivery. It seems that the industry has two approaches to it. One is the backside wiring with direct contact with the transistors, and another one is the [nano-TFE] (ph) approach. I'm kind of curious, you've spoken about the 100 -- incremental $1 billion SAM for 100,000 wafer starts per month. How does it split between those two approaches? And also, can you quantify what kind of revenues you expect this year and next year for Applied in backside power delivery? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Hi. Krish. Yeah, I don't want to talk too much about the specific architectures that customers are using. That's confidential for all of those different customers. I would say that going forward, that direct connect to the backside is the path that everybody is focused on. So, I think over time, that will grow a fairly significant amount -- well, both of those approaches will grow a fairly significant amount. And we're deeply engaged with customers on that inflection. We're leading in wiring overall. We have a very, very high share of wiring. And so, wiring going to the backside, we've said that, that gives us an opportunity of 50% of that spend when that inflection happens. So, we're supporting both of those different types of approaches for the backside, but I don't want to get too specific in terms of which one do we see bigger. Over time, I think that it could move to the direct connect. But that timing, I don't want to give specifically because that's going to be each one of different customers' roadmaps. Relative to timing for revenue, it's pretty small for us right now in 2024. It will grow in '25, but the ramp -- significant ramp for backside power is still out beyond '25 in revenue.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Gary. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. Your question, please?
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Brice, I have two-part question on China DRAM. And the first part is, you talked about it coming down [$500 million] (ph). Is that stepping all the way down in fiscal Q3? So, what's the assumed step-down in China DRAM for fiscal Q3? And then, more broadly, of the $1.6 billion worth of DRAM business, I'm wondering if you can kind of help us figure out how much of that is China. If I look at Korea and I look at how much that is, it looks like about $1 billion of the $1.6 billion DRAM revenue is China. Can you confirm whether that's in the right ballpark? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Hi, Tim, thanks for the question. The only quantification that I gave in prior quarters was that our DRAM as a whole was up more than $500 million in the quarters where we had that incremental. So, I think I'll just leave it at that and say it's more than $500 million in each of the last three quarters. And as we look into the second half, it doesn't drop completely to zero in Q3, but it drops significantly and then it's pretty close to zero in Q4. And our mix to China revenue for the company, as I highlighted to an earlier question, will be about -- in the range of 30%, which is normal for us. So, I think that's as close as I can get on that. Thanks for the question.
Timothy Arcuri: Sure, Brice. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please?
Joe Quatrochi: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to kind of try to understand just the trends that you're seeing in ICAPS. Can you help us just understand the difference in the growth that you're seeing from China versus non-China? Because it sounds like as we look at China revenue normalizing, the DRAM falling off, obviously, the rest of that is mostly just ICAPS. So, can you help us just kind of understand the trends between China and non-China?
Brice Hill: Hi, Joe, thanks for the question. Yeah, for China, what I would say is the last three quarters have been very strong. So, if we're speculating about a slowdown or a digestion period, one of the reasons I didn't reemphasize that is we're kind of going by what we're seeing. So, we had two strong quarters, Q1, Q2. Our Q3 guide again has strength in ICAPS and a strong fourth quarter for China. When we think about the world right now, I think we have three regions growing and the rest of the regions not growing. So that corresponds with the end markets sort of being mixed at this point. Our view of China overall, the team showed a pie chart of the different device elements of WFE last year. ICAPS was about 40% of WFE by that pie chart on May 2 that was put out. China is our largest market in ICAPS, and we monitor that carefully. We've got about -- we've got a large number of customers. We're tracking about 30 different -- more than 30 factory projects that are in ramp process. In other words, they have capacity, they're adding capacity, they're ramping. We're tracking utilizations. Utilizations are improving. We understand yields are improving. So, we think that the China market will be very large and important market for us going forward. We said we don't see a cliff for that market, and I think we'd stick by all those remarks at this point.
Joe Quatrochi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please?
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As we transition from a more mature specialty ICAPS-driven growth profile to a leading edge, sort of advanced foundry-logic memory spending profile this year and going forward, this typically tends to be a strong tailwind for your process control and diagnostics portfolio, which leans very heavily on your most advanced tools and solutions, right? Because [picture] (ph) sizes get smaller, so better resolution required, but also new and more [defecting yield] (ph) challenges, right? So, it's probably a driver of your leading-edge CFE-driven eBeam portfolio this year. Are you guys still seeing that portfolio grow like 4x this year? And how does the pipeline look for next year? And maybe mid to longer term, like given the significant manufacturability challenges, does the Applied team see process control and diagnostics intensity rising faster than overall WFE intensity over the next few years?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Harlan. This is Gary. So, I would say that for sure, the connection that we have with our eBeam technology and these major architecture inflections is a real advantage for us, because, again, it's a race on who gets there first relative to those major architecture inflections and learning rate, how fast you learn is one of the determining factors. So, having this unique capability is a real advantage for Applied. I mean, obviously, it's a good growth driver for us from a revenue perspective, but that synergy with the rest of our broad portfolio, our connected portfolio, is a real advantage. On coalfield emission, which is really one of the key technologies in the electron optics, it gives us the highest resolution at up to 10 times higher imaging speeds. So, it really is highly differentiated. And we are still on track this year to grow our CFE systems revenue around 4x in '24, and that would represent about 50% of our total eBeam system sales. And then, when I look forward, again, I see PDC as a really great growth driver for Applied. We've had the strongest pipeline of new products than we've ever had. And the synergy with the rest of our process equipment business, all of that materials magic, materials innovation is increasing. So again, very, very optimistic about the shape of that business.
Harlan Sur: Thank you, Gary.
Michael Sullivan: Yeah, thanks, Harlan. And operator, we have time for just one more quick question please.
Operator: Certainly. One moment for our final question. And our final question for today comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your question, please?
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for letting me ask the question. Gary, you were talking about this inflection point technology leading-edge logic, HBM, DRAM and advanced packaging, but would it be fair to say that what is not in your backlog is the additional wafer capacity, especially for gate-all-around and memory, and that would be something that would be coming in, the [POS] (ph) be placed later this year for shipment in 2025?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Hi, Mehdi, it's Brice. I guess I'll take that one. We do expect -- I can't tell if it's a greenfield question or not, but we do expect increased wafer starts across definitely ICAPS, definitely leading logic, a smaller amount in DRAM. And probably the place where we don't really expect increased wafer starts is in NAND, but that will still be upgrades. So, most of the memory technologies are upgrades. But it will be a combination of new technologies and new plant and equipment across the board.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Mehdi, for your question. And now, Brice, would you like to give us your closing thoughts?
Brice Hill: Thanks, Mike. I think we've done a good job anticipating the roadmap inflections in datacenter AI. We can see the pull for our solutions in gate-all-around chips, from transistors to frontside wiring and backside wiring and in advanced packaging. Same goes for DRAM, where we're number one in materials engineering and especially strong in HBM stacking. In future calls, we'll have a lot more to say about our positions in edge, AI and IoT plus automotive and clean energy, which are very big and long-term drivers of our ICAPS business. The momentum in our systems business fuels our service business, which is driving very stable subscription-like growth and helping us increase the dividend at an accelerated rate. Gary will be at the Bernstein Conference in New York on May 30, and I hope to see many of you at the BofA conference in San Francisco on June 6. Thank you, Mike. Let's close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Brice. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of today's call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-02-15 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied’s First Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that today’s call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied’s most recent Form 10-K filing with the SEC. Today’s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today’s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On Monday evening, February 26, Applied will host a panel at the SPIE Advanced Lithography and Patterning Conference in San Jose. Joining us will be leading experts from NVIDIA, Intel, imec and Siemens EDA. We’ll also have demo stations with several new products and technologies, we’ll be introducing at the event. There won’t be a webcast, so we hope you’ll join us in San Jose. And with that introduction, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. Applied Materials made a strong start to fiscal 2024 with first quarter revenue in the high end of our guidance and earnings that exceeded our guided range. Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is delivering results. We have outperformed our markets for five consecutive years and believe we are in a great position as customers transition major new chip innovations to high-volume production over the next several years. The breadth of our technology capabilities, combined with our deep customer relationships, allows us to see inflections early and accelerate key technology innovations that are critical to scaling AI, IoT, electric vehicles and renewable energy. We have reshaped and expanded our portfolio of solutions that enable next-generation transistors, new interconnect schemes, including backside power delivery, high-performance DRAM including high bandwidth memory, and specialty applications in the ICAPS market. In my prepared remarks today, I’ll provide some examples of how these inflections grow Applied’s available market and are highly accretive to our share. I’ll also talk about our long-term strategy to accelerate innovation and commercialization velocity through tighter collaboration with our customers and partners. But to begin, let me share our latest perspective on the market environment. In our discussions with customers, we’re hearing that overall market dynamics are improving. There is a reacceleration of capital investment by cloud companies, fab utilization is increasing across all device types and memory inventory levels are normalizing. In terms of Applied’s business in 2024, we see leading-edge foundry-logic being stronger year-over-year, even though some important projects are delayed. We’re forecasting ICAPS demand to be slightly lower than 2023 with weakness in some end markets being offset by strong regional investments. We expect our NAND revenues to be up year-on-year, but NAND to remain less than 10% of total wafer fab equipment spending. And we see continued strength in our DRAM business, driven by customers ramping production of high-bandwidth memory. High-bandwidth memory where high-performance DRAM dies are stacked and connected to logic die with advanced packaging is a key enabler for the AI data center. The dies used in high-bandwidth memory are more than two times larger than standard DRAM, which means that more than twice the capacity is needed to produce the same volume of chips. On top of this, the packaging steps needed for die stacking further increase our total available market. High-bandwidth memory, or HBM, made up only about 5% of DRAM output in 2023, but is expected to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate over the coming years. DRAM is a great example of how our inflection-focused innovation approach is working, by focusing on the critically enabling process and packaging steps for next-generation technologies, Applied has significantly increased our share of the DRAM market. In 2023, we estimate that our DRAM share was more than 10 points higher than it was a decade earlier. And our DRAM revenues were larger than our two closest process equipment peers combined. We’re also best positioned for future growth, thanks to our leadership in logic technologies that have been implemented for DRAM peripheral circuitry applications to enable significantly increased IO speeds. Our strong position in DRAM patterning, our unique co-optimized hard mask solutions, which are critical for capacitor scaling and advanced packaging, where we have strong leadership positions in Micro-bump and Through-Silicon Vias that will enable multiple generations of high-bandwidth memory. In fiscal 2024, we expect our HBM packaging revenues to be four times larger than last year, growing to almost $0.5 billion. And across all device types, we expect revenue from our advanced packaging product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.5 billion. Looking further ahead, we see opportunities for this business to double again, as heterogeneous integration is more widely adopted, and we introduced new products that expand our served market. Another key inflection that will transition to high-volume production beginning this year is gate-all-around transistors in leading-edge foundry-logic. These complex 3D structures can provide a more than 30% improvement in a chip’s energy efficiency. This is especially enabling for high-performance AI data center applications. The shift from FinFET to gate-all-around grows Applied’s available market by $1 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. And we’re on track to gain share and capture over 50% of the spending for the process equipment used in this new transistor module. Major advances in leading-edge foundry-logic and DRAM are also driving the need for more and better metrology and inspection to be integrated into the manufacturing flow. We have developed industry-leading cold field emission eBeam technology that enables highly sensitive 2D and 3D imaging at up to ten times higher speeds. We expect our CFE systems revenue to grow by a factor of 4 in 2024 and represent 50% of our total eBeam system sales. The incredible innovation we see in the industry today is not limited to the leading edge. In recent years, ICAPS customers have invested about 10% of their revenues or about $30 billion annually in research and development to accelerate the roadmap for IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensor technologies. ICAPS technology depends less on shrinking device features and customer investments are heavily weighted towards new structures, new materials and new integration approaches, playing to the core strengths of Applied. ICAPS is another area where we saw market inflections early. And five years ago, we formed a dedicated team to focus on the needs of these customers. Since then, we’ve released more than 20 new ICAPS products that target the highest value device innovations in these markets and we have a robust development pipeline of unit process and integrated solutions. While major end market inflections, such as AI and IoT, electric vehicles and renewable energy are already driving semiconductor growth and innovation, it’s important to recognize they are still in the early stages of adoption. For example, high-performance GPUs for AI data centers only represent 6% of leading-edge foundry-logic wafer starts today. The full potential of technologies like AI cannot be unlocked without next-generation chips with better performance, power and cost. The technology roadmap for semiconductors is rich with possibilities and opportunities, but also incredibly complex. No company is better placed to address this complexity than Applied Materials. With the industry’s broadest and deepest portfolio of capabilities and products, we have a unique ability to combine, co-optimize and integrate our technologies to develop highly differentiated solutions for our customers. To bring these advances to market faster, we’re also innovating the way we innovate, by driving earlier and deeper collaboration with our customers and partners. We are expanding our global innovation network that will connect into the EPIC center we’re building in Silicon Valley. During the quarter, we announced an expansion of our long-term partnership with Leti, which is focused on accelerating ICAPS innovation, and we launched a new collaboration with MIT, which is centered around next-generation power electronics. As industry complexity rises, we’re also delivering more value to customers with our advanced services that enable our customers to accelerate R&D, transfer new technology into volume manufacturing faster and then optimize yield, output and cost in their factories. AGS has delivered 18 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. Revenue for the first quarter was up 8% versus the same period last year, and the business is now at a $6 billion annual run rate. AGS has the opportunity for double-digit growth this year, and we believe we can sustain this growth rate into the future. A significant portion of AGS revenue is generated from subscriptions. We have almost 17,000 tools under service agreements, up 8% year-on-year, and these agreements have a very high renewal rate over 90%. Before I pass the call over to Brice, I will quickly summarize. Applied Materials outperformed our markets in 2023 for the fifth consecutive year and we delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2024. The positions we’ve established at key industry inflections, will support continued outperformance, as customers ramp next-generation chip technologies into high-volume production. We are strengthening R&D collaboration with customers and partners to drive innovation and commercialization velocity, improvements in mutual success rate and R&D investment efficiencies. And we see growing demand for our advanced services that are helping customers manage increasing complexity in their business as the industry scales. Now I’ll hand over to Brice.
Brice Hill: Thank you, Gary. And I’d like to thank our teams for delivering strong revenue and margins this quarter and making further improvements in our operating performance. On today’s call, I’ll discuss our value creation strategy and the results it is producing, then I’ll summarize our growth thesis and why we believe we will outperform our markets in the years ahead, finally, I’ll summarize our Q1 results and provide our guidance for Q2. I’ll begin by discussing how our assets and strategy create value for shareholders. Applied has the broadest and deepest process equipment portfolio and expertise in the industry. We are highly invested in collaborating with our customers, allocating $3 billion in annual R&D to invent new solutions to the most critical Semiconductor manufacturing challenges. Increasingly, the only way to solve these challenges is by co-optimizing and integrating our chamber technologies in new ways. In addition, identifying new materials and processes early and collaborating closely with customers, leads to faster results, a higher probability of success, greater efficiency and stronger financial returns. The benefits of our value creation strategy are being demonstrated in our financial results. We generated record equipment sales, $20.7 billion in calendar 2023, including legacy equipment reported in AGS. And we extended our strong position in DRAM with record calendar year sales of over $4.3 billion. In fact, over the past ten years, the company has gained over 10 points of DRAM share in multiple points of overall share. This has contributed to Applied delivering a fifth straight year of overall WFE share gains and one of the best share outcomes of the past 20 years. Over the same ten fiscal years, we’ve grown company revenue at a compound rate of over 13%, non-GAAP EPS at nearly 30%, free cash flow at 33% and dividends per share at nearly 12%. Also, over this period, we increased return on invested capital from 8% to 35% and reduced net shares outstanding by over 30%. Next, I will summarize our growth thesis. As we look out over the planning horizon, we expect semiconductors to grow significantly faster than GDP. Second, we expect the equipment market to grow as fast or faster than semiconductors over time, driven by increasing technical complexity. Third, we expect Applied’s equipment business to outgrow the market. And fourth, we expect our services business to grow as fast or faster than our equipment business. I’ll take a moment to support the third pillar of our thesis that Applied’s equipment business will outgrow the market. The reason is that our technologies enable the key semiconductor advances needed to drive growth in AI, IoT and renewable energy. Looking ahead to the semiconductor process inflections that will play out over the next several years, the company is extremely well positioned. In data center AI, we are number one in process equipment for advanced logic and compute memory, both standard DRAM and high-bandwidth memory. We also have line of sight to share a 50% or more in gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery and advanced packaging. We are equally strong in edge AI and IoT with the number one position in ICAPS silicon, which is used to sense and convert analog information and transmit it to the cloud. We are also innovating rapidly in ICAPS technology for the global energy transformation, including through new agreements with partners like Leti and MIT, which Gary described. In summary, we feel confident that our unique assets and collaboration strategy position Applied to continue to outpace our markets and deliver strong shareholder returns as these major inflections play out over the next several years. Now I’ll summarize our Q1 results. On a year-over-year basis, net sales declined slightly to $6.7 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 110 basis points to 47.9%, non-GAAP OpEx grew 5.6% to $1.23 billion, and non-GAAP EPS grew nearly 5% to $2.13. Turning to our segment results, Semiconductor Systems revenue was strong at $4.91 billion and included record DRAM and edge system sales. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 35.7%. While our operating expenses are primarily focused on R&D programs for emerging technology inflections, we are also investing to expand and diversify our manufacturing logistics and supply chain to efficiently serve future growth. Applied Global Services delivered record revenue and its 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. AGS revenue increased approximately 8% year-over-year to nearly $1.8 billion and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28.3%. Our installed base surpassed 49,000 tools, during the quarter and grew to nearly 200,000 chambers. Around two thirds of AGS recurring services and parts revenue was delivered as subscription agreements. Finally, AGS continued to produce more than enough operating profit to fund Applied’s growing dividend. Moving to Display, Q1 revenue was $244 million, and segment non-GAAP operating profit was 10.2%. We continue to look forward to our opportunity in the upcoming OLED IT growth inflection. Turning to cash flows in Q1, we generated $2.3 billion in operating cash flow and $2.1 billion in free cash flow. We distributed $966 million to shareholders, including $266 million in dividends and $700 million in buybacks. We repurchased nearly five million shares, at an average price of $152.60. Please note that our Q1 results include the following. First, as we discussed in our recent 10-K report, we increased the estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment and this increased non-GAAP EPS by $0.03. Also effective Q1, we refined the way we allocate stock-based compensation, moving the majority of the expenses from corporate unallocated to the operating segments, which gives managers greater visibility over costs. While the change has no impact on company operating profit or EPS, it reduced the segment operating profit and corporate unallocated costs proportionately. To help you with your segment models, our quarterly earnings presentation includes a table showing what operating profits would have been in fiscal 2022 and in each quarter of fiscal 2023 on a like basis. Finally, the reduction in depreciation and share-based compensation, in cost of sales, increased gross margin by approximately 40 basis points. Now I will share our guidance for Q2. We expect revenue to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.97, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $4.8 billion, AGS revenue of about $1.5 billion and Display revenue of around $150 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47.3% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.235 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 12.5%. Thank you. And now, Mike, let’s begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. Our goal is to help as many of our analysts as possible. With that in mind, please ask just one question on today’s call. If you have another question, please re-queue and we’ll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let’s please begin.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about DRAM in China. So DRAM was very strong. It was supposed to be strong, but it was quite a bit stronger than, I think, we had thought it was going to be. I guess, can you tell us how much of that was China versus non-China? And going forward, last quarter, you had talked about the expectations for the China piece of that that had been pulled forward due to the sanctions to roll off as we went through the rest of the year. What are your thoughts on that China trajectory, as we go into April quarter and into the second half?
Brice Hill: Hi Stacy, thanks for your question. So in the current – in the quarter we just closed, we did see high shipments of China DRAM. And it was approximately the same in terms of the higher quantity as we saw in Q4. And just to be clear, we will expect another quarter in Q2, in our outlook quarter that it should remain elevated. I think for the Q4, we had said it was approximately $500 million increase on the DRAM side, that’s probably a good estimate for all of those quarters. And then the second part of the question, as we look through the rest of the year, we’ll expect that to normalize. Our China mix should normalize from the levels it’s at right now to something that’s more typical with our average.
Stacy Rasgon: Which is what? Is that – what’s the typical?
Brice Hill: Well, I would say from a long term – from a many year perspective, we averaged approximately 30%. So if we’re at 45% right now will decline across the year to somewhere around that level.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That’s helpful guys, thank you.
Brice Hill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question please?
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping if you could give us your view on how you see the WFE environment in 2024. I think many of your competitors have suggested kind of a low to mid-single-digit growth. But within that, the move towards more leading edge and DRAM and less on the trailing edge, but just given how strongly Applied grew in some of your trailing-edge and ICAPS, how does that position you in this new WFE environment? Because I think, Gary, you said that you only see only limited decline on the ICAPS side. But when I look at the CapEx of many of the auto industrial or analog companies in the U.S., they are cutting it quite sharply. So that’s why I was curious why you think that it’s only going to decline? So just broadly comment on WFE and the different piece parts and then maybe China versus non-China kind of cutting of that. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Vivek. No real change, I think, in our outlook for 2024, in terms of shaping how those end markets are evolving. So, we do think DRAM will continue to be a strong market. We think NAND will improve from its low levels a little bit. We think leading logic will be larger as gate-all-around and new investments start to ramp towards the back half of the year. And we do think there will be some digestion in ICAPS in China, both. Just to be crystal clear, we had enormous growth for two years in ICAPS and the China-related ICAPS business. And so we won’t see that enormous growth this year. It may be a little bit smaller. We think there’s some digestion with that capacity. But we expect that market to grow over time along with the underlying rates for the company. So that’s – those – the shape of those end markets hasn’t changed in our outlook.
Vivek Arya: So is that consistent with the low-to-mid single-digit WFE, that others are suggesting? Or do you have a different view?
Brice Hill: Well, all we can do is tell you what we see from Applied’s perspective. When we commented on 2023, we said it was a strong year for Applied. And to the way you asked your question, we had strong ICAPS. We had strong DRAM; we were strong in growth in packaging. And so as we look toward 2024, those are the puts and takes. We’re not going to give a precise number for 2024.
Vivek Arya: Thank you, Brice.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.
CJ Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess given the strong outperformance that you showed in 2023, where your silicon business actually grew where I think most people are thinking WFE down in the high single digits. Curious how you’re thinking about 2024? You’ve talked about, clearly, you’re benefiting from share gains across leading-edge foundry-logic and DRAM. But also a vision for ICAPS slowing. So do you think it’s another year of outperformance? Or is it a year of digestion, if you could kind of walk through that? And just as a kind of a bonus question, with SPY [ph] just a little over a week away, would you care to give a preview of what we’ll hear, including a focus on Sculpta? Thanks so much.
Brice Hill: Okay. So I’ll tackle the first part, and then I know Gary wants to tackle the second part of the question. So on outperforming in 2024, CJ, we do expect, because of our exposure to the fast-growing markets and some of the inflections growing quickly in 2024. We do expect to outperform. We’re not making a call on the size of the market. It’s like you said, there’s a couple of markets that are growing, the ICAPS market and the China piece, we think won’t grow. And so we’re not making a call on which is the stronger trend. And I don’t know if we know. So we’ll see how the year plays out from that perspective. And Gary, on the show.
Gary Dickerson: Hi CJ. On – just let me start on the outperformance. I think the most important thing to think about is, how we’re positioned for major inflections. So if you think about foundry-logic leading edge, gate all around, backside power distribution, those are incremental billion-dollar opportunities for Applied, where we have an opportunity for more than 50% share, which is very accretive to our overall market share. So we’re really well positioned there. ICAPS, we formed that group five years ago, as I said earlier, 20 major new products have been introduced. We have a strong pipeline of future ICAPS products. And so again, they’re – and we have opportunities to grow in segments like edge and PDC, where we have a lot of momentum. So, I like our position in ICAPS. DRAM, we’ve gained more than 10 points of share over the last 10 years. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, extremely well positioned for the major inflections in DRAM. In packaging, we have the strongest and broadest portfolio. And this is around $1.5 billion of revenue for us in 2024 and an opportunity to double over the next few years. So all of those areas, I think, really set us up for continued outperformance. And then on your question about SPIE, one of the things we’ll be talking about there is Sculpta, just reminding people, that’s a breakthrough pattern shaping technology that provides a simpler, faster and more cost-effective alternative to EUV double patterning. So, we’re engaged with all of the leading foundry-logic customers and expanding Sculpta steps for advanced patterning, including High-NA EUV, and we’re also working with customers on new Sculpta applications. And we expect this business to grow to close to $200 million in 2024, in ramp to around $0.5 billion in annual revenue, in the next few years. Also at SPIE, for those of you that will attend, you’ll hear about new edge and CVD technology for patterning that will be very large growth drivers for the company and enable us to continue to outperform. And just for reference, in patterning, we’ve increased our served market from around $1.5 billion, 10 years ago, to $8 billion now and our share from around 10% to 30%. So when Brice said, I was excited, I am absolutely excited these are some really, really great technologies with very strong customer pull and delivering meaningful growth for the company.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question please.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you, good afternoon. I guess the question is kind of looking at the order rates and more importantly, what your customers are telling you as you’re looking into calendar 2025. As you know, some others in the industry with long lead times have started to see some of those green shoots coming into 2025. I know that we’re balancing here between some of your customers burning off capacity and going through technology transitions. What’s the thought as we start to look into 2025, at these early days?
Brice Hill: Hi Chris, thanks for the question. When we look at the market currently, we’re seeing improvements in inventories, and we’re seeing improvements in utilization. So it’s starting to pick up. That’s pretty much across – that is across the entire market on the utilization side. And then what we’re hearing from customers is optimism, generally speaking, for 2025. We would echo comments we’ve heard from others that the semiconductor end market for devices is expected to be growing. And it’s an investment cycle on the leading edge. We’re expecting the memory markets to continue to improve. So 2025, we are optimistic about the direction for 2025.
Chris Caso: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question please.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Garry, I had a question for you. You have a broad-based product portfolio. You outperformed WFE last two years. I’m kind of curious for some of these new applications, whether it’s HBM, gate-all-around or even backside power delivery, are customers looking at a one-stop shop? Or more going with best-of-breed solutions? And in other words, let’s say, for gate-all-around, is your strength in Epi helping your edge or ALD products?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Chris, one thing I would say that for all of these inflections, it’s a tremendous advantage for us to have that broad portfolio. Again, when you think about – one of the examples I’ve used many times is, your processor chip and your smartphone with 15 billion transistors and 60 miles of wiring, which is kind of mind-boggling, when you think about how do we do that? How do we create something like that. There are over 1,500 steps in building that type of chip. And when you’re developing these new technologies, like gate-all-around, like backside power or new DRAM technologies or any of these packaging technologies, the ability to combine and co-optimize these steps is an enormous advantage, enormous that 60 miles of wiring, we have one platform that combines seven technologies under vacuum, to enable that those 60 miles long, very thin wires to move the data at super high speeds, very low resistance and very low power. So it’s completely unique. And that’s about one-third of our portfolio are those integrated solutions. We also have clear leadership in eBeam technology. I talked about our cold field emission electron optics. And that enables us to see those structures, when you’re building gate-all-around, and you want to look at the width of those nanosheets, again, we have unique technology that enables us to learn faster and then we can co-optimize all of those technologies. So as we’re driving our innovation with customers, we’re deeper, we’re earlier, we can see four generations out, relative to those technologies. So super, super deep connectivity. That’s why also I think EPIC is going to be a game changer in how we innovate, the way we innovate. We talked about the relationship with Larry [ph] for innovation and edge computing and ICAPs, all of those things, then we have our advanced packaging lab in Singapore that is also a full flow lab, where customers are working on innovation and new architectures. So Chris, I think that gives us a tremendous advantage. We can see what’s needed earlier. And then the ability to co-optimize all of that gives us a tremendous advantage.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question please.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I have a question for Brice. Brice, you talked about China mix normalizing from 45% to 30%. Can you talk about the impact of the mix on the gross margin from the 47.3% you’re guiding through for the rest of the year?
Brice Hill: Thanks, Atif. Appreciate the question. So yes, our gross margin reported in Q1 was 47.9%. We think that we’ve modeled what it would be without the higher China mix, and our view is the underlying gross margin is approximately 46.7% at this point. So as we go through the course of the year, we expect that gross margin to come down from 47.9%, to a more normal amount. At the same time, where we are underneath that, the 46.7% will continue to improve slowly, if that makes sense. So, if you normalize Q1 immediately, you’d be at 46.7%. We expect that to improve through the course of the year. And then we’re not changing our goals. Our goal is 48% to 48.5% for 2025. That’s still where we’re targeting as we work on pricing improvements and continue to work on our cost road map.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Atif, I would just add that we have made progress pretty much across all customers on pricing improvements. I think we’ve talked before about cost headwinds that we encountered in the supply chain. We’re making improvements there, and as Brice said, we’re committed to hit those goals.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi guys. Gary, I have a question on your HBM comment. I think you said HBM accounted for about 5% of industry output. If you can clarify if that’s wafer output or if that bids, but my question is, as we look out to the next few years I think you’re forecasting about 50% growth for this business. So, it’s a little tricky to understand for us as to how much of DRAM WFE is going to HBM right now? And how do you see that evolving? I mean if the market grows 50%, should we expect I guess the equipment spending also to grow 50%? Or do you think it’s going to grow faster than that?
Brice Hill: Hi Srini, since I’ve seen a lot of the modeling, I’ll just share a couple of those data points. So on the first question, its wafer starts when we think about the 5%, its wafer starts. I think it is difficult to estimate the equipment purchases at this point because you probably understand that the DRAM business itself has been underloaded as most of the markets have. So I think what many of the customers are doing is shifting some of their capacity to HBM, to get this output. Gary highlighted in his prepared remarks that the dye sizes for the are larger than the non-HBM. So it certainly will help drive up utilization, which will eventually increase equipment orders going forward. And we do think the DRAM business, if you look at the past few years, the level of WFE for DRAM, we do think that – it’s been fairly strong, and it will continue to be strong is our expectation. And then the last piece, of course, is customers are having to expand the HBM related apps of their DRAM process. Gary highlighted what that is for us, and that’s growing a lot faster than what you see on the general Equipment side. So my understanding of the DRAM is about 700 steps in a DRAM process and about 15 additional steps, possibly 20 to do the HBM level of that. So for sure, you’ll see customers growing the HBM packaging techniques and capabilities alongside the regular capacity. And then we’ll expect to see utilization increase as time goes on.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had a two-part question. The first one is on the conventional DRAM part of your business. And the second part is on the NAND business. So the bullishness in terms of HBM, we understand. I’m hoping to better understand what your customers are doing, what they’re telling you, Gary, in terms of their plans on the conventional DRAM side are things still very muted? And are they disciplined from a supply perspective? Or are you seeing a pickup in your conventional DRAM business, as well to the extent you have visibility there? And then I guess a similar question on the NAND side. It’s been a soft market for everyone. I guess there’s hope that at least node transitions or layer count increases will resume this year. Are you starting to see early signs of a pickup? Or are things pretty soft there? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yes. Toshiya, its Brice. I’ll just make a couple of comments and maybe Gary will add to that. So, on the DRAM side, and this is true for DRAM and NAND, but I’ll start with DRAM. We do see utilization improving, and we also see improvements in prices, and we also see improvements in inventory positions. So we do think that’s consistent with the rising optimism on the DRAM side. The utilizations have been low enough that there’s a ways to go before they have to start thinking about adding capacity. So our view on the market is it’s mostly from a WFE perspective, the nodal upgrades and the HBM that we talked about. And it would be similar for NAND. We’re seeing improvements in inventory, seeing improvements in pricing. Utilization is starting to pick up. And our perspective would be the same as technology advances will be what drives the spending. And we do have signals that, as we suggested that the spending will pick up.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Toshiya, relative to Applied in DRAM as I talked about earlier, we’ve gained more than 10 points of overall DRAM WFE share, over the last 10 years. And then if you look at the technologies for DRAM going forward, periphery moving to higher speed IO, enabled by our leadership logic products, capacitor scaling, we’re achieving patterning share gains. And I’ve talked about very strong position in advanced packaging, including high bandwidth memory; we’re really well positioned there to continue our outperformance in DRAM. And as Brice said or I said earlier also, we think that business is going to remain very healthy for us. NAND for Applied, we see the revenue up a fair percentage in 2024 versus 2023, but the total amount is still far below 2022. So that’s a little bit more color.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking y question. One of your peers alluded to this on their last earnings call and talked about a push-out on advanced foundry-logic programs, due to potentially persistent delays in chip sack funding. I mean I think the industry thought that after Congress and the President signed off on the CHIPS Bill, I think it was like 18 months ago that grant funding would be appropriated at least in 2023, but here we are in February 2024 and still no grant disbursements. Obviously, all fab programs will launch at some point, right, but maybe some near-term movements on timing due to the absence of this grant funding. Is that what’s driving some of the leading-edge foundry-logic program delays that you guys talked about in your opening remarks?
Brice Hill: Okay, Harlan, I’ll make a comment there. I do think those schedule changes that have been in the news, we’re up-to-date on those. So our outlook is consistent with any of those discussions and schedule changes that you’re talking about. On the CHIPS Act, we’ve recently seen news reports about the government beginning to accelerate that process. We’re in the process ourselves of preparing our application on the R&D side and expecting that to open soon. So I think the answer to your question is, yes, it is affecting schedules, but we don’t expect it will change the ultimate destination of those projects.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question please.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help us quantify how much your ICAPS business grew in calendar 2023. And then as we think about the foundry-logic business for 2024, do you think the recovery in leading-edge can offset the decline in ICAPS?
Brice Hill: Okay, Joe thanks. So I think what we’ve highlighted publicly on ICAPS is that grew approximately 40% in 2022, and it grew faster than that in 2023. And so we wouldn’t change that and be more specific. But to your point, it’s been the strongest market for us. It’s now the largest market for Applied. Gary highlighted that there’s innovations across that market. It’s very important to us from an investment perspective. And so you’ll see us continue to focus on serving that market and the growth. And then the second part was the linearity across the quarters. We’re not giving guidance across the quarters. But since we did highlight that we expect some digestion in ICAPS, and we highlighted we expect leading edge to accelerate. We’ll leave it to you to kind of think about what – which is the stronger force and how the next few quarters go forward. But that is the right shape of those two end markets.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, Joe, just let me add. I think our perspective hasn’t changed at all, relative to how we see the market. So we still see semiconductors at $1 trillion by 2030. And if you look at – there’s some powerful drivers in the digital transformation of every industry. AI, certainly, there’s a lot of focus there. And AI server has 8 times more foundry-logic content and eight times more DRAM compute memory content. So as Brice said earlier, and I think as you’ve heard from others, I think there’s a pretty positive perspective on 2025. And I think longer term we have a very positive perspective relative to semiconductor growth, equipment growing as faster, faster and Applied outgrowing the equipment market continuing to outgrow, as we have for the last five years. So I think quarter-to-quarter or half-to-half, frankly, we don’t focus as much on that, as we do this secular growth that we see in this industry and the great opportunities Applied has, as I’ve talked about, relative to the major inflections. So anyway, that’s the way we think about it.
Joe Quatrochi: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks. I had a clarification and a question. So the clarification, Brice, is the 2023 WFE baseline, would you agree with something like $86 billion to $87 billion? So if you can clarify what your baseline is when you say that you gain share? And then my question is on China WFE. So if I use your numbers, it implies WFE from China is roughly $30 billion in 2023, maybe a little bit less. I know the customers are not stockpiling tools per se, but we know that SMIC and some of the other public companies, they have revenue to support what they spend. But that seems like only about half of that amount. So I guess the question is, would you disagree with the idea that maybe half of what’s coming from China is companies just kind of getting off the ground and trying to displace what’s being imported from the U.S. or Europe. And I guess, Gary, the real crux of the question is that the China stuff is not really a free lunch. It’s sort of duplicative with spending happening elsewhere. So how do you handicap that when you plan your business going forward? Thanks. 
Brice Hill: Okay, Tim. Thank you. So, on the 2023 WFE, we’ve been careful not to engage in the discussion about that. We just shared what our view of Applied’s performance in our view of that market. And for us, 2023 was a strong year. We talked about ICAPS strength. We talked about DRAM strength, Packaging strength, et cetera. And so we’ll just have to wait and see what the third parties say about the size of the market. For us, we saw a strong market. On the China WFE we agree. We don’t see stockpiling. There are a number of new customers. So I don’t know if it’s exactly the partition that you described, in terms of leading and public companies versus not. But, we do think there are a large number of projects that are under investment, where we see over the next four years, added wafer start capacity, planned wafer start capacity that market will be a strong market for us across the planning horizon. And so I think it is a mix. You’ve got real demand there. When we look at the macro, we compare the amount of capacity put in place to local China consumption, and we think they’re still behind the amount of local China consumption. So we think the investments are rational. And actually, the utilizations look okay. They’re lower than rest of the world generally speaking, but they’re improving, and we expect yields to be improving also over time. And then I know, Gary, you’re asking Gary, about the free lunch. We think you’re right from the perspective of no capacity, we’re planning for all of the tools that we sell, whether it’s to China or whether it’s to a government incentivized project. None of these things, we think, increase the amount of equipment installed sort of abnormally such that it’s not going to be used and not going to serve an end market. So we don’t believe that China demand is an end line free launch. We don’t believe the government incentives are a free lunch from that perspective, it’s just affecting a location of needed equipment. Thank you. 
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. 
Joseph Moore: Yes, I wonder if you could give us some clarity on the $500 million of HBM related revenue that you’re forecasting – and actually – that’s a relatively small portion of your overall DRAM run rate, at least. And I guess I would have thought it would be even bigger. Can you talk about that? And then there’s more than just HBM, when it comes to Advanced Packaging for AI DRAM people are doing stacks for other types of memory? Are you – is that HBM kind of encompassing all of the Advanced Packaging? Or is there other opportunity above and beyond that?
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Joe. So on the DRAM, I think going back to that Q4, the first quarter, we saw elevated DRAM from the China demand. That was the approximation we used for the impact of that. So you’re right, it doesn’t – it’s not going to exactly describe every single quarter, but I think that was a good estimate of the incremental that we’re seeing. So we’ll end up with three straight quarters of incremental DRAM shipping to customers in China for those allowed technologies. And Gary, on the...
Gary Dickerson: Yes, Joe. On the HBM, again, the HBM packaging is what we talked about increasing to almost $0.5 billion in 2024. And our overall Packaging – overall Advanced Packaging is around $1.5 billion. So that’s kind of how to think about it. About $0.5 billion in HBM Packaging and the total Advanced Packaging for us is around $1.5 billion.
Joseph Moore: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question please. 
Brian Chin: Hi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting [ph] us ask a question here. Just curious, in route to Applied doing better than the industry over the full year. In terms of the handshake that occurs maybe around midyear, but between some digestion and ICAPS and some pickup in advanced foundry-logic – but the current timing around this suggest maybe a bigger dip in revenue in the July quarter?
Brice Hill: Hi, Brian, it’s Brice. So yes, we’re not going to guide future quarters beyond the outlook quarter. So we’ve given you the shape that we think the end markets will take. And to your point, it’s hard to tell which force will be stronger, whether leading – growing leading edge or a little digestion on the ICAPS side. So we’re not going to call that until we get to those quarters.
Brian Chin: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Your question please.
Charles Shi: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a long-term question for leading-edge foundry-logic. So you guys talked a lot about the Material engineering potentially driving outperformance. If I look at the back in the last 10 years, I mean, I think the back half of the last decade, I mean, between 2015 and 2019 because the manufacturers kind of slow to jump on to EUV, there was a lot more adoption of multi-pattern. – actually led to like outperformance of the depth [ph] and edge equipment suppliers like Applied Materials, but the last five years because of the EUV adoption seems to be that trend has reversed a little bit. But looking out for the next five years, I know there are recent discussions about maybe high end EUV may not actually get adopted before 2030. Does that – does Applied think that may lead to more of the multi-patterning EUV again and that could actually drive up the material engineering intensity again? And any thoughts would be helpful. Thank you. 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question. So one thing I would point to, one of our largest customers, they talked about what’s driving their road map going forward. They talked about something called design technology co-optimization. So what they said basically was that much of the area scaling they were driving going forward is coming from new structures and new materials. So an example is backside power you can get 30% area savings through that type of a structure with no change in feature size. So I think what – certainly, what we see and we’re working with customers for technology nodes out, past the end of the decade, we see the relative contribution of materials innovations spending going higher, the percentage of that going higher. Gate-all-around, backside power, there’s CFAT technology. There’s many different innovations, Packaging technologies. All of those areas, we have over 50% share opportunity in those inflections that are very accretive. And again, we do see a relative contribution from – of spending for those innovations to go higher over time. I’ll give you one more data point. So gate-all-around. Gate-all-around is a new innovation and the transistor to process the data faster. We see Gate-all-around ramping to more than $1.5 billion for Applied revenue in 2024 and almost double that amount in calendar 2025. So again, those are – they’re very powerful new architecture inflections, where Applied is extremely well positioned.
Charles Shi: Thank you. 
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Charles. And operator, we’re getting close to the end of the session. So if we have time for one more quick question, please.
Operator: Certainly one moment for our final question for today then. And our final question for today comes from the line of Thomas O’Malley from Barclays. Your question please. 
Thomas O’Malley: Hey guys, thanks for sneaking me in. I had another question on kind of the handoff in the first half, for the second half. Clearly, you’re kind of talking about the ICAPS business, getting a little softer in the back half, but leading edge is really picking up slightly offsetting. In terms of where you’re seeing the strength in the leading edge, is that greenfield new fab build-outs or is that existing capacity additions? Any kind of help on where that strength is coming from in the second half would be helpful. Thank you. 
Brice Hill: Sure, Tom. It’s Brice. Typically, it’s greenfield. So I think that when companies start the first part of a process, you’re typically putting in greenfield and you’ll shift some of your reused equipment later if you’re able to do that. So that would be my expectation. Thank you. 
Thomas O’Malley: Thank you. 
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Tom. And appreciate that question. Brice, how would you like to give us your closing thoughts for today?
Brice Hill: Sure, Mike. What stands out to me from a summary perspective, is that we’ve anticipated the major market trends and we work closely with our customers to invest in the most important technology inflections. I think will be a major beneficiary, as AI and IoT spending grows over the next several years. Our number one positions in gate-all-around, backside power and advanced packaging are higher than our corporate average, which gives me confidence that we’ll continue to gain share.  Beyond our strong portfolio, we’re also making operational progress, which makes me confident we can meet strong demand and make progress in gross margins. Finally, our services growth is accelerating to double digits and generating more than enough profit to fund our growing dividend. Also, I hope to see many of you at the Morgan Stanley conference on March 4. Mike, thank you. Let’s close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Brice. And we’d like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of today’s call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by 5 o’clock Pacific Time, and we’d really like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-11-16 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials' Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q filing with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on our website at ir.appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On Tuesday evening, December 12, Applied will lead a panel on the future of logic near the IEDM Conference in San Francisco. Joining us will be leading technology executives from Intel, Samsung, and TSMC, along with Google, Qualcomm, Synopsys, and the EV Group. There won't be a webcast. So we hope you'll join us in San Francisco. And with that introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. Before we begin, I'd like to speak briefly about Israel. As many of you know, Applied Materials has had a significant presence in Israel for nearly 30 years. We were shocked by the terrorist attacks of October 7 and the outbreak of war with its immeasurable suffering and loss. Our team in Israel is proving their resilience at this dangerous time and Applied Materials is committed to do our part to help our families stay safe until more peaceful conditions return. Now turning to our results. We delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2023 with record earnings in our fourth quarter and record revenue earnings and cash flow for the year as a whole. I would like to recognize the hard work and commitment of our global team to deliver these outstanding results. As this is our year end call, I'll begin my prepared remarks by reviewing our performance and key accomplishments over the past 12 months. I'll then talk about our longer-term growth thesis for the industry and Applied before concluding with our outlook and priorities for 2024. While semiconductor and wafer fabrication equipment spending were both down in 2023, Applied was able to demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio, as well as the central role we play enabling major industry inflections. Our Semiconductor Systems business delivered mid-single digit growth for the fiscal year and remains on track for growth in calendar 2023 which will be the fifth consecutive year that we've outperformed the wafer fab equipment market. We believe we can sustain this outperformance over the coming years, thanks to the leadership positions we've established at the major technology inflections that will enable our customers' roadmaps. In the past 12 months, many of our business units delivered new records and major milestones, including Etch where we passed 10,000 shipments of our Sym3 chamber. We also released new products and secured incremental production tool of record positions and Gate All Around, Backside Power Delivery, patterning advanced DRAM and High-Bandwidth Memory and heterogeneous integration. At the same time, we strengthened our ICAPS business that serves IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensor customers with new products and application wins in etch, epitaxy, implant as well as metrology and inspection. In Services, we delivered low-single digit revenue growth in fiscal 2023, overcoming headwinds, including lower fab utilization rates and trade restrictions. In this period, our total installed base increased 5%. In fact, our installed base of process chambers is now more than twice as big as our nearest competitor. In addition, there are more than 14,000 tools that are not chamber based including CMP, implant, and metrology and inspection. We grew the number of tools under long-term subscription agreements which now generate 63% of our total parts and service revenues. We also maintained the renewal rate of these subscriptions at 90%. In 2023, we continued to focus on our operations and supply chain, and we've made significant and sustainable improvements. Compared to this time last year, we are providing customers with better on-time delivery and shipment quality, while normalizing our inventory levels. More importantly, our operations are ready to scale as the industry grows over the years to come. Across the company, we're in a great position to enable our customer success and profitably grow Applied Materials as this next era of industry expansion takes shape. Looking to the future, there are four key components of our growth thesis. First, we believe that semiconductors will outgrow GDP as a digital transformation of the global economy progresses. Second, we expect the market for wafer fab equipment to grow as fast or faster than the market for semiconductors. This is because the industry roadmap is becoming more complex and chipmakers need to deploy more technology to move from one node to the next. Third, we believe that Applied will outperform wafer fab equipment because the key technology inflections are enabled by materials science and materials engineering where Applied has the broadest, most connected and most enabling portfolio of solutions. And fourth, we believe we can grow our service business as fast or faster than our equipment business by providing customers with advanced service solutions that accelerate technology transfer from R&D to high volume manufacturing and optimize device performance, yield, and cost in their fabs. By identifying major industry inflections early and making strategic multiyear investments in our product portfolio and capabilities, Applied Materials is best positioned to benefit from this exciting period of industry innovation and growth. We have by far the broadest portfolio of unit process technology to address our customers' high value problems in transistor, interconnect, 3D memory, specialty devices, and heterogeneous integration. We're able to combine these technologies in unique ways to create co-optimized and integrated solutions, and we are seeing strong pull from our customers to work on higher value module and device integration problems. At no time in our history have we been closer to our customers. We have built a unique platform for a collaborative innovation and commercialization of next-generation technologies. We will significantly expand this collaboration platform with EPIC, enabling Applied and our partners to innovate the way we innovate. And our advanced technology enabled service offerings are seen by customers as increasingly valuable, especially during technology transfer and fab ramp. These advanced services also provide growing subscription revenue streams for Applied. Moving to our near-term outlook and priorities for the year ahead. While we are mindful of the complex macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we see demand for Applied products remaining robust with some changes within the mix. In 2024, we expect demand from our leading edge foundry logic customers to be stronger year-on-year, underpinned by higher PC, cloud, and AI data center spending as well as the initial build-out of Gate-All-Around nodes. We see demand for our ICAPS business being lower, mainly due to softness in the industrial automation and automotive end-markets. In DRAM, both pricing and utilization are improving for our customers and we see demand for Applied's products remaining strong. And we believe NAND spending will be up year-on-year, but still far below 2022 and less than 10% of wafer fab equipment spending overall. We expect NAND to remain a lower percentage of the wafer fab equipment mix moving forward. In terms of the global trade environment, the October 2023 export control rule changes in the U.S. were primarily focused on alignment with other countries. The rules are complex and while we are working with the government to clarify certain details, we see no incremental material impact to Applied at this time. As I look ahead, I strongly believe that Applied Materials has the right capabilities, strategy and partnerships. In fiscal 2024, our major focus areas include driving R&D programs to further differentiate our portfolio and extend our leadership at the key inflections that enable future industry growth, continuing to make operational and supply chain improvements to better serve customers, capture economies of scale and drive productivity across the enterprise, and ensuring that as we scale the company, we continue to reduce our environmental impact in-line with Applied's collaborative Net Zero playbook as announced earlier this year. Before I hand over to Brice, let me summarize. In fiscal 2023, Applied grew our semiconductor equipment and service businesses even though our markets were down year-on-year. For calendar 2023, we were on track to outperform the wafer fab equipment market for the fifth year in a row. We believe this outperformance is sustainable, thanks to our strong positions at all the key industry inflections, the strength of our customer collaborations and growing demand for our advanced services. And we remain positive about our long-term growth opportunities, where we expect semiconductors to grow faster than GDP, wafer fab equipment to grow as fast or faster than semiconductors, Applied to outperform the wafer fab equipment market and our Service business to grow as fast or faster than equipment sales. Now, I'll hand over to Brice.
Brice Hill: Thank you, Gary, I'd like to start by thanking our teams for delivering record results this year and for making sustainable operational improvements in our inventory management, manufacturing linearity and on-time delivery performance. On today's call, I'll summarize our results for the fiscal year and Q4 as well as provide our guidance for Q1. Before going into the results, I'll share my perspective on our unique business model and how it creates attractive returns for our long-term shareholders. Applied creates value by directing nearly $3 billion of annualized R&D into one of the most important markets of the world, semiconductors. Because we have the broadest and deepest equipment portfolio and expertise, we are invited to work closely with our customers as a trusted partner to identify and holistically solve their most valuable technical challenges. Our R&D spending helps customers modify materials at atomic levels and on an industrial scale to deliver better semiconductors and end products for strategic growth markets like artificial intelligence. Our relationships with our customers provide us with insights in the end-market and technology roadmap trends and allow us to focus our spending on projects that have a high probability of commercial adoption and strong financial returns. As a result of the R&D invested in our customer success, we now have line of sight to market share leadership and growth across the key semiconductor manufacturing inflections, including Gate-All-Around, Backside Power, heterogeneous integration, high-bandwidth memory and 3D DRAM. The strategies we use to help solve challenges in leading-edge logic and memory are also being deployed in the ICAPS markets where our growth in 2023, more than offset weakness in NAND and leading edge logic. ICAPS is also a strategic growth market fueled by powerful trends like edge computing and renewable energy. Applied's focused and effective R&D investments have led to fantastic results for our shareholders. Over the past 10 years, we've grown revenue at a compound rate of over 13%, non-GAAP EPS at nearly 30% and free cash flow at 33%. We've increased our quarterly dividend per share at a compound rate of more than 12% over this period, and earlier this year, we announced our belief that our free cash flow can support doubling our previous dividend per share over the next several years. Looking ahead to the next 10 years, we expect semiconductors to grow faster than GDP. We expect the equipment market to grow as fast or faster than semiconductors due to increasing technical complexity. We expect Applied's equipment business to outgrow the market due to our strong portfolio of products and solutions that are squarely targeted at the highest value inflections. And we expect our Services business to grow as fast or faster than our equipment business as we help our customers generate increasing value from the industry's largest installed base of more than 48,000 tools. Next, I'll summarize our fiscal year results. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased nearly 3% to a record $26.5 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 20 basis points to 46.8% as our value based pricing and cost improvement actions more than offset the impact of inflation. Non-GAAP OpEx increased 13% to $4.69 billion, with the majority of the increase in R&D. Non-GAAP operating profit declined 2% to $7.72 billion and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 29.1%. Non-GAAP EPS increased 4.5% to $8.05 per share. We generated record operating cash flow of $8.7 billion, and record free cash flow of $7.6 billion. Shareholder distributions were approximately $3.16 billion. We paid $975 million in cash dividends and used approximately $2.2 billion to repurchase 18 million shares at an average price below $123 per share. We remain committed to returning 80% to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time and returned 87% over the past three years. Now I'll summarize our Q4 results. On a year-over-year basis, net sales of $6.72 billion were slightly lower. Non-GAAP EPS rose 4% to a record $2.12. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 130 basis points to 47.3%, and non-GAAP OpEx grew 8.8% to $1.19 billion with around two-thirds of the increase in R&D. Turning to the segments. Semi systems revenue declined 3% year-over-year to $4.88 billion and segment non-GAAP operating margin was flat at 36.9%. For the full year, semi systems grew revenue by 5% and outperformed the market, delivering record net sales overall and in foundry logic as well as in implant, packaging, Metals Deposition and CVD. Applied Global Services revenue grew 4% year-over-year in Q4 to a record $1.47 billion and segment non-GAAP operating margin grew 100 basis points to 29.3%. For the full year, AGS revenue increased 3%, demonstrating how the underlying growth drivers of the business, more than compensated for the trade restrictions enacted in October of 2022, along with fab utilization rates that declined over the past year. AGS growth is a function of three things. The number of tools in the installed base, the increase in service intensity as process complexity increases, and the number of subscription agreements which increased revenue per tool. In 2023, we increased the installed base by 5%. And we increased the percentage of tools under service agreement by 3 percentage points to 16,600. An important catalyst for AGS is that we are adding entirely new kinds of subscription agreements including sensor and AI-based solutions in areas like tool matching for fab ramp acceleration. In Q4, we signed a unique environmental services agreement under which a large number of process tools and sub fab resources are connected to Applied eco-efficiency hardware and software products, all delivered as a service that helps our customers reduce electricity consumption and carbon emissions. In addition, we recently signed our largest global comprehensive service agreement ever. Finally, AGS continues to produce more than enough operating profit to pay the company's dividend. Moving now to Display. Q4 revenue increased to $298 million and segment non-GAAP operating margin increased to 22.5%. We continue to expect the Display cycle and Applied's Display business to improve modestly in 2024, and we look forward to our opportunity to drive OLED technology into the laptop and tablet markets in 2025. Turning to cash flows in Q4. We generated nearly $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $1.25 billion in free cash flow. We distributed nearly $968 million to shareholders including $268 million in dividends and $700 million in buybacks. We repurchased 5 million shares at an average price of $138.54. Next, I'll discuss our business in China. As Gary indicated, we do not expect an incremental material impact from the recently updated trade rules. Our business in China grew as expected in Q4, largely due to an increase in trailing edge DRAM shipments that contributed close to $500 million in revenue. In Q4, our overall revenue in China was 44% of company sales. For the full year, revenue in China was 27% of sales with Semi systems sales in China composing 20% and AGS and Display sales in China the remaining 7%. We believe equipment demand in China is likely to remain healthy for an extended period because China's domestic manufacturing capacity remains significantly below its share of worldwide semiconductor demand. In addition, while nameplate fab capacity is growing in China, effective capacity is likely to remain below industry averages for some time until product and process yields gradually improve. Now, I'll share our guidance for Q1. We expect our revenue to be $6.47 billion, plus or minus $400 million and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.90, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi systems revenue to be $4.7 billion with ongoing strength in trailing edge DRAM. We expect AGS revenue to be $1.46 billion and Display revenue should be around $235 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.23 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 13%. Thank you. And now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. Our goal is to help as many of our analysts as possible. With that in mind, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have another question, please requeue, and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm sure you saw the news report that came out pretty much coincident with your earnings release from Reuters that talked about a potential investigation into your China shipments to SNEC. It also mentioned though, that you've already disclosed on October -- in October '22, a potential subpoena. I was just wondering, can you tell us like what is going on here? What did you actually disclose around potential legal issues related to your shipments in China around the export controls at this point? And I mean, I don't know whether you can comment on this report or not, but any comment you might have on the news article, would be helpful. I don't think you had much time to put it in the script.
Brice Hill: Stacy, hi. It's Brice. Thanks for the question. We did disclose last year in our K that we've received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office, and they requesting information related to certain shipments to China. Well, we would say is, we're fully cooperating with the government on this matter. And of course, we're -- we remain committed to complying to all of the trade rules. And as you can imagine, because this is an ongoing legal matter, we can’t add to any of the comments that are out there at this point but it's been a regular disclosure for us.
Stacy Rasgon: So there's nothing new though. This is all related to whatever was already going on?
Brice Hill: Yeah. I just can't add any comments to this. But yes, we did disclose this last October, I believe.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question please.
Vivek Arya: Well, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that you expect China demand to stay healthy. And I'm trying to understand what that means because you did have these incremental DRAM shipments. So, I guess the first specific question is, what are you assuming for those DRAM shipments in your January quarter outlook? And should we understand from your China strength comment that your China sales conceptually could stay at least flattish next year or could they even grow? Just high level, what does, stay strong mean to you as it comes to the sales impact in fiscal '24?
Brice Hill: Hi, Vivek. Yeah. So for Q1, in particular, as you highlighted, we did see elevated shipments to China. In Q4, it was 44% of our sales mix. In Q1, we expect it to be elevated again. We'll continue to ship DRAM products at a high level in Q1 and when we think about the mix for China for the rest of '24, we're not ready to give a guide yet, but most of this business is ICAPS business and it's been very strong growth for '22 and '23 for us. For '24, we expect it to be a strong -- still strong. It may not be as strong as it was in '23, but China is the largest component to that. So again, we're not ready to guide that, but our Q1 guide, you will still see an elevated mix for China.
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Vivek. This is Gary. Just also what Brice said on the prepared remarks was for the full year China was 27% and actually it's down a little bit. But really pretty much same zip code as it was in the previous year. And as we go through the year, we would think it gets more back to the historical averages.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question please.
Chris Caso: Yeah. Thank you. Just another question on the ICAPS. Just unpacking some of what you said. So perhaps you could talk to the non-China part of the ICAPS business. It sounds like that's where you're seeing a little bit of incremental weakness, again in line with some of your customers. And then, as -- I guess along with that with what you just said is trying to coming back to the historic averages. Is that a function of, just other business growing as opposed to China going down?
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Chris. On the second part, I think the reason China comes back to its normal average is around 30%. It's just because the elevated DRAM shipments will normalize after Q1. So we had high DRAM in Q4. We expect that in Q1 and that should slow down and after that it will be, mostly ICAPS business again. And then, thinking of ICAPS In general, what I would say again is, we had significant growth in '22, significant even higher growth in '23. So when we think long-term, we're expecting mid to high-single digits of growth for ICAPS across several years. And to your point, looking right now this year, Q1 is actually a strong guide for ICAPS, but we do see lower utilization. We have seen some push-outs from different customers as they re-time some of their fab projects. And we did see the lower utilization in Q4. So we do think that Q -- our '24 will be a strong year for ICAPS but may not be as strong as '23, but again it's, it's much higher than it was in '22 because of the growth cycle that has gone through.
Chris Caso: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon and thank you so much. Gary, I had a question on '24 WFE, you gave really good color by application in your prepared remarks, leading-edge foundry and logic and NAND up. DRAM, it sounded like you're thinking flattish and ICAPS maybe down a little bit. Curious if you can, perhaps quantify how you're thinking about these different applications and perhaps for the overall WFE market into next year. And more importantly, you highlighted how you guys have outperformed the market for five consecutive years. Is it fair to assume that '24 could be the sixth consecutive year given what you see in your backlog today? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Toshiya. Yeah. I would say that relative to Applied's performance, I'm very optimistic. In leading foundry logic, we're really well-positioned for the major inflections that our customers were ramping Gate-All-Around and Backside Power Delivery. Gate-All-Around, we'll see some revenue in '24, but that's going to be ramping more significantly in the future years. And Backside Power, we'll see some revenue also in '24, but also a significant ramp in the coming years. And each one of those inflections is a billion dollar incremental opportunity for Applied and we can capture more. We're on track to capture more than 50% of the overall spend for those major inflections. So really good position in foundry logic for Applied overall, as we said in the prepared remarks. We think that business will be healthy in '24. DRAM is another case where we're really well positioned for the major inflections. We've gained 10 points of overall DRAM share in the last ten years. And again, going forward, we feel like we're well positioned. We have design wins for those future inflections in DRAM, and we see opportunities to continue to drive share there. In packaging, that business is a billion dollars for us today and we're in very good position for all of the different architecture inflections in packaging. And there again, we have an opportunity to gain over 50% share in packaging inflections as that goes forward. So all of those areas that we talked about, the leading edge foundry logic, DRAM, packaging, all of those areas are very strong for us. And as we said, ICAPS will be weaker in '24, but those opportunities, those markets will offset some of the weakness in ICAPS. And Brice, I don't know if you want to add anything on the overall market.
Brice Hill: No. I think. I think that's good. We just -- it's better for us to give you insights into each of the end markets and tell you what we see and that's the best way we can communicate what we see going forward.
Toshiya Hari: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Shankar from TD Cowen. Your question please.
Steven Chin: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Steven calling on behalf of Krish. I guess a question I have is on gross margins. Just given the comments about normalization of China revenues in the coming quarters and also sort of the ICAPS dynamics, what are sort of the slightly longer term or medium term implications to gross margins if the mix of China goes down? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Hi, Krish -- sorry. Hi. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Thank you. So for gross margins, first, I would say to investors, we're still committed to what we had modeled, although we delayed it for a year. So we're modeling 48% to 48.5%. That's what we're committed as an interim goal to raising our margins. As you highlighted, in Q4, we had 47.3%. It was buoyed by the 44% mix of China. If you strip that away, it's probably 100 basis points worth of uplift. Last quarter we highlighted that our underlying gross margin today, if not benefited or impacted by something specific in the market, is probably 46.6% or 46.7%. And we do expect to make gradual improvements toward that goal in 2025 as we move forward. That'll be primarily, continued progress in value pricing as we work to offset high inflation impacts across all of our expenses and then cost reductions.
Steven Chin: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J. P. Morgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The team services business continues to drive strong year-over-year trends. Great to see the subscription attached continuing to rise. Utilizations are still depressed across your customer base, but have they stabilized, especially across advanced foundry logic and memory? And then just as a quick one, operating margin in AGS are still about 200 basis points below the 30%. 31% that you drove for six consecutive quarters through fiscal Q3 of last year. Are inflationary pressures still the biggest factor or is it mix related as your 200-millimeter ICAP shipments continue to remain strong and any line of sight on getting back into that sort of low 30% range on AGS.
Brice Hill: Okay, Harlan, thanks for the question. First question on stabilized utilization rates. I think in general, I would say no, because we did see lower utilization rates in ICAPS, as I just highlighted in Q4. And so there is some digestion there in ICAPS, at this point. Otherwise, as I look across the rest of, the segments, if you think about the memory components and you think about leading logic, I would say that's been fairly stable. On the operating margin side for AGS, and I -- thanks for highlighting the business because, we did grow this year despite the setback at removing some of the China tools from our ability to service going forward. That's really what set us back from a margin perspective and shrank the business in the year and remove some of the, smaller customer, better margin products that we had. But going forward, we will be improving margins in that business and we're committed to that low double-digit growth rate for our services business. And again, just the components of that will be a growing installed base, a more intense, tool need for services and spares and information services, and then the ability to have the win-win with subscription agreements with our customers for those services.
Harlan Sur: Great color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. My question is on ICAPS as well. Gary, I think in the past you talked about ICAPs being about half of your business, and given the slowdown, you're expecting a couple of things, I guess you talked about China slowing down a bit in the short term. How do you see the non-China ICAPS business over the next 12 months? And where do you see ICAPS versus the other business mix, I guess, exiting, let's say fiscal '24. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Srini. Thanks for the question. So ICAPS is half of the total foundry logic business. So historically that's -- it's been in that zip code. So foundry logic is about a third, ICAPS is about a third, memory is about a third, with the compute memory DRAM being stronger than storage memory NAND. So that's the mix. And I would expect that that mix will continue going forward. I mean, in any point in time, you could have some small changes in the mix, but we see foundry logic still remaining very strong going forward with that, about two-thirds of our overall business split between the leading edge and ICAPs. If you think about the big inflections, there's AI for high performance computing, but there's a lot of growth in edge computing across many different industries. So when we look at the markets, we think that mix is going to be pretty much similar to what we've talked about before, one-third foundry logic leading, one-third ICAPS, one-third memory. And then did you have another question or Brice, did you want to add anything?
Brice Hill: Yeah. I'll just add on, just, Srini, just a reminder for investors here. Our longer term view is mid to high single digits for ICAPS as well as the whole semi component, but mid to high single digits. And we do expect that to be consistent for China. We do expect that to be consistent for non-China. And we saw -- as we communicated in our prior quarter, we did see several geographies growing faster than China. So this is definitely a global market, not just a China market. And China isn't even, half of the market, as we communicated. And then as far as the slowness goes, or, any lighter year, what I would say is our guide in Q1 includes an ICAPS that's very strong and continues to be very strong. So the way we're thinking about it is '22 was very strong, '23 was even stronger. We may take a breath here with lower utilization, but we expect this market to continue to grow.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I know you guys have been pretty reticent to provide a 2023, WFE number. Everyone else's, first they said 75. Well, first they said 70, then they said 75 and now they're saying 80. But it really can't be 80 because if you add up all five suppliers, it's more like flat year-over-year. So can you give a sense of what you think WFE will be this year? I mean, I do agree, even if it's $90 billion, you're going to still gain share this year. But -- so I guess the first part of the question is, what is the baseline this year for 2020 -- for, WFE? And then I want to find out what's the message on 2024? I hear the message about mix changing, but are you committing to WFE being up next year or you're not willing to make that commitment yet? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Hi, Tim. Thanks for the question. So for '23, we've heard all of those numbers also, and we just feel it's best for us to report what we see from our seat. And for us, '23 was a growth year. We highlighted as we went through the last few quarters how strong DRAM and ICAPS were and how, having exposure to those two markets and a leadership position in those markets helped us offset weakness that were in some of the other markets, NAND and leading logic primarily. So definitely everybody can do the math. They can see what our numbers will be with the guide. And that should help with your calculation of what the overall market would be. And then for '24, we're not calling the total. Again, we're trying to characterize what we're seeing in each market. We do think DRAM will continue to be strong. We think NAND will come up off of a, low position. We think leading logic will grow through the year, especially as Gate-All-Around begins to ship. And we think ICAPS, it's strong in Q1 still, but ICAPS may take a breath with lower utilization. So we'll have to see how that plays out. And then packaging was strong in '23 and we expect that to continue.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Great, Brice. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question please.
Joe Quatrochi: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help us understand just relative to that long term mid high single-digit growth for ICAPS. What did it grow in fiscal '23? And then as we look into '24, how do you think about just leading edge recovery of spending, offsetting the declines in ICAPS?
Brice Hill: What was the second part? Joe, can you repeat the second part?
Joe Quatrochi: Yeah. Just the recovery of leading edge foundry logic offsetting the weakness in ICAPS.
Brice Hill: Okay. So on the first -- on the first part. I think we're still hearing different estimates of what semiconductors might be in 2023 from a growth perspective. What we've been saying from an equipment perspective is the growth was very high. So we described that in '22 at 40% plus and we've said it was faster in '23 from an equipment perspective. So, the actual semiconductor is obviously not growing that fast. But the equipment market, in preparing for the growth going forward, that's the approximate rate that we see. And then on the leading logic side, and offsetting ICAPS, again, our Q1 guidance, actually ICAPS is very strong, continues to be strong in our Q1 from a sales perspective. We do see lower utilization. We have seen some pushouts. So we're expecting that it won't be as strong a year as it was in '23, although still very strong. And where we'll see some offset is growing; leading logic, because leading logic has been lower, the past few quarters and we expect that to pick up through the year as new node investments, especially with Gate-All-Around start to ship in earnest.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. The other thing I would add is that, as I said earlier, we're really well-positioned for the major inflections. If you look at foundry logic, Gate-All-Around, spending starts to ramp in '24. We've been gaining share in DRAM and we're well positioned for those inflections. And as Brice said, packaging was strong in '23. We believe it'll still be strong in '24, and we're positioned to capture more than 50% of the spend in all of those different packaging architectures as they ramp in '24. So again, all of those areas will continue to be strong for Applied in '24 and beyond.
Joe Quatrochi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. You've talked about seeing some of these trends in ICAPS that have you thinking that there might be some deceleration. And you talked about China being good in DRAM and DRAM coming down. The China portion of ICAPS, should we be thinking about the utilization of those foundries? To the extent that we've seen that, it was already low and they were spending a lot, the utilization is coming down, they still seem to be spending a lot. Do you see that as a lead indicator for your part of the business?
Brice Hill: Hi, Joe. Thanks for the question. I think utilization in China and utilization for ICAPS in general did come down a little bit this cycle. That's definitely visible from a global perspective. When we think about what's happening in China, we have a broad customer base that are, serving all of the different end markets. And so our perspective is -- our perspective is, they are probably -- they are working on ramping their yields and coming up to, mature product yields over time. So I think this is partly, just a statement of where they are in the maturity curve of each of these product -- or projects. When we think about the market as a total, it's a long list of customers, it's a number of fab projects, that are being installed across the country. We think about the total capacity that's being put in place and the goal of being self-sufficient from a chip production perspective, and they're a long way from that, but we think we're -- they're committed to that as a whole. They have incentives in place to do it. So we view that market will be, a stable part of our portfolio going forward.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, Joe. This is Gary. Also, as Brice said, if you look at the efficiency of the spending, it's going to be less, especially with those new customers for many years. So the wafer starts versus the output, the yields are going to be much less from a device standpoint. So again, that's going to impact the overall output. And we think, again, the gap there with their domestic demand will keep that market healthy for a number of years.
Brice Hill: Yeah, Joe. And just to finish my thoughts, sorry, I missed one point. We do think the lower utilization, and we've seen some push outs in the ICAPS business. This is a global statement. We do think that that's a signal that it'll be slightly less, than the roaring growth we've seen the last two years. And that's why we're saying it'll be a strong year. It just won't be as strong as what we saw in '22 and '23.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thank you. I want to double click on the comments on the DRAM business. If I just look at your Semi systems revenue for DRAM this year, it's tracking to grow 10% to 20% and even exceed the last peak year in '21. But the market is still down quite a bit. The question I have is, how much of this outperformance comes from the market being maybe a lot better than we thought, versus maybe share gains that you may have? Are you seeing anything structural that drives the capital intensity of that DRAM business to be higher? And my last part of it is, is just to clarify, you talked about expecting demand for your DRAM products to remain strong, which I assume means roughly flat in '24. Is that also true for the DRAM market in terms of WFE spend? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Sidney. So, we do think the DRAM business was strong this year, partially strong because of some of the shipments to China customers, where the process they're running was recently clarified to be within the rules, within the allowed trade rules. So that's a partial explanation. But I think we -- when we think of that market, we think that it actually looks like a normal year even without those China shipments that the DRAM market was fairly strong from an equipment perspective. And that matches, recent years where a lot of the spending is technology upgrades, not necessarily new capacity. And we expect that to continue over time.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, Sidney. Just talking with customers, certainly the forecast from them for compute memory is stronger than storage memory. And if you look just at one example on an AI server, the DRAM content there is much higher than an industry standard server. So again, just, I've spent a lot of time on the road this last three months, and they -- customers are pretty optimistic about DRAM longer term and compute memory demand.
Sidney Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question please.
Brian Chin: Hi, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a question. One of your peers recently stated that AI could account for 6 billion of WFE next year. I think more than double the contribution of this year. I know it's difficult to benchmark against these figures, but can you provide a reference point on how you see AI augmenting WFE spending this year, next year, or even beyond, and just kind of maybe a two-parter, but just a clarification, but advanced foundry logic spending, it's coolly dipped in calendar second half. But tying in your earlier comments, it sounds like you expect foundry logic to improve off these lower levels in calendar first half of next year. Is that correct?
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Brian. On the first part for AI, last cycle, we provided some data points that I think are the relevant data points. We believe about 5% of our WFE is supporting AI workloads. That's not just Gen AI, but all AI workloads. And we did highlight that we expect that to grow at -- probably at 30% or higher CAGR going forward. And I think that's fair. So, whatever WFE number you're using, I think if you use 5% and use your 30% growth rate, that's what we think in our equations. And that would be true for leading logic and that would be true for, HBM on the DRAM side. And then on the second question, it's really the advanced logic, we're expecting to accelerate in the second half of '24. In our first half guidance -- sorry, in our first quarter guidance, it'll really be another quarter of strong ICAPS and strong DRAM. No -- not -- it'll be similar in strength from a leading logic and NAND to prior quarters. So you still have that dynamic in Q1. So it'll really be second half that we see improving leading logic.
Brian Chin: Thanks. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham & Company. Your question please.
Charles Shi: Hey, good afternoon. Hi, thanks. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks you expect the WFE to grow as fast or faster than semiconductors, which kind of implies you are thinking WFE intensity, which probably is already at the roughly 20-year high this year to go -- there may be upside to go higher. So really just want to understand your thinking behind, where could the upside be? For example, I think your largest customer in Taiwan is expecting their capital intensity from the current 40% something level to go to what they think is normalized level in the 30s. How do I reconcile your statement versus their statement? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Charles. It's hard to -- we probably won't compare with anybody else's comments, but from our perspective, it has been growing. One of the reasons it's been growing is because ICAPS, that particular business, the mature product technologies, as we've described before, there used to be available, used facilities and available used equipment, and it's really no longer the case. The industry is growing, and without that, just new investments have to be made in wafer starts and capacity, and that's raised the overall intensity level. When we think to the other types of equipment processes, DRAM, NAND, and leading logic, we expect those to be more intensive with more steps from an equipment perspective, requiring new capabilities and new technologies. And that's actually what our R&D is engaged in. So it's, more than intuition that we expect that intensity to go up over time.
Charles Shi: Thanks, Brice.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question.
Michael Sullivan: Yeah. And operator, we have time for two more. Thank you.
Operator: Certainly. Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me slip one more in here. I wanted to explore just a little more the tradeoff between the leading edge and the ICAPS next year. So, I know you said ICAPS is down, foundry logic or leading edge foundry logic, so I am thinking, you said it would sort of offset some of it. Are you thinking that the overall foundry logic, at least for a WFE standpoint, is up, down, or flat in '24 versus the '23 levels, given those dynamics?
Brice Hill: Hi, Stacy. It's Brice. Yeah, we didn't make a call on that. You kind of heard probably the components. I know probably everybody wants us to make a call, but what we're saying is, we have a very strong Q1 still in ICAPS. The dynamics in Q1, assuming things play out as we're forecasting, will be similar to Q4. You'll have a strong DRAM market. You'll have a strong ICAPS market. But we know that there have been some pushouts and there is lower utilization in ICAPS. So we're expecting that market to not be the same, as strong as it was in '23. When we flip and look at leading logic, leading logic is weak in Q4 and it's weak in Q1 also that same dynamic. And we know that new technologies will be ramping, including Gate-All-Around. So we're expecting that to, help throughout the year. Whether that's bigger or smaller than, whatever happens with ICAPS, we can't tell yet, but we'll just have to let that play out.
Stacy Rasgon: It sounds like neither one is dominating over the other, though. Is that a fair way to characterize?
Brice Hill: Yeah. I don't think you can make -- yeah, it's not easy to make a call at this point.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Then our final question, one moment for our final question. And for our final question, we have the line of Jed Dorsheimer from William Blair. Your question please.
Jed Dorsheimer: Hi, thanks, and thanks for letting me squeeze one in here. I just -- quick two parts. I just want to confirm the pushouts that you started to see in ICAPS. Do you -- is -- can you comment on the end market? Was that auto related? And then second, the investigation. I know you don't want to get into any detail or can't there, but it seems like that's also in the ICAPS. Can you confirm those two? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Yeah. On the second, Jed -- thanks for the questions. On the second, I just can't add any commentary to, what we previously discussed with respect to the legal matter. On the first one, there's definitely mixed inventory situations and mixed reports on all the different ICAPS markets. Actually, where we would point is probably being the slowest at this point is industrial. What -- just to add a comment for you. On the auto side, I would say that it may be slower from a unit perspective, but because of the density of, chips in EVs and even newer cars, we're not expecting much weakness in the auto market. So I guess that's the way I would think of that.
Jed Dorsheimer: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Jed, for your question. And Brice, with that, would you like to give us your closing thoughts?
Brice Hill: Thanks, Mike. From a year end and closing perspective, I really like the sustainable operational progress our teams have made. Our Semi systems business grew in a down year and our services business also had a record year, proving its resilience, just like it did in 2019. The R&D investments we've been making in collaboration with our customers put us in a great position for the next wave of inflection spending. We now have a line of sight to market share of over 50% across Gate-All-Around, Backside Power, and Advanced Packaging. At the same time, we're increasing gross margins and generating strong free cash flow, and this sets us up for increasing shareholder distributions. I hope I get to see many of you at the Wells Fargo Conference in Southern California. In the meantime, for those of you in the US, we hope you enjoy a safe and Happy Thanksgiving. Now, Mike, thank you. And let's close the call.
Michael Sullivan: All right. Great. Thanks, Brice. And we would like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of today's call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by 5 o'clock Pacific Time. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-08-17 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's third quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q filing with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And with that introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. In our third fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered results at the high-end of our guidance range. Across the business, our teams are executing well. We are making incremental improvements in our operations as we productively scale the company, and we're driving our technology roadmap, introducing enabling new products and solutions for our customers. In my prepared remarks today, I will start with our big picture view of the IoT-AI era and how this is driving growth and innovation across the industry. I'll then summarize Applied's strategy and how this is enabling us to outgrow the industry this year while also positioning us for sustained outperformance over the longer-term. And finally, I'll cover our near-term performance and outlook, including some recent business highlights. In the summer of 2018, at our AI Design Forum, Applied laid out a thesis explaining how we expected IoT and AI to drive a new wave of semiconductor growth and innovation. Five years later, IoT and AI inflections are having a profound impact across many sectors of the economy, as well as within the semiconductor industry. We view IoT and AI computing as two sides of the same coin. At the edge, consumer devices, vehicles, buildings, factories, and infrastructure are all getting smarter and more capable. Our customers that serve these IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensors markets, or ICAPS, are growing, and represent the largest portion of wafer fab equipment sales in 2023. Increasingly intelligent edge devices are fueling an explosion of data generation that can then be transmitted and combined to create very large datasets for training AI models. High performance AI computing is primarily enabled by hardware innovations. As a result, AI is becoming the key driver of the leading-edge logic and DRAM roadmaps, as well as heterogeneous integration, which creates exciting new innovation opportunities for device designers. In summary, the first part of our thesis is that the combination of IoT and AI drives demand for significantly more chips as well as next-generation silicon technologies. The second part of our thesis relates to how those chips and new technology innovations will be supplied. In terms of technology, as the benefits of traditional Moore's Law 2D scaling slow down, the industry is moving to a new playbook to drive improvements in Power, Performance, Area-Cost and time-to-market. The PPACt playbook has five key elements: new system and device architectures, new 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink, and heterogenous integration. The transition to the new playbook is positive for Applied in two key ways: First, as the roadmap evolves, it is increasingly enabled by advances in materials engineering where Applied has differentiated capabilities. Key examples of this include the move to Gate-All-Around transistors and Backside Power Distribution in advanced logic. Second, the PPACt playbook is inherently more complex, and we can help customers manage this complexity by providing more comprehensive solutions, which include integrated products and advanced services to accelerate R&D, technology transfer, ramp, as well as yield and cost in volume production. In parallel to the new PPACt playbook being implemented, we are also seeing regionalization of semiconductor supply chains, as countries seek to build resilient local capacity to support industry verticals that are essential to their economies. As a result, hundreds of billions of dollars of government incentives will be deployed globally over the next five years. At Applied, we recognized these trends early and made important changes to our strategy, organization, and investment profile. In the past five years, we created a dedicated organization to focus on the ICAPS market and released more than 20 new products for ICAPS applications. We also formed a team focused on co-optimized and integrated products to accelerate solutions for leading-edge logic and memory. This has resulted in much deeper strategic relationships with our customers, new highly differentiated products, and increasing market share. We developed a very strong portfolio of products to enable multiple generations of DRAM technology that is fueling share gains in this market segment and contributing to our outperformance. And we established a clear leadership position in heterogenous integration and advanced packaging. In fact, we just announced five new heterogenous integration products at SEMICON West in July. This strategy and increased focus on IoT and AI-driven inflections has enabled us to deliver more value to customers and strong performance in 2023, even during a period of very low investment by memory makers. It also positions us for on-going outperformance in 2024 and beyond. Let me highlight a few key areas. In DRAM, our revenues in the first half of 2023 were higher than our two closest process equipment peers combined. Our strength in DRAM is underpinned by multiple factors. We have gained significant share in DRAM patterning, both for EUV-based and multi-patterning. We have developed unique, co-optimized hardmasked solutions, which are a key enabler for capacitor scaling. We have successfully ported key technologies developed for logic to DRAM, where they are used in the peripheral circuitry to significantly increase I/O speed. And, we are the largest supplier of advanced packaging solutions with leadership positions in micro-bump and through-silicon via that enable multiple generations of high-bandwidth memory. As DRAM investments increase, we feel very positive about our opportunities, especially in high-performance DRAM for the datacenter. High-bandwidth memory is less than 5% of DRAM capacity today, but it is expected to grow at a 30% compound annual growth rate over the coming years. If you look at a HBM2 die compared to DDR5, it’s about 25% larger because of additional I/O routing and the area needed for the TSVs. On top of this, the extra processing steps needed for die-stacking further increase our total available market by approximately 5%. Another key growth driver is our ICAPS business. We see ICAPS demand as sustainable as these customers are delivering enabling technology for large, global inflections that will play out over the next decade. These include industrial automation, electric vehicles, and vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems, solar and wind energy, where each megawatt generated requires $3,000 to $4,000 of power chips, and the smart grid, which could drive $50 billion of annual silicon demand by the end of the decade. ICAPS investments are also expected to be underpinned by government support around the world, and we expect these markets to be a significant beneficiary of regional incentives. The increasing complexity needed to enable the PPACt playbook combined with a broadening of the industry's geographic footprint, are both key growth drivers for our service business. AGS delivered record revenue this quarter and is on track to grow in 2023 even with this year's low fab utilization rates and after absorbing the impact of new U.S. trade rules. This year, more than 60% of our service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. These agreements are growing at a faster rate than the installed base and have a high renewal rate of more than 90%. With strong customer pull for our services and a robust pipeline of new capabilities, we believe we're on-track to achieve low double-digit AGS growth in the coming years. While I am excited about the opportunities ahead, it is important to recognize that to deliver this future, the industry must also overcome significant challenges relating to complexity, cost and our combined carbon footprint. At Applied, we believe the way to do this is through closer collaboration and higher velocity innovation and commercialization of next-generation technology for energy efficient computing. In the past quarter, we announced two major initiatives: our EPIC platform in the United States and a Collaborative Engineering Center in India. These investments will support even faster and better relationships with customers, universities, suppliers and government partners to accelerate time-to-innovation and time-to-commercialization while increasing our combined R&D productivity. In addition, we are also driving a collaborative approach to reduce carbon emissions as the industry grows. In July, we rolled out our collaborative Net Zero playbook and we announced two major new products that help customers with carbon reductions: our Vistara platform, which lowers platform energy consumption by up to 35% and increases throughput density by as much as 30%, and EcoTwin, that enables customers to monitor, model and optimize chemical and energy consumption by tool and by recipe. Before I hand over to Brice, I’ll quickly summarize. Advanced chips are at the foundation of major global inflections and, as the IoT-AI era takes shape, it is driving a new wave of growth and innovation for the semiconductor industry. At Applied, we have focused our strategy and investments to deliver high-value technologies that enable key IoT and AI-driven inflections. We have strong leadership positions in ICAPS, leading-edge foundry-logic, DRAM, and heterogenous integration using advanced packaging. This strategy is enabling us to consistently deliver strong results in 2023, despite lower overall wafer fab equipment spending, and positions us for sustainable outperformance over the coming years. Now, Brice, it's over to you.
Brice Hill: Thank you, Gary. On today's call, I'll discuss the business environment, summarize our Q3 results, provide our guidance for Q4, and frame the investments we're making in our R&D infrastructure. Before covering the near term, I'll remind you of our longer-term thesis. First, we believe the semiconductor industry is on track to grow faster than the overall economy over time and reach $1 trillion in sales by 2030. Second, Applied's leadership in materials engineering is increasingly critical to our customers' roadmaps. Third, Applied's broad portfolio of differentiated products, balanced market exposure, and growing services business make us less volatile today than in the past and more likely to grow faster than our markets. And fourth, our efficient business model generates strong profitability and free cash flow, which enables us to both invest in profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns. Moving now to the Q3 business environment, we continued to see strength in ICAPS which largely offset weakness in leading-edge foundry-logic and NAND. ICAPS demand was broad-based, generating record revenue in 200mm systems and record revenue in Europe. In fact, the United States, Japan and Europe are the fastest growing ICAPS regions this year. Around the world, customers and governments are making long-term investments to ensure future supply of a wide range of semiconductors needed to support growing demand in key industries such as automotive, medical equipment and renewable energy, to name a few. Turning to our operational performance in Q3, our teams delivered strong results. We exceeded our revenue guidance across Semiconductor Systems, Services and Display. We improved our delivery performance in systems and services, and made further progress reducing inventory. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both the second highest in our history. Now I'll summarize our Q3 financial results. Company revenue was nearly $6.43 billion, down 1% year-over-year and in the upper end of the guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin was slightly above our guidance, and operating expenses were slightly below. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.90, down 2% year-over-year, and near the high end of guidance. Turning to the segments. Semi Systems revenue of $4.68 billion was down 1% year-over-year. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 34.8%. Applied Global Services generated record revenue of over $1.46 billion and non-GAAP operating margin of 29.3%. This was AGS's 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. While 200 millimeter system sales contributed to the growth, the team also made strong progress driving the leading indicators of our subscription business. For example, tools under service agreement are up 5% year-over-year to over 16,000 systems, and tools under comprehensive service agreement, which have the highest revenue per tool, are up 7% year-over-year, reaching 12,000 systems. In Display, revenue grew sequentially to $235 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 15.7%. Turning to cash flows, we generated $2.58 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, which was 40% of revenue. We produced over $2.3 billion in free cash flow, which was 36% of revenue. We distributed $707 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share buybacks. We paid $268 million in dividends and the dividend per share was $0.32, reflecting the 23% increase announced in March. We used $439 million to repurchase nearly 3.4 million shares at an average price below $130. Now, I'll share our guidance for Q4. We expect Q4 company revenue to be $6.51 billion, plus or minus $400 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $2.00, plus or minus $0.18. Within the guidance, we expect Semi Systems revenue to be around $4.75 billion. We expect DRAM revenue to be up by around $500 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by trailing-edge shipments. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.42 billion and Display revenue should be around $290 million. We expect Applied's non-GAAP gross margin to be about 47% and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.17 billion. We continue to model a tax rate of 12.3%. Finally, as we said last quarter, we plan to make a multibillion-dollar investment in new R&D infrastructure over the next several years to significantly expand our capacity to collaborate more closely and productively with our customers as we develop next-generation materials, process technologies and equipment. The scale of the investment will depend on our ability to secure government support. The EPIC Center is expected to come online in fiscal 2026. And while we expect our capital expenditures to be higher over the next several years, there is no change to our strong commitment to shareholder returns. In summary, Applied Materials continues to execute well. We are making good progress against our internal goals and outperforming our markets. While wafer fab equipment spending is lower in calendar '23, our Semi Systems revenue in the first three calendar quarters is trending slightly up year-over-year and our Services business remains on track for year-over-year growth. We've aligned our business with the fastest-growing end markets and are winning key decisions across leading-edge foundry-logic, DRAM, ICAPS and advanced packaging. We are in a great position to invest for technology leadership and growth, generate strong free cash flow, and increase shareholder returns. Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. Our goal is to help as many of our analysts as possible. With that in mind, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have another question, please re-queue and we'll do our best to come back to you later in this session. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the DRAM in the quarter and in the guide. So, DRAM in the quarter was strong, and you've got a lot of growth in the next quarter. You said it was mostly from trailing-edge. Am I right in reading that is primarily the Chinese customer driving that? And maybe you could sort of talk a little bit about your strength in China that is from DRAM versus foundry. It almost sounds like the DRAM piece is stronger than the ICAPS piece in China right now.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Stacy. Thanks for your question. This is Brice. Yeah. So, we highlighted in Q4 that we'll see sequential growth in DRAM. It is related to confirming technologies that we can ship to customers in China. We've gotten lots of customers about that -- or questions about that during the quarter. So, we wanted to make sure that people got that answer. So you'll see that growth in Q4. It probably won't be the only quarter we'll -- where we'll have shipments along those lines, but we wanted to make that clear on the trend quarter-over-quarter. And one more thing that I'd add, we think that's probably something that's not well understood by the investors that while the memory market has been weak for our customers, the DRAM market actually has been fairly strong this year from an equipment perspective, and this is just a continuation of that profile for us. So, we've got a good position in DRAM, and that is manifesting in Q4.
Gary Dickerson: Stacy, it's Gary. I'd add...
Stacy Rasgon: Is that -- go ahead. I'm sorry.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, maybe just, let me add some color and then you can ask the follow-on question. So DRAM, we've added about 10 points of overall DRAM wafer fab equipment share in the last 10 years. So, if you look at the big inflections in DRAM, the periphery moving to high speed I/O for high-bandwidth memory, we're taking logic technologies into DRAM. That's a really big driver for our share gains. Capacitor scaling is an area where we have strength, patterning share gains, advanced packaging, especially high-bandwidth memory. So, all of those areas are really big drivers for Applied and have contributed to this 10% overall WFE share gain in DRAM over the last 10 years. And then, you have another question, Stacy?
Brice Hill: Yes, I think I got it. Stacy -- yeah.
Stacy Rasgon: Yeah. I just wanted to follow-up on -- for the quarter, DRAM was pretty strong in Q3. Was it the same drivers?
Brice Hill: In Q3, there was a small amount of shipments to Chinese customers, so relatively small. Q4 would be larger.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you so much.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Stacy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus, I guess, on sustainability. You're talking about significant outperformance versus WFE here in calendar '23. And so, a two-part question. So, if you look out to the January quarter, representing calendar year, are you suggesting that you guys should be kind of in that flat to down 4% kind of year? And then, as you look to calendar '24, can you speak to, I guess, what kind of pent-up demand in terms of deferred revenues is helping this year that won't be replicated next year versus gains where you see leverage to the right end markets and/or new technologies that can drive relative outperformance? Thanks so much.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, C.J. Maybe I'll start with the 2024, because I think you were embedding a question there on, in '23, how much did we benefit from unserved orders in '22? We think that's about $0.5 billion to $1 billion. All of that was served in the first half of the year. So, what you're seeing from us in '23 besides that $0.5 billion to $1 billion is largely tracking with the business that we see, the WFE business that we see during the year. So, there shouldn't be an overhang. There shouldn't be a benefit from any previously booked business that we see now or going forward. And, as far as sustainability, that's one question we get regularly. The second question that we get regularly is just about ICAPS and the sustainability from China. And well, that's the most the largest country in ICAPS for China. It's not the fastest growing. That's sort of a -- that's a global trend and a global demand function. We see that as very sustainable. We think Gate-All-Around will start shipping in earnest in '24. We think our Services business will grow in '24. We think that the Display business will be a little bit better in '24. So those are kind of the bits that we've given for '24. Otherwise, we're not going to give a specific forecast yet for '24 or for the January quarter.
Gary Dickerson: C.J., this is Gary. Maybe I'll add a little bit more color. On the leading-edge foundry logic, what we see is more of that spending moving to materials-enabled technologies, which is the sweet spot for Applied. So, if you look at, again, the nodal spending more is shifting to materials engineering. Gate-All-Around, we've talked about, that's a $1 billion opportunity for us. Backside Power, when that comes in, that really leverages all of our strength in interconnect. And that's probably the same zip code in terms of size of opportunity for Applied. ICAPS, we've talked a lot about, formed the organization four years ago. We've introduced 20 major new products since we formed the organization. And we still have room to grow in ICAPS share. DRAM, I talked about. I think people really maybe don't understand the strength we have there. I talked about those big inflections in gaining 10 points of overall DRAM WFE share over the last 10 years. Packaging, that's a $1 billion business for us now, and we see an opportunity to double that over the next few years. And as Brice said, Services, we're going to be up in Services in a relatively weak memory market in terms of utilization, and we're still on track for low-double digit growth. So, again, those are some of the things that really will help us outperform over the longer term.
Michael Sullivan: Yeah. Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to understand what measures do you have in place to ensure that there isn't a pull forward of your mature technology shipments because of geopolitical reasons or because of take or pay arrangements? Do you have ways to measure the utilization of what you are shipping? And if I kind of just ask that same thing in a different way, do you think Applied will grow in line, above or below whatever WFE does in 2024?
Brice Hill: Hi, Vivek. Thanks for the question. I'll answer the second part first. So, we do think Applied will grow faster than whatever the WFE is for the market. And that's a good way to think of it, because we think of -- we think and plan for long-term secular growth, and we think we'll grow faster. On the question of pull forward, in specific to China, we've got many ways to test that equation. One of the things that we do is we look at the amount of local capacity relative to local consumption. We think that there's strategic direction in the country and strategic incentives in the country to make the investments that will at least equal local consumption. And we think those things are tracking together and can rationalize what they've put in place from that perspective. We also triangulate the overall capacity being purchased relative to semiconductor market itself. As you know, we test that with intensity and we make sure that equation makes sense to us. And then, from a micro perspective, we also look at the installation of our equipment. So, we make sure when it lands in China. We understand that it's installed, and then we track the utilization also at a macro level in the market. And we know that all that equipment is being installed and operated. And so, we don't see signs of unneeded or unwanted or unused equipment pulling up from that perspective. And we think the buys are rational at this point.
Vivek Arya: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Vivek.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar of Cowen.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I kind of have a two-part technology question for Gary. You spoke about high-bandwidth memory and how it's benefiting advanced packaging, which makes a ton of sense given the exposure to TSV, et cetera, but on the other side, it seems like hybrid bonding is slowing down, and some of your hybrid bonding customers are looking at things like thermal compression bonders. Can you give any color on that? And along the same path, Gary, you've spoken about Gate-All-Around being like a $1 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month incremental opportunity and 5 point share gains for Applied. You're there in most of those core technologies like epi, vertical epi, ALD, [Selective epi] (ph), et cetera. Are customers in Gate-All-Around making bundling decisions, or are they still going with best-of-breed solution? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you. Those are two big questions. Let me start off with high-bandwidth memory packaging. So that uses two critical packaging technologies, Through Silicon Via and micro-bumping to enable the stack DRAM. The great thing for Applied is that we have the broadest portfolio to enable all different types of packaging. CMP, PVD, CVD, etch and plating. So this opportunity for us is meaningful. The TAM for HBM increases about -- the overall packaging by about 5%. We're the overall leader in packaging. As we have talked about, it's a $1 billion business, and we're on track to double that over the next three to five years. So that's definitely a good opportunity. On the hybrid bonding, what I would say is that, we absolutely see hybrid bonding as a great opportunity over time. It's not something that is going to generate significant revenue in the short term, but chiplets are something that every single company is focused on. And I do believe all of the things that we've discussed relative to growth rates there, we're still believe that's on track. And then Gate-All-Around, the other question that you asked, we still see that as about $1 billion opportunity for 100,000 wafer starts per month. In FinFET, we had close to 50% share of that overall FinFET opportunity. We've indicated with the full adoption of Gate-All-Around, we have an opportunity to increase our share 5%. And I think one of the things that helps us a lot is that we're deeply engaged with every company in Gate-All-Around, even with their integration teams, because we have so many of those critical enabling technologies. So all the things we talked about back to our Master Class when we size that around $1 billion is basically still on track. And relative to ramping Gate-All-Around, we believe that is toward the end of 2024. Yeah. And then, well, the other thing is on the unit processes in IMS. There are some areas of that market where we're combining different technologies together under vacuum, which is something that's completely unique for Applied Materials that has a big impact on electrical performance. But the main message is we have very, very deep engagements with all of those integration teams and Gate-All-Around is pretty much on track to what we had talked about previously.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Krish.
Krish Sankar: Great. Thank you, Gary. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon, and thank you so much for taking the question. I had a follow-up on your ICAPS business, maybe for Brice. So, how big was ICAPS as a percentage of your business in the July quarter? Where do you see that going in the second half of the calendar year? And maybe more importantly, yourself and Gary talked about sustainability in the business. I think the rationale for China makes a ton of sense. How are you thinking about the U.S., Europe and Japan, where your customers, yes, they're strategic, but they also care about near-term profitability and returns. With some of the end markets slowing, is there fear that the non-China business within ICAPS could slow going forward? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Toshiya. Good afternoon. On the ICAPS, we haven't articulated exactly how big it is. What we've said is, this year, it's our largest market. It grew very strongly last year. It's growing strongly again this year. And we've said, over the longer term, as you think about the business, it's probably a third ICAPS, a third leading logic, and a third memory. And that's about as much. But you can get a feel for it. As we said all year, the ICAPS business growth has been strong enough to offset weakness in NAND and leading logic. So those -- that will let you probably get a ballpark. On the regionalization, we do think that regionalization leads to a little bit more spending, globally for ICAPS. But we also look and see whether that's a sustainable trend from our perspective. We look at the underlying businesses and the growth rates of all the device types that are being invested, whether it's China or whether it's the different markets across the world. And we rationalize that and we think all of the investment that's being made is consistent with the growth rates of those underlying devices and market. So 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% CAGRs for the different device types that fall into that, like, computer vision, analog, power chips, those sorts of markets. And then, on the last piece. So...
Michael Sullivan: Different geos and profitability.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. One thing I would say on the -- Toshiya, this is Gary. Relative to regionalization of the supply, one of the things that is extremely important is some of those ICAPS segments are tied to very large vertical markets in those different regions. So, having a secure supply chain is something that is a big focus for every country. There are hundreds of billions of dollars of incentives there for supporting those different ICAPS markets. So that's another thing that certainly we're seeing. And the last thing I'd say is relative to opportunities, the -- not only is it systems, but as companies are moving into new locations, that's a really great opportunity for our Service business, because there is no service infrastructure set up for those companies moving into new regions. And that certainly will help us. We're on track for the low-double-digit growth in our Service business, but the opportunity is supported by this regionalization.
Brice Hill: Good. And, Toshiya, yeah, I forgot the last piece of your question was on the business -- the health of the business today and whether customers are lowering starts or changing their plans. And that certainly happens in the environment. We've seen it, but I would just remind you, the way people are doing equipment investments, it's a two-, three-, four-year planning horizon. So they're really making investments for what the demand function they see that far out in time, and that makes their purchasing a little bit more stable than whatever the current demand function is.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you for all the color.
Brice Hill: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Team has been doing very well in process control. It's about 10% to 12% of your systems business. I think it grew above 55%, 60% faster than your overall systems business last year. Gary, you talked about strong technology inflections and benefits across the wafer equipment portfolio, but I'm assuming this is also pulling strong requirements for more and better process controls. So with that, I mean, can you just give us an update on process control portfolio? And how is that segment performing relative to your overall systems business this year?
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Harlan. Yeah, thanks for the question. So, PDC for us, there are really two major areas of focus. One is, as you've talked about, is growth within PDC, but the other thing that is increasingly important is the synergy with PDC and our process equipment, both for unit equipment and integrated material solutions, accelerating R&D for some of these major inflections. So, on the PDC growth, the business grew about two times between 2020 and 2022. eBeam is one of the fastest growing segments there. And we've maintained our leadership with around 50% overall share in eBeam. We have new products coming to market. We've talked about in our Master Class, the cold field emission with the highest resolution and fastest imaging. So that's helping that business growth. And then on the synergy, we had discussed the capacitor formation of DRAM where we're bringing new materials, new etching solutions together with eBeam technology, again, to accelerate those inflections nanosheets and Gate-All-Around. These technologies are incredibly complex. And you can't fix what you can't see. In our eBeam, imaging is world-class, ahead of anyone else. And so that synergy value is increasing. That will also help our growth in our market share overall in our semiconductor product group, but in PDC. So again, we're really in a great position, strong pipeline of products coming in PDC and great synergies with overall Applied.
Harlan Sur: Great insights. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Standby for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS Securities.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had a two-part question. First of all, Brice, can you give us a sense of, of the $1.7 billion that's in July for China revenue, can you tell us how much of that is domestic China chip makers versus other multis that might have fabs in China, but they're not domestic Chinese chip makers? And then the part two of the question is, how do you handicap the potential that this China [DRAMs pull in] (ph)? I mean, we have Micron that's been banned in China. We have a China memory maker now taking $500 million more worth of your tools in October versus July; that's $2 billion to $2.5 billion worth of extra WFE that's just in that one quarter. So, how do you handicap sort of how you run production factory? Do you count on that being sustained? Do you think that it's possible that it could be a pull in? If you can just comment on that? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Sure. Thanks for the questions, Tim. So, on the $1.7 billion for China, about 27% of our revenue, it's almost all. It's not a 100%, but it's almost all domestic Chinese customers; very little on the multinational, at this point. And then -- and just a reminder, it does include, a portion of our Services business. It does include a portion of our Display business in that number also. And then on the handicapping, whether it's a pull in for the traditional or legacy DRAM, I certainly don't think it's a pull in. This is a technology that was viewed as not being part of the rules where technologies were restricted for China. So, it's an existing technology. I think they'll put that equipment into operation as quickly as possible. And just in general, if we go up to 100,000 feet on this question, for equipment like that that's being installed in China, our view is that it's not incremental if it weren't allowed to be shipped there, that it would be shipped somewhere else in the world for production. So, we just view it as mainly location and we triangulate the amount of equipment we're selling against the overall demand function. So, we view it as location, not incremental.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, Brice. Thank you so much.
Brice Hill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo.
Joe Quatrochi: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. When we look at your ICAPS portfolio, how do we think about your technology leadership over some of the emerging competitors, and specifically in China, just given some of the comments around their efforts to localize their supply chain? I guess what other certain markets where you have broader leadership or more competitive advantage? I guess how do we think about that competition?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, thanks for the question, Joe. So I would say we're always focused on competition, even in non-critical process steps. And the main focus for us at Applied is to keep innovating in all areas of our portfolio and create deeper strategic relationships with the leaders in all device segments. In ICAPS, as we've talked about, four years ago, we formed that group, and this has paid off with share gains, helped us build deep strategic relationships with all the leading customers. And I'd say that those strategic relationships begin with the integration teams, whether it's in the leading edge or in ICAPS is super important, because those technologies are always moving very quickly and learning faster than others is really important. We've talked about in ICAPS, since we formed this group, we launched 20 major new ICAPS products. And I would tell you that we also have a strong pipeline of new innovations that will continue to strengthen our positions. The last thing I'd say in ICAPS is there are still -- again, we have the strongest strategic position, broadest portfolio. We're working with those integration teams on their next-generation technologies. But we also have room to grow in certain segments like etch and PDC. We have momentum in those segments, and that certainly is going to help us continue to gain share in the coming years.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, please standby. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I was surprised to see Services at a record level given the utilization issues in memory. Can you talk about that? And I mean, are you still -- are you seeing headwinds from the memory side that are incremental and you're just offsetting that with strength elsewhere? And kind of what does that tell us about where that business can go when utilizations come back up?
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Joe. This is Brice. So yes, the Services business, 16 consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. It was a record this quarter. And yes, the puts and takes there are that the transactional spares and the transactional activities that sort of are associated with utilization are significantly lower in the quarter. And then what we see that's higher in the quarter that drove that growth was really the 200-millimeter equipment. So, we talk about ICAPS growth and the strength of those markets. And the 200-millimeter equipment is really what's driving the significant upside in the Services business for the quarter. And then, on the second part of the question, incremental headwinds for memory. When we think about the memory market, there's been discussion of when will it be turning around and when will we see upside. The indicators that we follow, price, inventory and utilization, we still see trending in the negative direction or flat. So, we haven't seen a turn at this point. But we wanted to be careful to point out that in the DRAM market, we have seen strength this year. And it's sort of a normal year from an equipment perspective on the DRAM side, even though the memory market itself has been weak.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, Joe, this is Gary. I think the other thing to add is that part of our business is based on service agreements, and that also helps us have a higher level of stability. We're over 60% on the service agreements. And again, that's keeping that part of the business much more stable, even though the memory utilization is down. And the other thing I would say is that there is a significant amount of complexity. If you think about all the inflections, whether it's in memory with DRAM or ICAPS or leading-edge foundry logic, about a third of our revenue are these integrated material solutions with multiple technologies combined in a single platform under vacuum, those are increasing, those steps are increasing, and the service opportunity for us is also increasing. So, we've talked about the low double-digit growth in Service. Once you come back to more normal levels of utilization, and we have a high confidence we're going to be able to achieve that.
Joseph Moore: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin of Stifel.
Brian Chin: Hi, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Maybe firstly, it seems difficult to imagine AI not driving incremental foundry capital spending in the next upcycle. So, have you thought about how much incremental WFE spend in future years could result from AI-driven wafer start expansion?
Brice Hill: [Audit Starts] Hi, Brian, thanks for the question. We certainly have. When we think about the WFE share of the different end markets, data center has approximately 20%, we think AI is about 5% -- AI-related WFE is about 5% of our overall market. And you've heard different peers talking about a high growth rate bearing between 30% and 50% for that workload and the amount of capacity. So, if you view 5% as relatively small amount, we do think that it's growing rapidly and it’ll be an important workload going forward. So, that's our sizing for now. And as a comparison, we would hold that next to 10% to 15% of wafers that would be associated with IoT, and we think those things -- IoT wafer starts and WFE will also grow at an elevated rate.
Brian Chin: Yeah. Got it. That's helpful. And heterogeneous integration is sort of supplemental to that as well, right?
Brice Hill: That's right.
Brian Chin: And although it wouldn't be detectable from your results, did you see any pushouts from advanced foundry and logic customers? And also, when you think about the several domestic foundry shells that are either constructed or being constructed and ready to be filled, now until, I guess, into next year. What's kind of your current expectations for the timing and significance for some of those expansions?
Brice Hill: Yeah. There's still a lot of movement underneath the macro number in our results, there's still a lot of movement underneath as you're suggesting with that question. So, we have seen a delay in installation of some of the tools, and we have seen push outs with some of the leading foundry customers. So, that's consistent with what we're seeing. And then I would just highlight again the strengths in ICAPS and the strength in DRAM, both Q3 and Q4, our outlook is really what's offsetting that.
Brian Chin: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Thank, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Timm Schulze-Melander of Redburn.
Timm Schulze-Melander: Hi, there. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about longer-term R&D intensity. You mentioned about the higher CapEx for the EPIC R&D center and just thinking about the mix of the business, a third of revenues from ICAPS probably intuitively a lower R&D intensity. The other two-thirds leading-edge logic and memory, as you say, is more materials intensive and maybe higher R&D to sales intensity. Just wondering what we should expect the net of those two factors to be on a kind of multiyear view, please? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks, Timm. Well, our spending at this point is 18.1% of revenue. It's a little bit higher than our model, but we're very comfortable with our spending level. We put about 66% of our spending, two-thirds towards R&D. And we are fully focused on the roadmap. So when we think about the business, we think about the longer-term trajectory of the business. Our perspective is, we're investing in a secular positive trend. We think about semiconductors growing high mid-single digits, so 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%. We think there'll be -- it's becoming more complex to build those semiconductors, which drives more equipment, so that's an additive function. We also think that Applied, looking forward, designing for the inflections with our customers will gain share on top of that. So we think there's an additive function between the market growth of semis, the higher complexity of the equipment, and then the increased intensity from materials engineering and Applied's participation. So all those things add up to a significant growth rate. And so, what I would expect is, the spending level you see today will focus on maintaining approximately that spending level as we identify the best R&D projects to work on as we go forward. And then I would also highlight that just for investors who are working on their models, we've held our spending flat for pretty much three quarters and we said we've been very conscientious and very focused on strategic hires only. As we move to Q1, so the first quarter of our fiscal next year, we'll see our normal pay rate cycle, and we'll see our normal raise of spending in that cycle. So I just wanted to highlight to people that that's what they'll see if they're modeling that function.
Timm Schulze-Melander: Super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi of Needham & Company.
Charles Shi: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I want to ask, your largest customer in Taiwan talked about CapEx leveling off on a dollar basis. Wonder what's the impact that you might be seeing in terms of your revenue coming from that particular customer in 2024 and beyond. And any preliminary thoughts on the relative outperformance of WFE maybe in '24 by segment, meaning leading-edge, foundry logic, ICAPS, DRAM and NAND? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Charles. All I can say about any particular customer, but especially leading-edge customer is that we're current on their forecast. So, we understand at an account level what they're forecasting in the future. They've all started as we went through the supply chain crisis, we're getting better visibility into the roadmaps top to bottom. So, we have that -- we have a good perspective on that. In general, we haven't called a number for WFE in '24 -- for our business in '24. I just highlighted in the prior question that our view of the long-term growth of the market, sort of what guides our investments, et cetera. What we have said for next year is that we expect the ICAPS business to be stable. So that growth is durable, if you will. It's grown at a high level for the last two years, and we expect that business not to fall off, but be stable. We expect our Display business to grow modestly. We expect our Services business to grow at the low double digits as we've described. And I think that's the color that we've given so far for the market. That leaves out memory and leading logic, and we'll just have to wait until we get closer to give a forecast. [Audit End]
Gary Dickerson: Yes, Charles, this is Gary. Relative to longer term, as I mentioned earlier, we're in a great position. If you look at this incremental spending for the future technology nodes, a higher percentage of that incremental spending is going to materials-enabled technologies. And as I said, that's a sweet spot for Applied. Gate-All-Around, Backside Power, where you get power and performance benefits, but also you're going to get area savings with that inflection. So, we have been growing our position from -- for each technology node. I think that gets even better going forward.
Michael Sullivan: Yes. Thanks, Charles. And operator, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Yes, sir. Please standby. Our final question comes from the line of Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. This is [indiscernible] on for Sidney. And I want to ask about Gate-All-Around. Gary, you've been very clear about how big this opportunity could be, both in terms of revenue and market share. And so, maybe can you speak to the revenue contribution from this inflection in '24? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that we're not going to give a specific dollar amount. But what I would say is that, that inflection is just starting to ramp in the latter part of '24. So, it's not going to be a significant driver in '24, but certainly going forward, our opportunity there is significant.
Unidentified Analyst: That's great. Thanks.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Okay. Thanks for your question. And I'd like to just see if Brice, would you like to give us any closing comments before we close the call?
Brice Hill: Sure. Thanks, Mike. Just one content note that I wanted to add. So, we get a lot of questions about modeling gross margin, and I just want to highlight for the people that are doing their models. Our 47% guide for Q4, that's a little bit higher than what we would have expected with a rich mix in Q4. We're probably running underneath that at a normal mix around 46.6%, 46.7%, somewhere around that. So, as people think about modeling their next year, we think we'll continue to make progress from 46.6% or 46.7% to -- on our way to 48% to 48.5% in '25. So, if that helps from a modeling perspective, I just wanted to highlight that. From a closing comments perspective, we're executing well. We're outperforming our markets. The Semi Systems year-to-date revenue is trending up year-over-year. Our Services business is on track for year-over-year growth. We're aligned -- we've aligned our businesses with the fastest growing end markets, and we're winning in leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, ICAPS and heterogeneous integration. We're investing for technology leadership and growth. We're generating strong free cash flow and increasing shareholder returns. I hope to see many of you at the Jefferies Conference in Chicago, and Gary will be keynoting at the Goldman Sachs Conference in San Francisco. Now Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Great. Thanks, Brice. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by 5:00 Pacific Time today, and we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-05-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's second quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q filing with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On July 11th, Applied plans to host a Semicon West technology breakfast from 7:30 to 9.00 a.m., Pacific Time. We plan to announce a major new platform and lead a heterogeneous integration panel featuring executives from AMD, Intel and Qualcomm along with Besi and the EV Group. You can register by visiting the events page of our IR website. There won't be a webcast, so we hope you'll join us in San Francisco. And with that introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. Applied Materials delivered strong results in our second fiscal quarter, with revenues in the high-end of our guidance range. Across the business our teams are executing well, successfully managing a dynamic near-term environment, making progress with our longer-term strategic initiatives, and introducing enabling new products and solutions for our customers. Despite macro headwinds, our outlook remains favorable, and we expect to outperform our markets in 2023 thanks to our balanced market exposure, our strong position at key technology inflections which is driving demand for our differentiated products, especially in metal deposition, CVD, etch, implant, thermal processing, and eBeam, and our growing service business which is increasingly subscription-based. In my prepared remarks today, I'll cover our perspective on the market both the near-term dynamics and our longer term, secular growth thesis, how Applied is positioned to outgrow the industry this year and over the longer-term, and finally, the investments we are making to create more value for our customers and productively scale the company. In 2023, challenging and evolving macro conditions are impacting the semiconductor industry both negatively and positively. Demand that is directly driven by consumer electronics is clearly weak, while demand driven by inflections in technology and strategic regional supply-chain investments remains robust. This contrast can be seen in our customers' investment levels. Weakness in PCs and smartphones is a key factor for memory customers who have significantly reduced their investments in 2023. Measured as a percentage of total wafer fab equipment, memory spending is tracking at its lowest level in more than a decade. In leading-edge foundry-logic, we also have seen customers trimming their spending plans for the year. We see these changes as timing adjustments, as these companies remain fully committed to their long-term roadmaps to win the race for technology leadership in this market. Push-outs in leading-edge investments are being offset by increased strength from customers who serve the IoT, Communications, Automotive, Power, and Sensors markets. Over the past quarter, we've revised our 2023 ICAPS forecast upwards with demand being driven by two interconnected factors. First, ICAPS customers are delivering critically enabling technology for large global inflections that will play out over the next decade. These include clean energy, electric vehicles, and industrial automation. These inflections are driving significant innovation. At Applied, we have released more than 20 major new ICAPS products, since we formed our ICAPS group four years ago. Second, there is a clear trend towards regionalization of supply chains as countries seek to build resilient local capacity to support industry verticals that are central to their economies. We currently see around $400 billion of government incentives being deployed globally over the next five years, a significant portion of which will be directed towards ICAPS markets. While China currently leads in ICAPS spending, we see other countries increasing their investments at a higher rate. In fact, the fastest growing regions for our ICAPS business in 2023 are the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Looking beyond 2023, our long-term growth thesis for the industry remains unchanged. Semiconductors are the foundation of the digital economy, which is driving demand and puts the industry on a path to become a $1 trillion market by the end of the decade. At the same time, chip technology complexity is increasing significantly as traditional 2D scaling slows and the industry transitions to a new PPACt playbook to drive improved performance, power, area-cost and time-to-market. Increasing complexity means that wafer fab equipment can grow at a higher rate than semiconductor revenues and then, within equipment spending, major technology inflections are increasingly enabled by materials engineering, expanding the available market for Applied Materials. I'll highlight a few examples of how major materials engineering inflections contribute to our growth. First, Gate-All-Around transistors are a great example of a new 3D device structure that is enabled by materials engineering in areas where Applied has leadership products including epi and selective removal. In addition, we have developed differentiated conductor etch solutions specifically for Gate-All-Around applications. We expect shipments of our Gate-All-Around products to begin ramping in 2024 as leading customers move into high volume production. For Applied, this inflection creates an incremental opportunity of around $1 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts of capacity, and we expect to gain 5 points of transistor market share in the overall transition from FinFET to Gate-All-Around. Second, in wiring, we are seeing significant innovation in new materials. Adoption of new low-resistance metals for contact and interconnect enabled us to grow our PVD revenues at 3x the rate of wafer fab equipment in 2022. High-speed data connectivity remains a key focus for all of our customers fueling further growth at future nodes. Third, Applied technology is providing our customers with new tools to drive their scaling roadmap. Recently, we launched Sculpta, a breakthrough pattern-shaping technology which provides a simpler, faster, and a more cost-effective alternative to EUV double patterning. It decreases customers' capital cost by about $250 million for each layer of adoption per 100,000 wafer starts. We are already shipping repeat systems and expect this business to grow to multiple hundreds of millions of dollars of annual revenue in the next several years. The final example is advanced packaging. While we are still in the early phases of industry adoption, this inflection is already a great growth area for us. Our packaging revenue has doubled in the past three years to over $1 billion. We have strong leadership positions in key enabling technologies including Through-Silicon-Via, micro-bumping and hybrid bonding. We believe we can double revenues again in the next few years with further adoption of 3D multi-die packaging. The increasingly complex solutions our customers are deploying to move from one technology node to the next, are also a key growth driver for our service business. Customers are seeing value in our solutions to support their R&D, rapidly transfer and ramp new technologies, and drive device performance, yield, output and cost in high-volume manufacturing. Our service business is on track to grow in 2023 even with lower utilization rates in certain nodes and after absorbing the impact of U.S. export control rules. More than 60% of our service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. These agreements are growing at a faster rate than the installed base and have a high renewal rate of more than 90%. Given our confidence in the trajectory of the industry and Applied Materials, we are taking actions and making associated investments to support our growth, accelerate our customers roadmaps and drive productivity and efficiency as the industry scales. On May 22, we will formally announce a major strategic investment in a new high-velocity innovation platform focused on next-generation equipment and process technologies. As innovation in the industry is increasingly driven by new materials, structures and devices, our goal is to change the way we collaborate with customers, universities, suppliers and other partners to bring new manufacturing technologies to market faster and optimize the overall economic returns. We'll look forward to sharing more details next week. Before I hand over to Brice, let me quickly summarize. While 2023 is a challenging year for the economy and areas of the semiconductor market, Applied's business performance remains resilient thanks to our broad exposure to secular trends, strong product positions at key technology inflections, and our growing service business. Our longer-term outlook is very positive as semiconductors become a larger and more strategically important market globally, and industry trends create outsized opportunities for Applied. To position ourselves for the opportunities ahead, we are making strategic investments in R&D and infrastructure while driving improvements in productivity and speed across the organization. Now Brice, it's over to you.
Brice Hill: Thank you, Gary. On today's call, I'll summarize our Q2 results, provide our guidance for Q3, and discuss the investment we are making in our R&D infrastructure. Before covering the near-term, I'd like to remind you of four key points. First, the semiconductor industry is on track for secular growth, with expectations of a $1 trillion market by 2030. Second, materials engineering is increasingly critical to our customers' roadmaps. Third, Applied's broad and differentiated portfolio, market diversity and growing services business make us more resilient today than in the past and set us up to outperform our markets. And fourth, we have an efficient business model that generates strong profitability and free cash flow, which enables us to invest in growth and provide attractive shareholder returns. In fact, in March, we signaled our confidence in the long-term growth for the semiconductor market, and in our ability to deliver the new materials and manufacturing innovations required to drive the industry. The Board of Directors approved a 23% dividend per share increase which is the largest increase in five years and supplemented our share buyback program with a new $10 billion repurchase authorization. We believe our free cash flow can continue to grow and support increasing the dividend at an accelerated rate over the next several years which would double our previous dividend per share. As our services business grows along with our installed base of equipment, it alone produces more than enough operating profit to pay the company's dividend. Moving now to Q2 business highlights. Our team did a great job navigating supply and schedule challenges during the quarter, enabling us to grow revenue and earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. We mitigated most of the supplier cybersecurity situation we described last quarter, and this helped us deliver higher-than-expected revenue in both Semi Systems and AGS. Most of our businesses caught up to demand, and our lead times and inventory levels declined. Growth in our ICAPS business help to offset year-over-year declines in memory as it did in Q1 and our services business generated record revenue, growing year-over-year and offsetting headwinds created by the trade rules announced last October. Now I'll summarize our Q2 financial results. Company revenue in Q2 was $6.63 billion, up 6% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS was $2, up 8% year-over-year. These results were in the upper end of our guidance range and only slightly below last quarter's near-record results. Non-GAAP gross margin was flat sequentially at 46.8%, remaining resilient as we offset headwinds related to trade restrictions, inflation, supply chain and logistics. Non-GAAP OpEx rose slightly quarter-over-quarter to $1.17 billion. Turning to the segments. Semi Systems revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $4.98 billion. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 35.6%. AGS revenue grew 3% year-over-year to nearly $1.43 billion. In fact, this was AGS's 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Segment non-GAAP operating margin increased sequentially to 29%. In Display, revenue was approximately flat sequentially at $168 million and segment non-GAAP operating margin increased sequentially to 12.5%. Turning to cash flows. We generated $2.3 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, which was nearly 35% of revenue. We produced over $2 billion in free cash flow which was nearly 31% of revenue which demonstrates the efficiency of our business model. Shareholder returns in the quarter were over $1 billion, including $219 million in dividends and $800 million in share buybacks. Now, I'll share our guidance for Q3. We expect company revenue to be $6.15 billion, plus or minus $400 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.74, plus or minus $0.18. Within this guidance, we expect Semi Systems revenue to be around $4.5 billion, which is down nearly 5% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.43 billion, which is up 1% year-over-year. Display revenue should be around $170 million. We expect Applied's non-GAAP gross margin to be about 46.3% and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat sequentially at $1.17 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 12.3%. Finally, I'll comment on the new innovation platform Gary discussed in his remarks. We are planning to make a multibillion-dollar investment in new infrastructure over the next several years to significantly expand our capacity to collaborate more closely and productively with our customers as we develop next-generation materials, process technologies and equipment. We'll provide more details about the amount and timing next week. What I'd like you to know today is that the investment is consistent with our company's existing long-term strategic plans. Also, the scale will depend on our ability to secure government support. While we expect our capital expenditures to be higher over the next several years, there is no change to our longer-term financial model and our strong commitment to shareholder returns. In summary, Applied Materials is executing well and demonstrating the advantages of our broad and diverse portfolio, markets and customer base. This year demonstrates how our business has become less volatile and more resilient. We are growing year-over-year in semiconductor systems and services and generating healthy profitability. We are in a great position to invest for technology leadership and growth, generate strong free cash flow and increase shareholder returns. Mike, please begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have another question, please requeue and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.
Christopher Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. So I was hoping you could speak to the sustainability of spending for lagging edge in China. There are many players that I think we're all aware of, like SMIC, Huahong, Huali et cetera. But it sure sounds like there are 20, 30 emerging new players that are in their first three rounds of DC funding. And the question we get often is, how sustainable is that spending beyond 2023? So we'd love to hear the visibility that you have to their build plans and how you're thinking about that spending beyond this year? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Great. C.J., thanks for the question. We've looked into this ourselves quite in-depth. We're very bullish and the customers are bullish about the end markets that are driving the investments that are being made in China. So specifically, we've looked at the equipment that we're selling. We've looked to see that it's being installed. We've looked to see that it's actually being ramped. And that's what we do see in China. So people have asked us about, is there pre-ordering or stocking of equipment? We don't see that. You're right, that it's mostly ICAPS and it's mostly focused on the end markets that we all know that are growing in the power markets, the video processors, the sensors and power, those types of end markets. We also think about the government incentives in China. So a lot of – there is a long tail of investors in China. They are being incentivized, but they are ramping and installing the equipment, and we don't see any unused areas. Anything to add there, Gary?
Gary Dickerson: No. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess to follow-up on that, I know you said that like the non-Chinese regions are growing faster, but is that because just they're smaller, like how big, how much like even qualitatively is China as a percentage of your total ICAPS revenue? And like, how much is the China piece of it growing relative to those other regions that are growing faster?
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks, Stacy. It is the largest country in the ICAPS space, but I think there are three other countries that are growing faster. And it's not because it's a lot small numbers. They're pretty significant. So if you think of North America, China, Europe, people will recognize a lot of the investments that are being made in the mature technologies in those spaces. So China is not the fastest grower, but they're the largest country. And when we look across the world and we look at all those investments, there are government stimulus programs that help encourage the customers to make those investments. But we believe there's real demand behind that. When we look at utilization in the ICAPS space, we see utilization to be in a healthy range. So this looks like an ongoing trend when we think forward. If we look back to 2022, we had 40 plus percent growth rate in ICAPS. It's only accelerated this year. And our view from all the accounts is that it won't grow at the same rate. It won't accelerate at the same rate, but that demand is stable. We expect over the coming years that that market will stay about the same size.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Stacy, this is Gary. Especially, I would say in the U.S. and Europe, when I talk to those CEOs and those companies, they're in a very strong position. And those investments that they're making will be sustainable over the next several years, and they are, as Brice said, meaningful.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Stacy.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for the question. Maybe kind of two very related ones. What's your backlog in Semi Systems? And where does it get to exiting the year? And then a number of your peers have suggested that the second half of the calendar year, so essentially your Q4 and Q1 could be better than the first half. Is that similar to the trends Applied is seeing? Or what would create that difference between you and your peer group?
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Vivek. First of all, backlog. We still have an elevated backlog. What we've tried to talk about last quarter and this quarter is the dynamics under that. We have caught up in most of the business groups to the underserved demand that we had from the prior year. So that's a good thing. Our lead times are returning to more normal. Having said that the backlog is still elevated, we think that's because many customers are placing orders over a longer period of time. They're planning longer in the future than they have in the past. So when you see our backlog published at the end of the year, it'll probably still be at an elevated level. On the second half, we're not guiding the second half, but the story for Applied has been that the ICAPS business has grown so much this year that it's offset weakness in the memory market and any slowness that we've seen in the leading logic market and we expect that dynamic to continue. You can see in the next quarter that we don't have growth in the next quarter. But overall, we expect that dynamic that we've seen for the business to continue in future quarters. So we can't call that second half or even 2024 yet because the large markets of memory and leading logic are pretty exposed to macros and pretty exposed to consumer end markets. We'll just have to see how that looks for Q4 and for next year?
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Vivek.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Krish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had a big picture, and a quick clarification for Brice too. One is for Gary. When you look at all these leading-edge spending and all the regionalization, it seems like, is it all tied to really CHIPS Act funding or other factors in play like a permitting orders might be that's causing some relative delay in those leading-edge investments? And Brice, did you say anything about some of the China export control recovery that some of your peers have spoken about in the back half? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Krish, thanks for the question. On the leading-edge, there is an intense competition for leadership, so all of those companies are trying to drive their road maps as fast as they can on power performance and cost. So we certainly see that continuing to play out over the next few years. What I would say also is that the perspective that we have right now is that 3-nanometer is going to be a big node, where there's a lot of tape-outs and customer demand. So we think that's going to be pretty robust. For Applied, we're in a really good position as our customers move to 3-nanometer. The number of steps for us go up I think to more than 20% in that transition from 5 to 3-nanometer. Again, you have this really significant competition in that leading-edge that – again, we continue to see that that's going to be sustainable going forward. And then relative to government incentives, there's also a lot of competition there. So you see every region where we do business today a significant amount of incentives that are being supplied really for leading-edge and for ICAPS. But I think that – so that's definitely true. That will be an adder for our systems and service business over the next few years. But I think the bigger factor in the leading-edge is just there is pretty significant demand and you have significant competition for leadership. And I'll let Brice answer the next question.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Gary. And Krish, on the China export controls, we see the same thing as our peers do. We'll be able to ship to some factories in the second half that were clarified recently.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thank you, Krish.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question, please.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Gary, I have a question on your comments on Gate-All-Around. You talked about gaining 5 points of transistor share from FinFET to Gate-All-Around. My question is the share gain, is that because the TAM is growing? Or are the dollars coming out from other areas like lithography? And does that statement include contribution from Sculpta?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question. So I would say Gate All Around, there's both higher process complexity of existing steps plus addition of new steps. And we've said that's again a $1 billion opportunity for Applied, and we're really in a great position because the steps that are growing, the increased complexity is in areas where we have very, very strong products and technology. And again, we're deeply engaged with every single one of those companies. So in any of those areas for deposition, selective removal, we have very good visibility relative to overall competitive positions and not just in the first generation of Gate All Around, but subsequent generations. And so again, I think we still see the same thing relative to the size of the market and the share gains really are relative to FinFET. So what customers were spending for the – we're spending as a percentage of total transistor from FinFET to Gate All Around. That's where the 5 points of share comes from. And then relative to the road maps going forward, what I would say is that we definitely see an increasing relative contribution in materials engineering. So if you look at certainly the transistor innovation, wiring resistance is one of the biggest issues in the whole industry. That's an area that's growing very fast. I talked about the MVP growth earlier. So again, that wiring is a really great opportunity for us. Backside power distribution will be coming. There you can get up to 30% area savings without changing the feature size and also improvements in power and performance. In the future, you'll see people stacking nanosheets for another transistor technology in future nodes. So again, more and more of those dollars are moving to materials engineering as we go forward.
Michael Sullivan: All right. Thank you, Atif.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your question, please.
Mark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, for you. You guys seems way ahead of the curve on ICAPS. It's been a phenomenally successful investment for you guys, it's really paying off. On these calls, you always talk about all these other investments that you made, I think you went through three, four or five of them. Which one of those has the chance to be the biggest? Is there – does one of this have a chance to be the size of ICAPS right now? How should we think about the next big driver for you guys, if you were to single out one, if you could. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: So Mark, just – thanks for the question, but I just want to understand, are you talking about within ICAPS or are you talking beyond ICAPS.
Mark Lipacis: Beyond ICAPS, all the things that you guys are investing in right now, you guys – you made a great decision to invest heavily in ICAPS and is paying off in a major way. So that was a press on investment from my view, and I'm trying to understand like you're making a lot of investments. You talk about a lot of things that you're investing in. Of the four or five things that you talked about on the calls that you've been investing in, do any of these have the chance to be as big as ICAPS? Or what has the chance to be as close to ICAPS in terms of the amount of revenue and profitability it could deliver to Applied Materials. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Okay. Yes. Thanks, Mark. I would say two things. One, as customers are going forward, I mentioned this on the previous question. Materials engineering, I think if you look at the percentage of spending going forward, just really tremendous – everybody knows that 2D Moore's Law scaling is challenged. And so the innovations in – transistor innovations in wiring, innovations and memory technologies, all of those areas – and I mentioned the increase in the number of steps and the increase in complexity from one technology node to the next, we're in a really great position, again, relative to what's going to drive our customers' road maps in the future. And there's tremendous innovations that will bring there. Sculpta was one example of another way that you can achieve area scaling at a much, much lower cost with this directional etch technology and there's many material modification steps, double-digit numbers going from one technology node to the next that are growing, those are areas where we have extremely high share. And we're innovating to drive performance and power and cost for customers. So that would be one area I would say. The other one that I'm pretty excited about longer term is packaging and all the innovation is going to happen going from system-on-chip to system and package. I think that's going to be a tremendous inflection. That's about a $1 billion business for us today. I mentioned earlier that we could see that doubling in the next few years. I think that – and there's – we have a very strong position in the served markets that we have today. We have pretty high share. And there are other areas we're focused on. We mentioned hybrid bonding as one, but there are others that we're focused on that will create really big opportunities. So that would be the other area. I think that, that whole movement to chiplets and heterogeneous integration.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Gary, I had a question on your memory business. Clearly, it's going through a pretty rough patch at the moment, consistent with industry trends. I'm curious both in terms of your AGS business as well as your systems business, at what point do you expect your memory business to recover. I know you're pretty close and you're going back and forth with CEOs and CTOs. But just curious on the timing there. And as a quick follow-up, your business in Korea in the quarter was quite strong, if I'm not mistaken. Korea, obviously over-indexed to memory. So I was hoping you could reconcile the weakness you're seeing in memory, but the strength in Korea. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yes. Hi, Toshiya, it's Brice. I'll just say a couple of things, and Gary can add on that. So on the memory side, we do think it's at sort of historical lows. We've thought about our long-term balance of memory and logic over time. We do think the market from an equipment perspective should be about one-third memory and two-thirds logic and that two-thirds would be split between relatively evenly between ICAPS and leading-edge. So on the memory, we do think it's at a low. However, in the quarter, we monitor pricing, we monitor utilization, we monitor inventories. Those are still moving in the wrong direction in this past quarter. So it hasn't quite turned yet, but we do think with the ICAPS business growing and with an outlook, long-term outlook strong for leading-edge, we do think memory will have to turn around. It's hard to call the exact moment, but we expect that to happen. And then Korea, I think it's just good shipments in the quarter. I don't think it portends anything unique from a trend perspective. We do still see weakness in the market.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Brice, I don't really have too much to add. Again, we do see long-term foundry-logic. We've mentioned this before, two-thirds, one-third, certainly continuing strength in the race for leadership and the leading-edge and sustainable strength in ICAPS going forward. We don't think it comes back to that two-third, one-third soon. But longer term, that's kind of where we think that's going to end up.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thank you, Toshiya.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
Harlan Sur: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Typically, doing periods of spending weakness, you start off with the first couple of quarters, driving a lot of customer push-outs rescheduling, cancellation activity, then that activity stabilizes and your shipments soon follow that stable trend. I know last earnings, you were still seeing quite a bit of rescheduling and push-out activity on the backlog. Has this activity stabilized?
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Harlan. Thank you. I don't think so. We still saw in this quarter, we still saw weakness in NAND, and we saw weakness as defined as push-outs on the leading-edge, and that's partly why you see our guide for the next quarter, a little bit bumpy, taking into account some of those push outs. So I think customers are still reacting to the current environment and checking the road maps and trying to optimize those road maps. And for us, just to sort of reiterate, over the course of this year, the ICAPS business has been so strong that it overcame most of that noise. The growth of ICAPS overcame most of that noise. Plus we had several business units that we're still catching up on back orders. The first part, the ICAPS strength, we expect to continue as the year goes on, as we've said, and be a important component of demand going forward. And the business units that were behind have mostly caught up with the exception of implant, where we're still working to catch up.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Hi. I just kind of wanted to go back to this China lagging-edge topic. And you guys do such good demand modeling. And I'm kind of wondering what you think the underlying demand that's kind of backing all this. The kind of easy conclusion is that this just all kind of coincided with the leading-edge bands, and so they're just pivoting to pouring money into a lagging-edge. So when you think about the demand backing this, was this just demand that like wasn't being met by the U.S. and the European chip guys? I asked because EV is not new and penetration is actually pretty high in China already, and it haven't been great anyway. So that's the first part of the question. And then also, is that really like this year WFE thing? Or is it all more going to be part of next year's WFE? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Okay, great. Thanks, Tim. The second part of the question first. So we definitely think it will be a continuing trend. So we raised our expectations of demand in China during the quarter, and we raised our expectations over time from China during the quarter. And as I – I may have said in the first question, when we track fab projects in China, there's quite a number. The overall list for the globe is approximately 100 now, and there's a significant amount in China. So when it's mostly in the ICAPS space. And when we think about the end markets, I guess the perspective I have is that they are localizing as much of the supply to these ICAPS end markets as they can. And so they are building local supply for if you think of sensors, power chips, analog chips, microcontrollers, we believe they're building out those capabilities internally, and I think there's been confirmation recently that some of the imports of those components to China have declined even though demand is growing. So our perspective is the capacity that's being put in place in China, it isn't extraordinary at this point. If you think of China trying to build a local ecosystem of capacity that matches their demand function, if you will, over time. They're not there yet. So these investments make sense if that's the goal, and we know they have government incentives to accomplish that.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, Tim, this is Gary. One other thing I would say is – and we do, as you said, a lot of modeling of each one of those vertical markets within ICAPS. We look at fab utilization, wafer starts, all of those things. The one other thing, I would say is that we look at good chips out for each one of these different factories. And so when you look at yield as another factor that's – when we look at the overall market, it's roughly in line with what we see relative to our assumptions of the growth rates in those different segments. But again, I would look at also the good chips out.
Michael Sullivan: Yes. Thank you, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Joseph Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And kind of as a follow-up to Gary's comment, I guess, how do we think about, if you were to look at like domestic China's capital intensity for mature nodes relative to maybe some of your more experienced customers, is that a multiple higher than your more experienced customers? And I guess, how do you think about that kind of normalizing over time?
Brice Hill: Yes, I can start, Joe. The capital intensity, since it's mostly ICAPS, what we see in ICAPS is the capital intensity is sort of like leading logic was five or eight years ago. So that whole discussion about there being a lack of reuse, especially in China, those are mostly greenfield sites. They are new equipment sets. So the capital intensity is fairly high. And we think that's consistent by the way with most of the ICAPS additions going on across the globe. And that's a major factor as to why overall intensity as we measure intense WFE intensity to semiconductors is going up over time as the fact that ICAPS is so much higher.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Sidney Ho: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the AGS business. Gary, you talked about AGS still growing this year despite the many different headwinds. And if you kind of just look at the upside and the AGS in the quarter, can you speak to what drove the upside given the underutilization across foundry-logic and memory. And then also I want to ask about how do you expect the segment to perform in the second half of the year, now that all the memory suppliers have been taking down the utilization – and is there a range of AGS growth we should be thinking about this year? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question. So AGS, if you look at the way that business breaks out – about 85% is spares and service. And a significant percentage over 60% is long-term agreements, subscription types of agreements with a length of 2.6 years. We're still seeing very, very high renewal rates. So one thing that helps us in this type of market environment is a lot of that business is still based on those longer-term agreements. So that's helping giving us a level of stability in this type of a market. And then the other part of AGS, kind of mid-teens is the 200-millimeter business, that's really focused on ICAPS. And that business is very robust. So I would say that our business, again, relative to the agreements, pretty stable, continuing to grow, strong renewal rates. And then the 200-millimeter business is also very stable and growing in 2023. I don't know, Brice, if you want to add anything else?
Brice Hill: I think that's a major thing, and we've said that we expect it to grow for the year. So it's growing year-over-year, and we expect it to grow for the year. And our outlook does include you see it slower growth in Q3. So our outlook does assume that there'll be lower utilization in some of the factories. So we've accounted for that Sydney, but we do expect it to grow year-over-year.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. And I guess the other thing I would add is that we – certainly, we're growing this year. And we still we're still on track to this model that we had talked about a couple of years ago with low double-digit growth for AGS longer term.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thank you, Sidney.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.
Brian Chin: Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Yes. I guess sort of doubling back on sort of ICAPS for the year. Obviously, it's almost like a one-for-one offset to some of the industry weakness in memory and advanced logic foundry. But I guess can you talk maybe to linearity a bit? Because you have talked about how back maybe the backlog did increase this quarter, but still at pretty robust levels. Lead times have sort of normalized. And I think the expectation was that there'd be a little bit of a gearing towards the calendar first half in terms of that business. So I'm kind of curious how you see that still for calendar second half, and whether some of this China that's been discussed is part of maybe a wildcard relative to how you view that second half?
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Without getting specific about trends quarter-over-quarter, it has been gradually increasing. So – if we look back to, I think, Q3 of last year, Q3, Q4, Q1, Q2, I think we have an increased trend across each of those quarters. And so we're not going to guide the second half, but I don't think there's I don't think there was a front-loaded phenomenon in ICAPS.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Brian, the other thing I would add is that implant, as Brice mentioned earlier, is one of our most supply-constrained businesses. We have very significant demand. We've launched around 10 new products and ICAPS over the last few years. So that business is going to continue to ramp through the year as we close that supply/demand gap. So that is a significant portion of ICAPS, an area where we have real strength with the customers, the demand there for the inflections is very strong. So again, that's another factor driving our ICAPS strength.
Brian Chin: Okay, great. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham. Your question, please.
Quinn Bolton: I guess I have a clarification and a question. Just a clarification on the China export clarifications that we received. I think some of your larger cap peers have talked about benefits of $200 million to $300 million in the second half. You have higher market share I think in China, can we expect that those export clarifications probably have at least a $300 million benefit for you in the second half?
Brice Hill: Hi, Quinn, since it's a small number of customers, we're not going to be specific about the number, but we definitely see the same situation. We have factories that we will be able to ship to in the second half. And at least for Q3, that's in our guide.
Quinn Bolton: Okay. And then the question just with the ICAPS strength and relative weakness in advanced foundry-logic. I think you've talked about ICAPS being about half foundry-logic. I assume for 2023 that's probably more than half of the business, but wondering if you might be able to give us a range where you think ICAPS falls out for 2023, given the relative strength?
Brice Hill: Yes, it is larger. The growth has been significant, both last year and this year, as we talked about, and we think it's stable. And then the only thing we've really guided is long-term, we think foundry-logic is a little bit weakened this year. So we think that gets in more of a balance in the long-term on the logic side of WFE. So long-term, we would say it's relatively equal. This year, ICAPS is the largest market.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Quinn.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your question, please.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, thanks for letting me ask a question. Maybe just a follow-up on that last one. I was curious at the leading-edge. If you could just walk us through the extent of the pushouts and really just trying to figure out, you're still seeing quite low utilizations at the leading-edge. Some of the markets may recover in the second half. But I'm just kind of curious your visibility into when that leading-edge segment may rebound?
Brice Hill: Hi, Blayne. For the low utilization, it is relatively low. I think it's – for leading-edge factories, I saw somebody quoting around 70%. I think that's probably a good range right now for leading-edge. And the pushouts are really site-specific and project-specific I don't think they sense or signal a change in direction of any of our customers in terms of their intent to build out new process technologies. And what's ahead for us that's most important is this transition to Gate-All-Around, and we think that will start in earnest as we get into 2024, and that's one of the big inflections that we think will drive value for Applied. So anyway, that's what I would say on the pushouts.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, Blaine, I would say that a couple of things. One, the 3-nanometer, we still – everything that we see – that's going to be an important technology node. And so certainly, next year, we think that's going to be a meaningful contribution to revenue for Applied. And then as Brice said, for Gate-All-Around, we'll see the initial ramping of that spending in a meaningful way also in 2024.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks, guys.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Blayne.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question, please.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. Hi, Gary and Brice. Just a quick question on the government funding. I know you mentioned $400 billion. How much do you expect that to add to global WFE if you look at 2023 or second half, 2023 or 2024?
Brice Hill: Hi. Thanks, Vijay. That's the right number, global phenomenon, as you talked about. The way we think about it is it will add about 3% to 7% of WFE over the next five years. We don't think $400 billion will be incremental WFE. What we think it does is set the locations, our customers will be putting their assets in place. And because some of those locations will be new, you won't have quite the economies of scale as they might have in their larger facility areas, and that will drive a small amount of incremental equipment since there's a little bit less economies of scale. So we estimate that to be 3% to 7% over the next five years. And then in the very short-term, we do see companies that are starting to accrue for some of the tax benefits were included in that group. So I think the incentives are already starting to encourage investment.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then on the China side, would it be fair to assume that next year ICAPS continue to hold up, but might be memory spending could be down again year-on-year for China?
Brice Hill: On the ICAPS side, we do expect it to hold up. And then memory. I think memory is more market-driven. So what we're seeing for both the memory and the leading-edge logic for next year. It's going to be more dependent on macro and some of those consumer markets. So TBD on that piece.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your question, please.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thanks for giving me a chance. Two questions. For Brice, I'm just trying to better think about earnings given opportunities with ICAPS and other areas. And in that context, should I assume that like if I were to use FY2022, WFE was close to $100 billion. And you guys did almost 793quarter in earnings. In looking forward, can you hit those kind of revenue targets without having WFE well above 90 billion? And then for Gary, I understand the government incentives so that is very good for the equipment industry. But in the longer term, don't you think that these subsidies could make the cycles actually more volatile? And perhaps I could reference what happened the past few years, demand got pulled in? And then we had some correction in SEMICON? And I just want to understand how you think about the subsidies in the context of form of the cycle or shape of the cycles and volatilities?
Brice Hill: Hi, Mehdi. On the earnings question, I think if I understand that, yes, $90 billion would support larger earnings as we go forward because our AGS business will continue to grow. We expect upsides in our display business as we go forward. So if you're looking to model those, I would look at modeling the continued growth in AGS and thinking about upsides in display on top of where we are today. And that should give you a perspective on if there's no growth in WFE where the model could get to over the next couple of years? And then, Gary, on subsidies.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. I think that Brice talked about 3% to 7% Mehdi incremental spending over the next several years. Certainly, there's a tremendous amount of competition between different geographies. But customers, we think, will invest based on where they see the demand – so the timing of those investments, I don't think they're going to be significantly different than the way they thought about it in the past. The one thing I would say that should be a benefit is that as these companies move into new regions and they're starting up new factories, the initial efficiency of those factories is going to be lower. For sure, as they're moving into the new locations, and that's also incremental help for our service business because they don't have all the trained personnel and all of the infrastructure in place in those new locations. So anyway, that's the way we think about it.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thank you, Mehdi. And operator, I think we have time for one more question or a follow-up, please.
Operator: Certainly then our final question for today is a follow-up question from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I had a question on the investment plans that you're going to be talking about next week. I know you gave us the details then, but I was wondering if you could give us just a little bit of a bread crumbs here on what the purpose of this is you talked about gains in the Gate-All-Around like five points. Do you need these kind of investments to get those market share gains? Or is this something that kind of gives you an edge like into the second half of the decade, with like resources and support that you can offer that others are not going to be able to offer. Just anything you could tell us in advance of maybe the details next week, that would be helpful?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Stacy, thanks for the question. So what I would say is that one of the most important factors for any company is the time to innovation, time to commercialization and innovation success rate. So we've been – and as you know, it takes many, many years from concept to high-volume manufacturing. And that's somewhat of a serial process. And so working with some of our largest customers, we think there's opportunities to drive some of those steps in parallel and significantly accelerate time to innovation. So that's what we're going to be talking about next week. It's really exciting. Again, I definitely do think there's opportunities there. And I do believe that materials inflections, new structures, some of the things I've talked about that's going to be a bigger and bigger percentage of gains. Some of our big customers talk about design technology co-optimization, becoming a much bigger part of their roadmap for energy-efficient computing. So I think, Stacy, we'll cover more of this next week, but we have been working with our largest customers on some of these concepts. And I definitely think there's ways to accelerate innovation. And as you know, if you think about how much money companies spend on each R&D dollars on each technology node, there's a tremendous opportunity for economic optimization, both on cost and then value creation. Anyway, we'll cover more of that next week. And then we will also cover this at the SEMICON event that Mike talked about earlier.
Stacy Rasgon: So is this just like a new maiden fab? Or is it more than that?
Gary Dickerson: I'd say it's more than that. The concepts, certainly, the scale of what we're talking about is pretty significantly bigger than what we're doing today. And the concept of how we're going to work through the entire ecosystem, I think, are pretty exciting.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator:
Michael Sullivan: All right. Thanks, Stacy for your question. Brice, would you like to help us close out the call today?
Brice Hill: Thank you, Mike. My takeaway today is while there are areas of weakness in our markets this year, Applied is making good operating progress and outperforming the markets, thanks to our unique breadth and diversity. We're confident about the industry's long-term growth opportunity, and we're in a great position to make significant investments in our future and increase cash returns to shareholders. On Monday, we look forward to detailing the strategic investment we're making to collaborate closely and productively with our customers that Gary just described. Gary will see many of you at the Bernstein Conference in New York on June 1, and I hope to see you at the BofA conference in San Francisco, June 7. Mike, please go ahead and close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Brice. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of today's call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by about 5 o’clock Pacific Time, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-02-16 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining Applied’s first quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that today’s call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied’s most recent Form 10-K filing with the SEC. Today’s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today’s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. Later this month, Applied Materials is participating in the SPIE Advanced Lithography and Patterning Conference. For those who aren’t traveling to San Jose for the conference, we plan to hold a new product launch event on our IR Website on Tuesday, February 28th at 9 am Pacific Time. We hope you’ll join us. And with that introduction, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. Applied Materials executed well in our first fiscal quarter, delivering results towards the high end of our guidance range. We also grew our backlog for the ninth consecutive quarter. Going forward, we expect backlog to start declining as we move through 2023. Overall, we are making good progress closing our supply-versus-demand gap. However, very recently, one of our major suppliers encountered a disruption that will impact our second quarter shipments. Brice will provide more details about this when he shares our guidance. In my prepared remarks, I will cover three main topics: Our current outlook for 2023; our longer-term growth thesis for the industry, and how Applied is positioned to grow faster than our markets overall; and finally, a brief overview of the investments we are making to productively scale the company and accelerate our customers’ roadmaps. Let me begin with our near-term perspective on the market. In this environment of mixed macroeconomic signals, our customers are facing a variety of demand dynamics. Consumer-driven markets, including PCs and smartphones are clearly weaker, while inflection-driven markets remain more resilient, especially high-performance computing and AI, automotive, industrial automation, and clean energy. In terms of wafer fab equipment investments, 2023 will be a down year for memory spending as customers rebalance inventories and defer capacity additions in both NAND and DRAM. We expect DRAM to pick up ahead of NAND, potentially beginning to recover later this calendar year. We now see leading-edge foundry-logic spending being slightly down year-on-year. While near-term demand headwinds are causing customers to trim capacity additions, they remain firmly committed to strategic investments in advanced nodes to win the battle for next-generation technology leadership. Our view of ICAPS, chips for IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensor applications, is incrementally more positive than it was last quarter, and we now see spending being up year-on-year. Leading ICAPS companies are investing in both technology and capacity to serve growing demand across a wide range of verticals. In addition, there is strong government support around the world to build resilient, regionalized ICAPS supply. Based on what we are seeing in our business and hearing from our customers, we believe Applied Materials is well positioned to outperform the market in 2023. The resilience in our business is driven by several contributing factors: First, our balanced market exposure which allows us to perform well in a variety of spending mix environments. Second, our position with technology leaders who remain focused on investing in their long-term strategies. We have strong positions at all the key technology inflections in advanced foundry-logic, ICAPS, DRAM, and advanced packaging. Third, our record backlog, of which a significant percentage is made up of our most differentiated products including metal deposition that is uniquely enabling for critical next-generation wiring resistance improvements. And finally, our service business which is on track to grow in 2023, even after the impact of current U.S. export control regulations. More than 60% of our service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. These agreements have an average tenure of 2.6 years and a high renewal rate of more than 90%. While we are cognizant of near-term volatility in our markets and ready to respond to both upside or downside, our long-term outlook remains highly positive. Semiconductors are the foundation of the digital economy making them more strategically and economically important than ever before. Around the world, governments are incentivizing the industry to build regional manufacturing capacity and accelerate investments in strategic next-generation technologies. The semiconductor industry remains on track to grow from approximately $600 billion in 2022 to a $1 trillion or more by the end of this decade. Technology complexity of chips is increasing significantly as traditional 2D Moore’s Law scaling slows and the industry transitions to a new PPACt playbook to drive improved performance, power, area-cost and time-to-market. In addition, as 2D Moore’s Law decelerates, we are seeing average die sizes in advanced foundry-logic grow. This drives the need for additional wafer capacity while also accelerating the transition to chiplets and heterogeneous designs. Beyond advanced packaging, major technology inflections in transistor, wiring, and patterning are also enabled by new materials and materials engineering. These inflections increase the size of Applied’s available market. As we have been investing in these inflections for multiple years, we are now well positioned to capture a larger share of our available market. We have a deep pipeline of solutions to enable new wiring innovations, Gate-All-Around transistors, backside power delivery, heterogeneous integration and hybrid bonding. Our broad portfolio of products enables us to offer customers traditional unit process equipment all the way to integrated materials solutions, or IMS, that combine multiple process technologies with on-board metrology and advanced data analytics in a single platform. We are very confident about the growth trajectory of the industry and Applied’s outperformance within that environment. To support this growth, we are making strategic investments in new manufacturing, logistics and R&D infrastructure. The scale, speed and location of these investments will be dependent on receiving government support, some of which we have already secured. Beyond simply expanding capacity, we see these infrastructure investments as a catalyst to change the way we collaborate with customers, suppliers and research partners. For example, in the coming months, we expect to break ground on our next-generation R&D center in Silicon Valley. We believe this new high-velocity platform will increase innovation and commercialization speed while reducing the overall cost of bringing new manufacturing technologies to market. As the industry and Applied Materials scale, we need to do so productively and efficiently. This is a major strategic theme for us and, across the Company, we are focused on driving up productivity and implementing new ways to work that are better and faster. Before I hand the call over to Brice, let me summarize. While the economy and semiconductor industry are facing challenges in 2023, we remain confident that Applied is well positioned to outperform our markets this year. Our resilience is underpinned by our large backlog of differentiated products, growing service business, and strong positions with leading customers at key technology inflections. Our longer-term outlook remains highly positive as secular trends create opportunities for Applied to outgrow the semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets by enabling the PPACt roadmap with our differentiated portfolio of materials engineering solutions. In line with this view, we are making strategic investments in R&D and infrastructure, while driving improvements in productivity and speed across the organization. Now Brice, it’s over to you.
Brice Hill: Thank you, Gary. I’d like to start by thanking our team and our supply chain partners for helping us deliver strong revenue in a dynamic environment. On today’s call, I’ll summarize our Q1 results and provide our guidance for Q2. Before going into the near term, I’d like to discuss the broader context for the industry and the Company. Over the past few cycles, the semiconductor industry has become significantly larger and more diverse. Applied’s revenue and earnings have grown and become more resilient over this period. In Semiconductor Systems, more than half our revenue comes from leadership businesses where our market segment share is near or well above 50%. The growth of our services business has added another dimension of stability. These factors strengthen our confidence in our ability to invest, generate high returns, and return capital to shareholders. Our business model is very efficient and generates attractive returns. In fact, from fiscal 2013 through 2022, we have grown Applied’s free cash flow at a compound annual rate of 30% and increased our return on invested capital to over 35%. We have three capital allocation priorities. The first is funding future growth and returns, and the second is maintaining a strong balance sheet so we can fund R&D through market cycles. Accordingly, even though the semiconductor market is weaker this year, we are investing to scale the Company to support our customers in what we believe will be a trillion-dollar semiconductor market. We are increasing our manufacturing and logistics capacity, and we are making significant investments in our R&D infrastructure to collaborate more closely and productively with our customers and industry partners to help solve their highest-value problems. Our third capital allocation priority is returning excess cash to shareholders. We have committed to return 80 to 100% of free cash flow, and actual returns for the past 10 years have been 106%. We have repurchased 40% of shares outstanding at the beginning of this period. As the business has become larger and more diverse, we’ve also increased the dividend. We’ve increased our quarterly dividend per share at a 14% CAGR over the past 17 years. In fact, operating income from our services business alone more than covers a growing dividend. Finally, I want our investors to know that we are increasingly focused on improving our productivity. We increased our full-time employee base by around 20% last year and have restricted hiring to critical positions and slowed our spending growth. R&D is our largest expense, and we are making portfolio decisions to ensure we generate the highest possible returns from our investments. We also see opportunities to make our manufacturing more predictable and efficient, and have formed new teams to drive our operational goals. Moving now to our Q1 financials, we delivered net sales of nearly $6.74 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.03. These results were in the upper end of our guidance range and nearly identical to last quarter’s record results. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 80 basis points sequentially to 46.8%, primarily driven by improved manufacturing and logistics costs along with pricing adjustments. Non-GAAP OpEx was nearly $1.17 billion, with about two-thirds of the sequential increase from R&D. Turning to the segments, Semi Systems revenue grew by 13% year-over-year to $5.16 billion. Strength in ICAPS more than offset reductions in memory and advanced foundry-logic. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 37.3%. AGS revenue grew nearly 4% year-over-year in Q1 to approximately $1.37 billion. AGS absorbed a full quarter of revenue impact from U.S. trade regulations and performed better than the midpoint of our expectations. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28%. In Display, revenue declined to $167 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 4.8%. Turning to our cash flows, we generated $2.27 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, which was 34% of revenue. We returned $470 million to shareholders including $220 million in dividends and $250 million in buybacks. Now, I’ll share our guidance for Q2. We expect revenue to be nearly $6.4 billion, plus or minus $400 million, or up over 2% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.84 plus or minus $0.18. This guidance includes a negative estimated adjustment of $250 million related to a cybersecurity event that was recently announced by one of our suppliers. Based on our current assessment of the situation, we expect to recover all of this revenue, and the majority of it in Q3. We expect Semi Systems revenue to be about $4.84 billion, which is up over 8% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.34 billion, which is down around 3% year-over-year including the negative impact of recent U.S. trade regulations. Display revenue should be around $160 million. We expect Applied’s non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46.5% which is lower quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by lower volumes and higher near-term supply chain logistics costs, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.16 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 12.5% and a weighted average share count of 850 million. I’ll close my remarks today by saying thank you to our long-term investors for your support. We are investing for the future with confidence. Our products and services are being directed to a semiconductor industry that is growing in size and strategic importance to the global economy. Our business model is highly efficient, with low capital intensity and a high return on invested capital, driven primarily by R&D spending deployed in close collaboration with our customers. Our business has become less volatile and more resilient as semiconductor demand has broadened to more markets. Equipment capital intensity has recovered and our services business has grown larger and more subscription-based. In fact, over the past five fiscal years, we’ve increased non-GAAP net income by 87%, generated $18.7 billion in free cash flow, and returned 118% of free cash flow to investors. Looking forward, we believe the growing complexity of the semiconductor roadmap and our ability to deliver the innovations required by our customers will enable us to grow faster than the industry. We plan to expand our global R&D and manufacturing infrastructure, including the plans Gary previewed. Finally, we will focus on increasing our productivity and maintaining our efficient spending model. Now Mike, let’s please begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today’s call. If you have another question, please requeue and we’ll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let’s please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse: I guess I was hoping to get a little more color on the backlog side of things. To what degree do you think dollar-wise that will kind of contribute to you here in calendar ‘23? And as part of that, I guess, how are you thinking about kind of first half versus second half, whether on a fiscal or calendar year basis, kind of silicon trends as that backlog unwinds? Thanks so much.
Brice Hill: Okay. Great. Hi C.J. And thanks for the question. So on our backlog, just taking a step back, we did see a lot of activity with movement in orders during the quarter. As we’ve described before, we go through our orders each quarter, work with the customers to update them. And there was a lot of movement. We do see the weakness in the market that everybody else sees in the leading edge, logic and in memory. But as Gary pointed out, we did have strong bookings in the quarter and our backlog actually grew. We think that more than half of that backlog would be executed this year. And as Gary also pointed out, we expect that we’ll begin to work that down toward a more normal level as we start to improve supply chain and be able to ship the demand that we’re still shipping from last year, really, we’re still working in some of our business units to cover the demand that we had last year. So, it has been a little bit of a buffer, the strong backlog against the weakness in the market for us, and we think it’s going to take the rest of the year, probably 1 to 4 quarters, depending on the business unit, we’re thinking about to work through to normalize the lead times and recover the backlog that we need to ship against.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. C.J., one other thing I would add is that the largest part of our backlog is with our leadership products, especially MDP and implants. So again, that gives us strength as we go forward.
Brice Hill: Yes. And C.J., we’re not giving the guidance for the second half, but we’ll just say that as I highlighted, more than half of that backlog is in the year, so it’s definitely helping the year. It is buffering us Q1, Q2. And it does give us confidence that we had strong bookings in the quarter. And we’ll probably talk more about this, but we’ll highlight that the ICAPS markets are very strong. In fact, demand has been accelerating in those markets.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon: I actually wanted to dig a little bit into that strong ICAPS demand. Is it coming from -- I mean, is it focused in areas like China where at this point after the restrictions they’re going to be forced to take a much harder look at their efforts in trailing node versus a leading node? And I guess, as an add-on to that, are you concerned at all about the strength in ICAPS? Is there any concern about overbuild, I guess, as we go through the year, as that gets built out?
Brice Hill: Hi Stacy. Thanks for the question. First of all, it’s broad-based, I guess, would be my first answer on the ICAPS. We had significant growth last year that we highlighted when we did our year-end call, and it’s actually accelerating into this year. So I’ll come back to whether that’s a concern or not. China is the largest region and the largest single country driving ICAPS. So, it is a focus area. We’re actually not concerned that it’s going to be affected by trade regulations. So, that’s not on the radar screen at this point. As we think about ICAPS and we think about that broad-based strength, you’re probably aware or certainly aware that many of the companies that we know are leading ICAPS manufacturers have announced that they’re adding capacity, and the capital intensity for those companies is increasing. And I think it just is a reflection of there’s little used factories and used equipment available in the market. And so, as companies need to add capacity to serve this market, they’re having to make the new investments. We do think it’s sustainable. We do think it’s being driven by, in some cases, are being supported in some cases by government incentives. But we’re not concerned that companies will put capital in place that they don’t plan to use. We don’t think the incentives are enough to have somebody install equipment and not use it just in the hopes of using it. So, we’re also fairly confident in the underlying demand, things like electrification, electric vehicles, sustainable power. All these types of markets we think are sustainable. So we just -- we’re seeing an acceleration in that area for our business, and we think it will continue.
Gary Dickerson: Stacy, the one thing I would add too is if you remember, several years ago, you had a lot of used equipment as the foundry business model was emerging. So that really depressed capital intensity for a number of years. And of course, that’s not happening now. So capital intensity is up, and our position there is very good.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya: I’m curious, does your Q2 outlook kind of reflect the trough of memory demand, or you think there is a lot more memory weakness that you could see in the second half? Because it’s just that when I look at your outlook, right, it seems to be very different than what we have seen from your other U.S. peers who are down 20%, 30% sequentially in their calendar Q1. And I don’t know if it’s just the ICAPS strength that explains that delta. So, I’m just puzzled as to what explains that outperformance. Is it ICAPS, is it something else? Or have you not yet seen the trough of memory weakness and that is still to come that maybe they saw it earlier, and you could see more of it in the back half? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Thanks for the question, Vivek. We’re fairly confident that we’re current with our memory customers on their orders. We’ve definitely seen -- as I highlighted in our booking activity, we definitely have seen significant cancellations and pushouts from memory customers. We think we’re current. Mathematically, you’re exactly right. The acceleration in ICAPS has more than offset the weakness we’re seeing there and any slowdown we saw in leading-edge logic. So, that’s true. And then, we’ve looked at the leading indicators on the memory side. We’re still seeing pricing declines. We’re still seeing inventory increases. So, we don’t think it’s turning yet, at least from our perspective, but we’re confident we’re current with the customers, Vivek.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen.
Krish Sankar: Brice, maybe just one for you. I notice you did not quantify WFE for this year, and I understand you’re probably better than the industry because of the ICAPS strength. But it seems like the range is anywhere from 70 to 75 and some people talk about $80 billion in WFE this year. But just hypothetically speaking, if WFE is down 20 or so more percent since you’re going to outperform, is it fair to assume your revenue growth to be down more like low to mid-teens? And kind of how to think about the earnings power in that scenario given that you’re trying to be disciplined on OpEx? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks Krish. So yes, we didn’t provide a WFE because we’re really just trying to focus on sharing what we’re seeing, all the signals that we’re getting in the market because we’re a little bit abstracted from it. As you pointed out, we’ve got the strength and acceleration in ICAPS that may make us a little bit different. We’re also still shipping orders we had from ‘22. So for us, we’re catching up to demand, especially in some of the key differentiated business units that existed before the year. So, it’s not a perfect match, and it’s difficult for us to estimate. Switching to OpEx. As we talked about in our last call, because we were supply constrained, our OpEx growth, that was our plan, was a little bit ahead of our revenue growth. So, we have implemented headcount targets. We’ve moved to strategic hiring only, and we do have initiatives focused on improving our productivity on spending. So we’re conscious of that. Of course, it’s a balancing act, Krish, through this year because we think the industry is growing. We’re confident in the direction we need to continue investing in R&D. So that’s our primary goal is to deliver those programs to customers. We have flexibility, if the environment deteriorates for us, then we’ll make more appropriate changes to spending. But right now, we’re comfortable with the trajectory.
Operator: Next question coming from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Nice job in the execution. So, Brice, it does sound like ICAPS is the driver for your outperformance at least in the near term versus the peers. And historically, in your Master Classes, you have talked about ICAPS being around 25% of your silicon portfolio. And I’m curious where do you think you’re running this business at right now? And if you could comment on within ICAPS is auto or silicon carbide the strongest area for you? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks, Atif. Yes. I think that we’ve characterized foundry logic as two-thirds of the business last year. Memory is a little slower this year, so that mix is changing a little bit. And we characterized our lagging edge or the ICAPS portion as about 50-50 with leading edge. So that’s the way we characterize it. And that’s all thinking of it from a TAM perspective. What we are seeing at the company level is that the ICAPS market is accelerating and growing at a very high rate for the Company this year. And we think part of that is driven by government incentives and part of that is driven by the higher intensity and part of that is driven by the strength in the end markets that I highlighted. And maybe, Gary, on the silicon carbide, you could make a comment.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Let me just give a little bit more color. So, ICAPS relative to market share is similar for us with leading foundry logic. So, we’ve grown share in ICAPS a significant amount over the last few years. It’s also accretive to our overall gross margins. Four years ago, I think we’ve talked about this, we formed the ICAPS IoT, communication, auto power, sensors, organization because we could see these markets were going to grow at a significant pace. So we pulled together a really strong team. We have the broadest exposure. If you look at all of the technologies, whether it’s in -- again, any of those different segments within ICAPS, we have significant strength. So again, that’s something that we saw several years ago and made investments. So, we have many ICAPS specific products. Implant is one area if we look at. There’s many areas where we have strength and broad exposure in ICAPS. But in that particular area, we’ve introduced 10 new products focused on ICAPS in the last five years. That is the largest segment of our implant business. And just in that one area, again, we’ve been very supply constrained, we expect that we can double our ICAPS revenue in ‘23 versus ‘22. So again, just really across the board we have very, very strong positions. And pulling that organization together four years ago, really put us in a good position for what we’re seeing today.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I had one quick clarification and then a question. Gary, you just mentioned that you expect your ICAPS revenue to double in ‘23 versus ‘22. Was that overall ICAPS, or was that just implant? That’s my clarification question. And then my question, Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your DRAM business potentially recovering by the end of the year, which to me is a little surprising, just given how weak the trends are in that marketplace today and the inventory situation. Can you kind of share what informs that view in DRAM? And what are your thoughts on NAND as well? Thank you .
Gary Dickerson: Okay. Let me cover the -- first question is on the doubling of ICAPS. That’s specifically implant in ‘23 versus ‘22. And part of was just the supply chain challenges that we had in ‘22 that limited our output. So, that’s what’s happening there in -- with ICAP. And Brice, do you want to cover the DRAM NAND question?
Brice Hill: I think in the DRAM and NAND, we have seen the weakening in memory. We do expect that next year will improve on the memory perspective. I don’t think, Toshiya, we’re going to give an exact moment when the market will turn. I mentioned earlier, we kind of have three signals that we can look at internally. We can look at utilization for both NAND and DRAM. And we see utilization lower this quarter and all of our customers are forecasting utilization to be even lower next quarter. We’ve looked at the pricing of memory, and it looks like it’s either declining or declining -- or slightly flattening. And then we’ve looked at inventories and it looks like inventories are still growing. So I don’t think at this point that we can say, call the point in time where memory starts to grow. But we do expect next year that memory will improve and companies will begin to invest again. And it’s just difficult to call that moment.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: Brice, I had a question on backlog. It seems like backlog is sort of skewing your numbers a bit higher than your peers, given how long your lead times began or got to during the upturn. So, I’m wondering if you can give us maybe a few more breadcrumbs on the backlog. I think you said last quarter, SSG backlog was $12.7 billion. So I just want to be clear that the SSG backlog went up from that number. And if so, that’s kind of like 2.5 quarters of backlog for SSG. And when I think of a normal, you always used to run more like a quarter-and-a-half worth of SSG backlog. So, is it right to conclude after all that that you maybe have a quarter’s worth of excess backlog right now as it relates to SSG?
Brice Hill: Yes. I think -- thanks, Tim, for the question. So color on it, I would say we did see weakness in leading logic and memory as we described. So, a lot of the strength that we’re seeing comes back to this acceleration on the ICAPS side. So from a mix perspective, I think that’s where a lot of strength in the orders is coming from. And Gary highlighted the growth of implant. So certainly not -- the growth of total ICAPS is not 100%, but it is very meaningful to us for the year, obviously, enough in Q1 to offset weakness in memory and leading logic. So, that gives you some of the perspective. Most of this is in the semi business. Some of it’s in 200-millimeter, which comes in the AGS space. And what I would say is, yes, it does tie back to the long lead times in the areas of the business that are highly differentiated equipment, where we’re still working off that backlog. And we think it will take us -- I guess what I would say is -- last quarter, we highlighted that a normal backlog would probably be in the $12 billion or $13 billion range. We expect to work back in that direction as supply improves, and we can start catching up to the demand we had from last year.
Timothy Arcuri: So I guess, Brice, just to confirm, so the SSG backlog did go up from $12.7 billion?
Brice Hill: I’m looking at the data, Tim, to see if I can see this. Can you see it? Yes, sir.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, maybe one thing I would add that just kind of gets back to a lot of the questions. We do have strength in many of these key technology inflections. We talked in the Master Classes about inflections gate all around, wiring, memory with capacitor formation or new materials, PDC strength. We had that Master Class in December. So that’s another thing. When you look at the composition of the backlog, just again, wiring alone, we have one inflection that enables a 50% reduction in resistance. The dollar per wafer goes up about 3x from 7 to 3-nanometer. So, those areas are also helping us in relative performance.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur: Given the unprecedented sort of excess inventory situation in the memory space, your memory customers are being very disciplined, right? They’re taking drastic actions to rein in supply, even going so far as to push out their technology migration road maps. Typically in downturns, we wouldn’t see your customers pulling back on tech migrations, capacity add, yes, but not tech migration. So, is the tech migration pullback in the associated higher capital intensity a big contributor to the WFE pullback this year in memory? And just as importantly, does this mean the potential for a sharper spending recovery as memory fundamentals start to normalize because all of your memory customers are going to try to aggressively get realigned on their tech migration road maps.
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. I’ll start, and Gary will probably want to add something here. I don’t think that the inventory situation in the current market is guiding their technology transition choices. I think that will be driven by their opportunity to take leadership positions and improve the cost of the bits and improve the product performance, et cetera. So, what does happen is they may have more equipment that they can reuse into their road map depending on what demand is. So, they’ll make changes and lower their equipment buys based on that. So, I think -- I’m not aware of companies for -- that are connecting the technology ramp decision with the current inventory situation and business situation.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Harlan, I would say that your view of memory strengthening, we said DRAM potentially by the end of the calendar year and memory strengthening into ‘24, we would share that perspective. What I would say is that we are -- we also believe that foundry logic will remain strong going forward. It was in this kind of two-thirds, one-third mix between foundry logic and memory. And especially with government incentives, you see a lot of government incentives certainly in the U.S., in Europe, Japan, a number of different areas, potentially in India. That could add a few billion dollars per year in additional investment. And again, the profile of higher foundry logic versus memory, we think that’s going to sustain for a number of years going into the future.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.
Joe Quatrochi: I wanted to ask about the backlog fulfillment kind of working that back down to more normalized levels or at least 50% of that kind of where you’re at today. How do we think about that from your ability to increase production supply versus your orders maybe slowing from your customers. I guess, how do we split that out in terms of understanding what’s driving backlog there?
Brice Hill: It was a little hard to hear the second part of that question. But let me start with working down the backlog, Joe. Thanks for the question, Joe. So I guess the way we’re thinking about it, it’s hard to estimate the order flow coming in and estimate the exact backlog number. But we’ve got several business units that are still shipping against demand really that we received last year. And it has been supply constrained. It’s -- we’re behind 1 to 4 quarters depending on the business unit that we think of. So we think as supply has improved, we’ll begin to ship back against last year’s orders and recover to a normal position. And the quickest business unit, we’ll probably do that in the next quarter. Then we do have one or two business units that will take into next year to be able to recover that. I don’t know -- go ahead and -- Joe, can you say the second part of your question, again. There was some line noise kind of blocked it.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. I apologize. The second part is just trying to understand the other piece of aside from supply is -- are you predicating on orders being resilient to take that long to get back down to a more normalized level, or are you expecting orders to maybe slow?
Brice Hill: I think we’re not really -- I guess I would say we’re not really expecting orders to slow. Like I said, we’re current in the environment. And so, as we think towards next year, we expect ‘24 to be a better year across the whole industry, memory, leading logic, et cetera. So at some point, we expect there to be stability in the market. We saw strong orders this period. I can’t predict if it will be strong every cycle. But as we head towards ‘24, we think there’ll be firmer footing.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: You guys talk about leading-edge foundry and logic spending down slightly this year. I was just hoping that you can double-click on that a little bit. Based on your business, how do you see the ramp of 3-nanometer production, say, by the end of this year as compared to maybe years past for leading edge? And also, how does that compare to your expectations maybe 3 to 6 months ago? And maybe you can talk about transit outside of 3 nanometers, that would be great. Thanks.
Brice Hill: Okay. I’ll start on that one, on the leading-edge. So I think it’s pretty straightforward. The largest leading-edge customers are running at lower utilization at this point. And so, they’re resizing their capital buys as they look at the utilization level that they are now. So, we’ve seen pushouts or cancellations of some tools related to those customers. And I think it’s pretty straightforward. They have lower utilization and they have the ability to reuse some of that equipment into their next ramp. And then, I don’t think we typically comment on the timing of the other nodes. But Gary, do you want to make a comment about 3-nanometer?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. What I would say is that from what we’re hearing from customers, the demand for 3-nanometer is very strong. And that looks like that’s going to be a very big investment for our customers. And again, for us, the positions there, we’ve covered that in a lot of the Master Classes, we expect our share of gate-all-around to rise versus FinFET, about 5 points. And we have the majority of the spending in that inflection. I’ve talked about those wiring inflections where the dollar per wafer goes up significantly from one technology node to the next. And again, we’ve covered those in the Master Classes. So, our position at 3-nanometer is very strong. Our position gets stronger even in 2-nanometer as customers are driving improvements in power and performance. So, our position there is very good. And again, what we’re hearing from customers is significant demand for 3-nanometer and then the timing, we’ll let them comment on the timing.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham.
Quinn Bolton: Just hoping you could help reconcile something for me. Obviously, it sounds like the ICAPS business is very strong in 2023. You said China is the biggest part of ICAPS. But when I look at your China revenue, it looks like it’s down 40% over the past year from about $2 billion to $1.15 billion. So just trying to reconcile that the slower pace of revenue in China versus the ICAPS strength you’re seeing. I guess, is that ICAPS strength really coming from non-China regions, or do you expect a nice recovery in China as you come through 2023? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks, Quinn. The strength in ICAPS is broad-based. So, it is growing worldwide, but China is the largest country, and most of the demand that we see in China is really ICAPS-related because the memory investments and leading logic investments are essentially zero or close to zero. That’s where most of that investment is.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. I would say that relative to ICAPS profile in ‘23, China is remaining at a similar level. But there is growth, significant growth in the other regions. So, I think your assumption is pretty close to what we see.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.
Mehdi Hosseini: I have one clarification and one follow-up. The $250 million that is pushed out to the July quarter, could that potentially help with a rather stable SSG revenue trend? I’m just trying to get a feel for how the $250 million pushout could impact SSG two quarters out. And then, would you be able to help me understand how big is ion implant within ICAPS?
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks, Mehdi. I’ll take the -- I’ll take the $250 million. So, we do expect -- none of that demand is perishable. So yes, in your model, I would take that $250 million and add it to whatever you’re modeling for Q3. We don’t know if we’ll get exactly all in Q3, but we think we’ll get it most in Q3 based on our current assumptions. And then, to the extent that there’s weakness in the second half, if there is, then it would offset that to a degree, just like you’re describing.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Mehdi, relative to ion implant [Technical Difficulty]
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, I’m just trying to understand how big is ion implant within ICAPS.
Gary Dickerson: [Technical Difficulty] Sorry. Sorry, I didn’t push the button. So, relative to implant ICAPS, we haven’t quantified the amount -- the size of that business. But it is the largest segment within implant, Mehdi. And we -- and as I said earlier, that we believe that we can double that, roughly double that implant ICAPS revenue from ‘22 to ‘23. We’re the leader in that segment, and it is significant. But we have really broad exposure across multiple products within ICAPS. As you know, it’s not really shrink-driven, it’s more materials and structures-driven market. We’re the leader in that market, and we expect that will remain strong in ‘23 and going forward.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel.
Brian Chin: Maybe just in terms of the backlog discussion, I guess it sounds like -- is there a disproportionate amount of the backlog that is geared towards ICAPS, and that’s really even net of pushouts or cancellations that may be happening in memory, for example? This is really I guess, the main reason why your revenue is as resilient in terms of near-term shipments, kind of the net product is just beneficial. Is that the right way of thinking about it generally?
Brice Hill: Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. I do think it’s fair. I didn’t parse backlog in exactly the way that you described. But to your point, we’re seeing significant strength accelerating demand from our ICAPS customers that’s filling in blanks that we get on the memory or leading logic side. And so to the extent that that -- our backlog represents the orders that we’re shipping, I think it’s fair to say that there’s a significant amount of ICAPS strengths across that backlog. So, I think that dynamic is fair. And just going back to those end markets, we do think it’s sustainable. We don’t think the strength is anything unusual or driven by any unusual activity. We don’t think companies are putting in capacity that they won’t use. This is just growth that, as Gary said, that we’ve seen coming for a while and it’s starting to build out, and you might have seen some of the big -- larger companies in the ICAPS space talking about these investments. So I think you’ll see it pretty much across the globe.
Brian Chin: Great. And I imagine some of those cylinders aren’t even firing at the moment, too. So that’s probably not bad as well. Thanks.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you. And operator, we have time for two more questions, please.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
Blayne Curtis: Just curious the message on overall foundry logic. So clearly, ICAPS is up. I’m just trying to understand if you could just talk about what’s kind of the trends have been in leading edge. And I think some has kind of talked about it being kind of slightly down for the year as a market. Just kind of curious what you’re seeing. You talked about it getting a bit weaker on leading edge. Can you just clarify how much it has? And just walk us through kind of last couple of months in leading-edge foundry.
Brice Hill: Yes. Blayne, I think slightly weaker, we won’t give an exact number. We may not see the exact number either. But, when we look -- when we think about the big customers in foundry logic, that everybody knows, they have had reductions in our capital plans. When we look at leading foundry logic, when we look at utilization, it is low at this period of time. So their customers, our customers’ customers are working through inventories at this point in time. But when you start to turn the page, the leading logic is going to invest in the next nodes and put that capacity in place. They may have a little bit more equipment available for reuse but they’re going to make those investments. And we expect that and we see that coming through. And so, we’ll -- when we get past this year, we’ll expect to see strength in foundry logic again. Gary, do you want to add anything to that one? Okay. We’re good. Thanks for the question, Blayne.
Operator: And our next question coming from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Group.
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. Hi, Gary on Brice. Going back on the backlog again, I think you mentioned your backlog is current. Does that imply that the memory exposure or memory within that is fairly small given all the cancellations? And then a follow-up.
Brice Hill: Hi Vijay. I don’t know if -- first of all, it’s current. We’ve definitely gone through and made changes to the backlog based on our current customer situations. Whether we have more exposure or not, it depends on how things go. The macroeconomic factors are also important if there’s -- some people think there will be a recession, some people don’t. So it really depends on where the economy goes for the second half. But all we can say is we’re current. We don’t think we’re missing signals in the market, and we don’t think there’s impending changes. It will just depend on which way the underlying demand goes.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And then on the China side, it is down 14% sequentially, and it looks like probably the third quarter was still going down. Is it fair to assume that it’s fairly close to a trough there on the China spend side, given some of the ICAPS commentary that you had out of China?
Brice Hill: We won’t call it exact trough, but I think it’s a fair thought because we expect over time display will grow. We expect our services business will grow. And certainly, China is mostly an ICAPS businesses at this point, and we’re expecting strong growth there. So, I won’t call a trough, but if you ask, are the effects of the trade rules, have we absorbed those effects, I think the answer is yes.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks Vijay for your question. And now, Brice, would you like to give us your closing thoughts today?
Brice Hill: Thanks, Mike. Absolutely. So today, we emphasized that our backlog of enabling products, our ICAPS growth and our strength in services are helping us to be resilient in this market. We’re confident in the long-term growth of the semiconductor industry and committed to building the technology and capacity to support our customers. Thank you all for attending this call. We look forward to seeing many of you at our offices this quarter, and I look forward to attending the Morgan Stanley conference in a few weeks. Mike, thank you, and please close today’s call.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thanks, Brice. And I’d like to add my own closing message, which is please do join us on February 28th for our Patterning Product Launch webcast. You can find a registration link on the Events page of our IR website, where we’ll also post a replay of today’s call by 5 o’clock Pacific Time today. So, thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-11-17 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I’d now turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. Applied plans to hold an eBeam technology and new product webcast on Wednesday, December 14 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Please stay tuned for an invitation to join our presenter, Keith Wells, who is Group Vice President and General Manager of our Imaging and Process Control Group. And with that introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson : Thank you, Mike. Applied Materials delivered a strong finish to our fiscal year with record quarterly performance. Throughout 2022, the company has demonstrated solid execution while navigating COVID-related restrictions, supply chain shortages, and a challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. I would like to recognize the hard work and commitment of our global team and our suppliers who are doing everything possible to meet our customers' needs. As this is our year-end call, I'll begin my prepared remarks with a quick review of our performance and progress over the past 12 months. I'll then give our latest outlook for 2023 before describing our longer-term growth thesis for the industry and Applied. After that, Brice will provide more color on our financial performance and key areas of operational focus. Like many others in the technology sector, our performance and priorities in 2022 have been shaped by an unprecedented set of challenges. Our top priority has been mitigating supply chain constraints that prevented us from fully meeting customer demand. In Q4, we made incremental progress, and we expect to continue closing supply gaps over the next few quarters. As well as finding creative short-term solutions, our team has been addressing root causes and building a more resilient, scalable supply chain and stronger strategic relationships with our suppliers. In addition, we are strengthening our own manufacturing, logistics and supply chain management. While I'm pleased with the recent improvements in supply chain performance, we are still supply chain limited across a number of key product lines and our backlog grew in Q4. The biggest supply constraints are in our metal deposition business, where customer demand is very strong. This is our largest business unit and where we have highly differentiated solutions for advanced foundry/logic and DRAM. The market for these products, which enable next-generation wiring, is expanding considerably. In addition to supply shortages, we're also navigating a difficult geopolitical environment as reflected in the new export control regulations enacted by the U.S. government on October 7. These new rules are complex and cover a broad range of semiconductor technology that includes wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services. We have taken all the necessary actions to comply with these new rules, including suspending shipments and support where required. We estimate that the unmitigated impact to our fiscal 2023 revenues could be up to $2.5 billion. We believe the actual impact can be reduced to $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This will depend in part on how quickly the government provides licenses and approvals as well as how impacted companies refocus their investments. We are also mindful of the macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation and softening consumer demand. To offset the inflationary cost increases we are facing, we are driving multiple initiatives that include reengineering our products and implementing price adjustments. While it's too early to forecast 2023 with any precision, I can describe what we're currently seeing in the market and hearing from our customers. Starting with memory, spending is expected to be down year-on-year as weakness in consumer electronics and PCs prompts some customers to defer capacity additions. In leading-edge foundry/logic, demand looks strong, with customers racing for leadership and driving major technology inflections that determine their relative competitive positions. In ICAPS, chips for the IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor markets, demand is mixed. Consumer-driven markets are clearly softer, while the automotive, industrial and power markets remain robust. Those investments are underpinned by large inflections, including the transition to electric vehicles, accelerated adoption of industrial automation and growing demand for renewable energy solutions, especially in Europe. While all of this adds up to an expected pullback in overall wafer fab equipment spending next year, we believe that Applied's business will be more resilient than the underlying market for three key reasons. First, we have a significant backlog, the highest in our history, measured on both an absolute and percentage of revenue basis; second, demand for some of our most differentiated product lines where we have uniquely enabling technology remains much higher than our capacity to fulfill that demand; and third, our service business is positioned for steady growth with an increasingly large portion of this business being converted to subscriptions. Over the past 12 months, our installed base of systems grew 8% and the number of tools under comprehensive long-term service contracts grew 16%. The renewal rate for these agreements is well over 90%, which demonstrates the value customers see in our subscription services. Looking further ahead, our long-term growth thesis for the industry and Applied Materials has not changed. Semiconductors are the foundation of digital transformation that will touch almost every sector of the economy over the coming years. This puts the semiconductor industry on a path to a $1 trillion market by the end of the decade. And while every year will not be an up year, the overall trajectory is clear. We also like where Applied Materials plays within the ecosystem. As technology complexity is increasing, we expect equipment intensity to remain at today's levels or rise further. This means wafer fab equipment is likely to grow faster than the overall semiconductor market. Within equipment spending, major technology inflections are enabled by materials engineering, shifting more dollars to Applied's available markets over time. We think about the industry's future road map in terms of power, performance, area cost and time to market. The PPACt playbook has five pillars: new architectures, new 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink and advanced packaging, with each pillar made up of multiple technology inflections. For example, new 3D structures like gate-all-around transistors and backside power distribution networks are materials engineering enabled inflections that grow Applied's total available market. As I referenced earlier, wiring is a key bottleneck for chip performance and power at advanced nodes. And this is driving significant innovation in new materials. Between the 7- and 3-nanometer node, contact metallization steps are growing more than 50% and our total available market is expanding almost 80%. For interconnect layers, process steps are being added even faster, and we expect our revenue opportunity to approximately triple through these node transitions. Advanced packaging represents a new era for integrated circuit design that opens major new vectors of innovation for chip designers. Advanced packaging is also enabled by new materials engineering solutions. Although the industry is still in the early stages of adoption, we have already grown our packaging equipment business to nearly $1 billion. Our process diagnostics and controls business also has broad exposure to these inflections and delivered significant growth in 2022. Our progress and opportunities in e-beam will be the focus of our December technology briefing. Given our positive long-term view of the semiconductor market, the outsized opportunities for Applied Materials within the market and favorable global government incentives, we are making investments in R&D and infrastructure to support industry growth and position the company for future success. We will provide more details about our specific plans in the coming months. At the same time, with the current macroeconomic conditions, we are carefully managing discretionary spending and limiting hiring to only strategic positions. Before I hand the call over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. Applied Materials ended the year strong with record performance. In the past quarter, we made incremental progress overcoming the supply challenges that have constrained our performance in fiscal 2022. However, there is still work to do and our backlog continues to grow. We expect 2023 to be a down-year for wafer fab equipment spending, but we believe that Applied’s business will be more resilient thanks to our large backlog, growing service business and strong customer demand for our leadership products that enable key technology inflections. Longer-term, secular trends create opportunities for Applied to outgrow the semiconductor market by enabling the PPACt roadmap with our differentiated portfolio of materials engineering solutions. We are making strategic investments for the future, while slowing spending growth in the near-term. Now, I’ll hand over to Brice.
Brice Hill : Thank you, Gary. I'd like to start by thanking our team and our supply chain partners for helping to further increase our output for our customers. On today's call, I'll summarize our results for the fiscal year and Q4 as well as provide our guidance for Q1. I'll also discuss the impact of recent U.S. export regulations on our revenue and gross margin. Before going into the results, I'd like to make three points. First, despite a weaker customer demand outlook, we generated strong orders in Q4 and ended the year with record backlog, particularly in some of our leadership product areas. Combined with the resiliency of our AGS business, the strong backlog puts us in a good position to offset some of the market weakness expected next year. Second, we have not changed our view of a $1 trillion semiconductor market by 2030 and with a high single-digit CAGR for semiconductors and similar or faster growth for equipment due to added process complexity. We grew our headcount in R&D spending significantly in 2022 to develop new leadership products and further expand our broad portfolio. While we are slowing our spending growth in the current environment, we remain committed to research and development, enabling critical inflections that support our customers' roadmaps. And third, we returned nearly $7 billion to shareholders this past year, including buybacks equivalent to 6% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the period. With record demand and financial results in 2022, a strong growth opportunity through 2030 and our broad and unique portfolio of systems and services, we're confident in our financial position and our future. Next, I'll summarize our fiscal year results. Although supply chain constraints impacted our output all year, we delivered record annual revenue and EPS. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased nearly 12% to $25.8 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased by around 90 basis points to 46.6%. Non-GAAP operating profit grew by over 7% to $7.86 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin decreased by 120 basis points to 30.5%. And non-GAAP EPS increased nearly 13% to $7.70. We generated about $5.4 billion in operating cash flow this past year and over $4.6 billion in free cash flow. We returned 151% of free cash flow to shareholders, including $873 million in dividends and $6.1 billion in share repurchases. Our cash returns for the past three years were equivalent to over 100% of free cash flow. In the year, demand for our products and services was very strong with record annual bookings in semi systems and AGS. On a year-over-year basis, our total ending backlog increased 62% to $19 billion. Our semi systems backlog increased 90% to nearly $12.7 billion. We expect to reduce our semi systems backlog as supply chain performance improves. Our AGS backlog increased 30% to over $5.6 billion. The strong AGS backlog reflects a large increase in long-term service agreements, which gives us confidence in the continued growth of this business. Moving to our Q4 results. We delivered record quarterly net sales of nearly $6.75 billion and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.03. Non-GAAP gross margin declined 20 basis points sequentially to 46%. And non-GAAP OpEx grew 3.5% sequentially to nearly $1.1 billion, with most of the increase in R&D. Turning to the segments. Semi Systems revenue grew more than 6% sequentially to $5.04 billion. Segment non-GAAP operating margin increased 80 basis points sequentially to 36.9%. AGS revenue was flat quarter-over-quarter at $1.42 billion. Segment non-GAAP operating margin declined to 28.3%. AGS key performance indicators continue to be positive with strong year-over-year growth in installed base systems, service intensity and subscription agreements. As a result, AGS continues to grow faster than the pace needed to achieve our long-term revenue targets. Moving on to Display. Revenue declined as expected to $251 million. Segment non-GAAP operating margin also declined to 13.5%. Turning to our cash flows. We generated $857 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which was 13% of revenue. We returned over $1.72 billion to shareholders, including $223 million in dividends and $1.5 billion in buybacks. We repurchased 17 million shares at an average price of $88.05. Next, I'll discuss the impact of the new U.S. export regulations to Applied Materials. We currently expect that the unmitigated revenue impact of the new rules could be up to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2023. We continue to work through the regulatory requirements, including seeking licenses and approvals where appropriate. We hope to reduce the revenue impact by between $500 million and $1 billion to a net impact of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We also expect the rules to reduce our non-GAAP gross margin by up to 1 percentage point. While this creates a headwind to meeting our gross margin targets for 2024, we remain committed to our goals and believe we can even exceed them over time. In Q4, the new rules reduced our Semi Systems and AGS revenue by approximately $280 million, which was in the range of our expectation on October 12. Inventory charges in Q4 were lower than our preliminary assessment. In Q1, we expect the new rules to reduce Semi Systems and AGS revenue by approximately $490 million combined and reduce our gross margin by around 1 percentage point, both on an unmitigated basis. Now I'll share our guidance for Q1. We expect revenue to be $6.7 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.93, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue to be about $5.15 billion, which is up nearly 13% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.33 billion, which is slightly up year-over-year. Display revenue should be around $170 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46.1% and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be $1.16 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 13%, which is up from 11.8% last year, primarily due to mandatory capitalization of R&D expenses effective in our new fiscal year. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to summarize our company's position in the current environment. We have record backlog, notably in the highly enabling technologies for next-generation nodes. Our supply chain and manufacturing output are incrementally improving. We expect our services business will continue to grow and generate strong recurring revenue and free cash flow. And the longer-term growth outlook for the semiconductor industry remains strong. Applied is in a great position to invest in future growth and deliver strong profitability, free cash flow and shareholder returns. Now Mike, please begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just 1 question on today's call. If you have another question, please requeue and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse: Yes. I was hoping to clarify one thing first on China. And really, the question is, what changed between October 12 with your press release and then October 30, where it looks like there really wasn't much of an impact at all? And then my -- I guess, real question is, as you think about calendar '23 WFE, it sounds like companies are providing kind of a top-down view that things for WFE are -- look weak and declining. However, every company bottoms up based on deferred revenues and backlogs are much more optimistic on the outlook. So can you kind of talk through the moving parts there? And what kind of range or outcome you see today for year-over-year silicon declines in calendar '23?
Brice Hill: Sure. Hi, C.J., it's Brice. I'll start on this one. So relative to the preannouncement that we did, we talked about a $400 million impact, plus or minus $150 million for the China trade change. And then as we work through it, that impact ended up being less around $280 million. And it's just estimating the transactional elements at the end of the quarter. It was an initial element estimate, so we did a little bit better from that perspective. The other thing that really happened was execution in the end of the quarter was almost flawless from a logistics perspective. We got more supply chain parts in at the end of the quarter. And so, over $200 million of good news from an execution and delivery perspective, finishing product and completions in the field. So it was really those two things. It was little bit better than our initial estimate and execution was excellent in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And then on '23 -- the WFE question for '23, we think that it's preliminary. It's too early to give an estimate of '23. So what we're trying to share is what we're seeing in our order patterns and in our business for Q1 and Q2. We talked about in the script, how in Q1 -- or in our bookings for Q4, they were really solid. We did see pushouts. We did see weakness in the memory business, but our backlog has grown to a record level of backlog. So when we think about our Q1 and Q2, we're still supply constrained. We still have a number of different equipment lines that we have significant backlog. We're trying to catch up to customer orders. And so the signals to us really are that we have to work on supply chain, work on improving our output and work on catching up with our customers. So beyond that, we're just not able to make a call yet on WFE for '23.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. C.J., this is Gary. As Brice said, the -- we can certainly give a perspective on our business. We're not going to guide on overall WFE for '23. But we're in a very strong position. If you look at the kind of profile of the business, it's more weighted towards foundry/logic versus memory. And we have some very strong products where we have significant backlog, and we're still working to close the supply-demand gaps in those areas. So from Applied's standpoint, as you know, it's all about the race for power and performance for all of our customers, and we're really well positioned with leading products and those big inflections. And again, our #1 focus is on closing the supply chain gaps.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.
Stacy Rasgon: I wanted to ask you about the mitigated versus unmitigated impact from China. So you gave the numbers, $2.5 billion, and hoping to bring that down to like $1.5 billion. But I gathered a big element of that was getting licenses. Where do you expect those licenses to be gotten? Is that only to the multinational? Do you guys expect licenses to be given to some of the Chinese folks? I mean, how -- how could that happen? What is the mechanism by which you come in at the unmitigated number versus the -- coming to the mitigated number versus the unmitigated number?
Brice Hill : Stacy, it's Brice. Yes, and it's important probably to say that this unmitigated versus mitigated, it has everything to do with the impact to the China shipments and Chinese customers. In other words, it's not referring to whether we can ship a product we are making for those customers to non-China customers. So the unmitigated, the way we calculated this is we looked at the orders that we have for the affected customers, and that's what you see as the total, $2.5 billion. In order to mitigate that...
Stacy Rasgon : Does that include multinationals, too?
Brice Hill : Say again?
Stacy Rasgon : I'm sorry. Does that include multinationals, too? Or is that just the local Chinese guys…?
Brice Hill : It does not. It does not.
Stacy Rasgon : So just local semis, okay.
Brice Hill : Yes. And so the way we looked at that, there are some customers that we're trying to clarify that we can apply for licenses for or we can get authorizations for once they establish that their technology is within the guidelines. So we have a process to do that. And on the other side, we expect some customers may decide to change their plan or change their technology, so it does not go above the threshold that's affected by the rules at this point. So it's really those two elements that we'll be able to clarify that some customers were able to ship with or ship to or some customers changing their plans on the technology side that would allow them to qualify for shipments.
Stacy Rasgon : What would that mean though? Would that suck up like supply that would have ordinarily gotten built by somebody else though? Because otherwise, you're just adding like lagging-edge supply into a vacuum, essentially. How do we think about like the second order effects here?
Brice Hill : Yes. We don't think so. We expect all that equipment to be utilized. And so if that equipment has moved to a different use, then we expect it will be backfilled somewhere else for its original demand purpose, if that makes sense.
Stacy Rasgon : Got it. And I guess just one last one. Right now, I guess, you're running at the unmitigated level. When do you think it’d be at the mitigated level? Like, how likely do you think it will be that you end up at the mitigated level at some point?
Brice Hill : It's hard to say. It's a process. You can imagine there's a large number of people working on this. In fact, the whole industry is working on this. So it's job two at this point behind increasing output. So I would say it's still a good estimate today, and we're -- we'll be working throughout the year on improving the number of customers and plants that we can ship to.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya : I just wanted to clarify. I thought, Brice, you said somewhere that you provided some look for Q2. I don't think I caught that. And then several of your memory customers that said that their spending could be down over 50% next year. Recently, Micron said it could be down even more than that. Have you noticed almost 50% cancellation of orders from them? Because I'm just trying to reconcile your commentary that sounds outside of China, of course, more benign and more supportive versus just the very horrific guidance that your memory customers are providing. I understand you're less exposed to memory versus foundry/logic, but still, it's a reasonable size exposure. I'm curious, has that 50% cut in CapEx translated to any reduction in your backlog or any change in your thinking about memory for next year?
Brice Hill : Okay. Thanks, Vivek. So we're not giving a guide for Q2. We are highlighting the record backlog and the fact that we're constrained and the fact that in several equipment lines, we're behind on customer orders. So we're going to try to increase output. And I'd say that comment is true for both Q1 and Q2. So that's as much shaping as we're providing for Q2. On the memory side, just to kind of click back and think about the overall demand environment, we positioned last quarter that we had a significant amount more demand than we have the ability to supply for '23. What did happen during the course of this quarter is there is a significant amount of pushouts and reductions in that demand. Now you can see the end result. We still had solid bookings in Q4. We still -- we created a record backlog that's now disclosed. So I would say that some of those pushouts and some of those reductions were definitely in the memory space. And I wouldn't -- I'm not going to characterize what percentage it was, but I would say that that's the most affected area in the business in terms of pushouts and reductions for '23.
Vivek Arya : So you are seeing a 50% type reduction? I'm just trying to align what we are hearing from those customers versus what you are seeing on the ground in your business.
Brice Hill : Yes. Sorry, I can't quantify exactly what it is. I'll just say that, that is what -- it's biased, the reductions were biased in that area.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen.
Krish Sankar : Brice or Gary, I just wanted to find out, you mentioned how lagging edge is still pretty strong, especially auto analog in China. And I wonder like do you ever think that auto analog could be the next to drop? But in other words, if memory is going to be down next year, but lagging edge holds up, what is the risk that lagging edge rolls over in 2024 and you have two years of lackluster WFE?
Brice Hill : Okay. I'll start, maybe Gary wants to say something. We don't have a specific guide for what we call ICAPS, our mature node businesses. What we would say is there was significant growth in 2022. And when we think about all the end markets, we think the end markets are mixed. We know some of the consumer markets and even industrial have seen some weakening. But on the positive side, automotive and the power market that feeds EV and solar and other areas has been really strong. So for us, this is a critical market. We're continuing to invest and continuing to focus in this area, and we would just highlight to investors that the growth has been very strong.
Gary Dickerson : Yes. Krish, the other thing I would add is that we're -- we've made a change in our organization more than three years ago, forming our ICAPS group. And we have just very, very deep engagements with our customers, both on a technical and a support side of our business. And we have the broadest set of innovative products for ICAPS. If I look at where we're at today, those are some of the areas that -- where we have a significant backlog. MDP and implant in FY '23 are very, very strong for us. Those are areas where we have significant demand from customers. And ICAPS is similar in that to the -- all of the -- the rest of our business. This is always a race for all of these customers relative to power, performance and cost. And ICAPS is really materials enabled. We have a really strong team there. We have a great pipeline of products I will guarantee you every year we’ll not be up. That's for sure. We're not going to guide '24, but we are in a very good position in ICAPS relative to enabling technology for future inflections.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
Mark Lipacis : Gary, maybe for you. It seems like the consensus for WFE this year is somewhere in the $65 billion to $75 billion range. And I'm not asking you to give a guidance or an outlook for next year. But I'm wondering in the scenario where that is proven to be too cautious of an outlook for next year. Based on the conversations that you have with your customers, would you say that, that would be because lead times are long and customers just -- they don't want to cancel orders or there's new secular drivers, like bigger chips or advanced packaging or trailing node, like some of the things you've talked about or just competition at the leading edge is driving people to invest more, enabled by subsidies? What are your customers suggesting to you or what -- I mean, your backlog grew even as memory came down, like what do you think are the biggest drivers into next year, regardless of whatever the end number is? And what could surprise on the upside?
Gary Dickerson : Yes, Mark, thanks for the question. So all of our customers in any of these different markets, the technology is moving very, very quickly. So they're all racing against each other for power, performance cost, their relative competitive position. So certainly, as you mentioned in the leading edge foundry/logic, there's a tremendous amount of focus there, high-performance computing and a number of those different markets. And again, for Applied, what we've talked about is real strength in enabling new structures that are critical to competitive positions for our customers. Gate-all-around is an incremental $1 billion for Applied for 100,000 wafer starts more than what we're currently capturing with FinFET. We're on path to gain 5 points of share in the transition from FinFET to gate-all-around. Wiring is probably the #1 focus, and I don't know that everyone really understands how important that inflection is for our customers. That's an area where we have tremendous strength. We're enabling a 50% reduction in wiring resistance with integrated platforms that combine many technologies together. So that's another one where Applied is really well positioned. Packaging has grown for Applied to nearly $1 billion, and we have over 50% share in the broad -- in our served market. And we have, by far, the broadest position in advanced packaging, and we're still in the early innings of that inflection. But again, that's all part of this technology race for all of our customers. ICAPS, I mentioned that earlier on the call. Those are also markets where I think it's surprising to people, including you've seen some of our peers talking about ICAPS growth over a longer period of time, there are technology inflections there. And that's, as I mentioned earlier, metal deposition implant, those are areas where we're very, very -- in very strong enabling positions with our customers. I think -- the other thing for Applied, beyond all of these different areas, high-speed DRAM with logic-like structures, all of those big inflections, our PDC business grew, I think, it was 67% in FY '21. We're up around 35% in FY '22. That business is also outperforming and we think that will continue to outperform as we go forward. So at least -- from an Applied standpoint, it's really all around those big inflections and how we're positioned for those major inflections. So I don't know if -- Brice, if you want to add anything?
Brice Hill : No. I would just comment that the -- that we highlighted that we still have to catch up to customer demand in several areas. So that adds some momentum into '23. And then the other piece is just it seems clear that productivity to drive productivity in the world, a lot of these things, like in the energy market, data center market, et cetera, still have resilient demand.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.
Atif Malik : Gary, I have a question on long-term impact of China restrictions to both domestic and multinational spend. If I look at China spending over the last five years, it has outgrown WFE by 3x to 4x. What replaces this in terms of pending capital intensity and above-average profitability for you?
Brice Hill : Yes. Atif, I'll start. This is Brice. I think on the China side, when we look at that impact, the larger part of the business has been on the trailing nodes for us, and we expect that to still be a very strong business for Applied. And we see that in both the factory projects that we monitor and also in the different end markets where there's investments. And then on the leading-edge, if it's a question of do we expect that demand to be taken away from WFE demand globally and permanently? We don't. It will either be satisfied in some way in China, either by multinationals or in some other way or it will move to another geography. So we don't believe that, that will be an impact. And just circling back around, I would just focus on over time, we expect the China market to be a strong grower, especially in the ICAPS mature node space.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Toshi Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari : I wanted to ask about the AGS business going into next fiscal year and calendar year. Obviously, it's been a very steady grower for you guys and for the overall industry. Many of your leading-edge memory customers and logic and foundry customers, I believe, are in the process of cutting wafer starts, potentially over the next couple of quarters. So I guess the question is, when you cite services as one of the reasons why you'll outperform into next year, is the baseline assumption that business continues to grow given the installed base growth and given how you transform the mix of that business? Or could it be down but it’s less?
Brice Hill : Thanks, Toshi. Thank you. Yes, a couple of drivers here. You'll see in our outlook for Q1 that we have a down quarter for AGS, which is unusual. And the reason is we've got a full quarter impact, approximately $100 million for the reduction of the China customers that we won't be able to serve for the rest of the year. So that's definitely a headwind in Q1. But you hit the nail on the head with respect to the dynamics thereafter. Every time we ship a tool, it grows our installed base of equipment. We grew the installed base 8% last year. Beyond -- or after that, our ability to provide services and put those services on subscription agreements, we typically outgrow the installed base and we did last year. So that is the driver for the reason the services business is sticky. We have more equipment to serve. The equipment becomes more intensive in terms of service needs. And over time, that grows the business. Now to your point, a portion of the business is transactional. We do see lower utilization this quarter and next quarter. What we would point to -- what we have pointed to is, even in '19, where there was lower utilization, we still grew the services business. And besides the headwind of China that I pointed out, we expect that to be the dynamic this year and going forward.
Gary Dickerson: Toshiya, this is Gary. I'll add a little bit more color. So we do expect services to be up in '23. The -- as Brice mentioned, transactional will be down based on capacity utilization. But our profile, with a significant amount of our service and spares business being agreements, gives us stickiness going forward. And that is continuing to increase, the comprehensive agreements up 16% last year. The tenure of our agreements, the length of the agreements are up to 2.6 years. Renewal rates at 93%. So we're -- and it was an interesting thing through the -- all of the chip shortage period of time. We were able to demonstrate value for customers with ramp services to accelerate chip output, managed part services so that people could -- increase tool availability and output, managed services for yield and optimizing productivity. So all of that helped us position our service business in a higher value for our customers. And again, that's what gives us the ability to continue to grow into '23. And then the longer-term model we've communicated is double-digit growth and we still have high confidence we'll achieve that.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur : Another follow-up on AGS. So looking back on fiscal '22, your Semi Systems operating margin declined about 200 basis points on strong revenue growth, obviously due to the inflationary cost pressures. But your AGS business sustained near record operating margins at 30%. So I guess how has the team been able to sustain the record or near-record AGS operating profitability in this inflationary environment? And more importantly, in a down year or potential down year next year, you guys talked last call, this call, sustainability of AGS from a revenue perspective. How should we think about the sustainability of operating margins for AGS?
Brice Hill : Yes. Harlan, it's -- thank you. So one thing I would call out is we did have lower gross margins and operating margins in Q4, and that's largely due to looking at the specific inventory we had for China customers that will have to either reposition or move somewhere else or scrap. But to your point on operating profit, one of the plans the business has there is to improve the amount of repair that we do for products that we bring back to customers. And so that helps us lower the cost and cost of goods sold with customers. And that's one of the ways that we improve our gross margins and the ultimate profit of that business. The other is just increased efficiency. As we demonstrate more and more capability with the customers, and we provide more services with the same spending profile, then that helps us maintain the profitability. Those are the two key drivers.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.
Joe Quatrochi : I wanted to ask about the gross margin impact from the China restriction. Can you talk about what's driving that 1 percentage point impact? And then how do we think about what you could potentially recapture in the mitigated scenario that you outlined?
Brice Hill : Yes. Thank you. So two things. And it depends on which time period you look at. But if we -- if we look forward, the gross margin impact is really that they're generally smaller customers. So the profitability of those customers for Applied is higher. And when we talk about mitigation, as we go forward, it's going to be TBD as to who we sell that product to and what the profitability is. So at this point, we're expecting the impact that we described. And if you look at the current quarter, we did have specific inventory for customers that's unique. We are working to qualify some of that inventory, and we were successful to a degree, but we did have specific inventory that we had to take a demand reserve on.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS Securities.
Timothy Arcuri : Gary, I had a question about WFE intensity. So we're exiting this year at 15.5%, and you were saying that through 2030, you think WFE is going to grow faster than semiconductors. You've certainly been beating that drum now for a while that WFE intensity is going to keep going up. And obviously, there are some underlying upward pressures. But China has obviously been ordering tools and building capacity well ahead of demand now, in part due to the fear of these bans. So if China becomes a little more of a lagging tier region, wouldn't that lower WFE intensity a bit and maybe argue that maybe it has to reset a bit?
Brice Hill : Tim, I'll jump in for a second here, just because I have the picture of the graph in my mind that we use. So -- we do think intensity is gradually increasing, and it's because of the reasons Gary described. A lot of steps in the process are becoming more complex and require more equipment, and we see that. And then when we think about China and ICAPS specifically, in the past, there's been a lot of reuse of existing fabs and existing process tools. And that allowed for a low intensity. And that's not been what's happening in the past few years and with recent additions. We've talked about the number of factory projects that we see. So as capacity gets added, even in the ICAPS space, what you see is an intensity level that's more like what we were experiencing on the leading-edge just a few years ago. And that's also serving to raise the overall average of intensity. So we're pretty confident that intensity will continue to rise.
Gary Dickerson : Tim, on the -- relative to ICAPS, just reminding people that there was a time period where you had a lot of movement of business to foundries. And during that time period, there were many factories and tools that came on the market, all of that stuff is gone. So that's what Brice was referring to relative to ICAPS capital intensities. And then if you look at all of the -- I went through a list of key inflections technology inflections for customers and I gave some color around wiring and the number of steps that are increasing. That's what we're seeing really in all of the different segments of the business. So I think that capital intensity is probably the right ZIP code if we look through 2030.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: Great. I wonder if you could talk about the environment in China with the multinationals. Obviously, they need to get a license, they did immediately get a license, but it's a 12-month license. So would you say that you generally see the footprint moving away from China with those multinational customers? Do you see any potential for that to become an issue down the road? Can you just talk generally to the fact that the multinationals were included in this?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, Joe, this is Gary. Thanks for the question. The multinationals are not impacted today. Relative to their strategies, we'd really rather have them comment on that. So again, just today, they're not impacted. How they position their businesses geographically, that's really up to them.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: I want to follow up on the earlier question on the longer-term WFE. As you think about the growth of WFE in the next, call it, three to five years, how do you think about the mix between the different type of tools, that how that could change? Meaning, deposition and edge versus litho versus process control, as you talk to your customers about the roadmap and technology inflections. And I also want to ask about -- I assume your served addressable market will continue to expand, but maybe help us understand how much would that grow?
Gary Dickerson : Yes. Sidney, thanks for the question. So if you look at what our customers are talking about relative to their roadmaps, really, there are five big drivers of the technologies going forward, workload-specific architectures. There are new structures, new materials, new ways to shrink, new advanced packaging inflections for our customers. And so what we see, if you look at the advanced foundry/logic road map, you see a tremendous focus on new structures and new materials. The transistor innovations around gate-all-around are essential relative to power and performance. wiring. I talked a lot about wiring. Our largest business is metal deposition and the wires are getting thinner and resistance goes up. So you're seeing more dollars moving in that direction. Advanced packaging is an area where we see -- for sure, that's another big -- one of the big five drivers for the roadmaps for our customers. And that's still in the early innings around $1 billion business for us today, over 50% served market for the areas we participate. And so we see that one. That's an area that will attract a tremendous amount of investment. And relative to competition between customers is very, very important. In memory, you certainly see material scaling in 3D NAND as customers are moving to more layers or other ways to include logic and memory together through different technology inflections. DRAM is moving to high speed. And so you have high-K metal gate and logic-like structures there. So a lot of that investment is moving more towards materials-enabled technologies, and that's where Applied has really a tremendous strength. I don't know, Brice, if you want to add anything there?
Brice Hill : No. Good. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.
Quinn Bolton: Just had a question with the Chips Act applications expected to be received or submitted beginning sort of the February timeframe. I'm wondering as you look at your '23 WFE outlook, do you expect to see any benefits from Chips Act spending in '23? Or do you think it's really more of a '24 and beyond before it hits WFE spending?
Brice Hill : We do expect, Quinn, a small, really small amount in '23. On the equipment side, it will likely really start in '24 as a number of those projects are -- start with construction. There are a few that will start with equipment, but it will really, for us be more the '24 timeframe.
Gary Dickerson : Quinn, one thing I'd add is that those investments are time bound. And so as Brice said, not so much in '23, starting in but there are -- there is timing associated with those incentives.
Michael Sullivan : Thanks, Quinn. And operator, we have time for two more questions today.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street.
Pierre Ferragu : Gary, I'd like to come back to the comments you made about capital intensity and the specifics at the trailing edge part of your portfolio. And so you described there, I think, like three reasons why capital intensity -- I mean, two reasons why capital intensity is very high there. I mean, higher than the past. The first one is that there is no innovation going on. So like that drives capital intensity up. And then you mentioned the fact that there used to be like a secondhand market that was feeling the trailing edge that is kind of going away. And my question is there must be also a third element that justifies a very high capital intensity today, which is that we've been growing capacity very, very fast this year and last year. And there is a significant chance that the capacity growth is at some point going to slow down or even to pause. And so I'd like to hear your thoughts about that and maybe a sense of how much it could impact in the shorter term capital intensity.
Gary Dickerson : Pierre, this is Gary. Thanks for the question. So I will say that we're 100% certain that all of these markets will not be up every year. But what we do see, if you think about pick a number, in terms of edge computing devices by 2030. These technologies are becoming much, much more pervasive. They're really -- if you think about industrial automation or gas to smart electric vehicles, a number of different inflections, a lot of these ICAPS technologies are going to grow at a fair compound annual growth rate. And I think that's what other people are seeing also. So how that -- what the shape of that looks like every single year, we're not going to forecast that. But we do think that, that business is going to see healthy growth. And that's why also we formed the ICAPS organization three years ago. We saw that, that market was going to be significant from a growth perspective and pulled together all of our different technologies. So again, if I look across all of those segments within ICAPS, we think over the longer term, there will be significant compound annual growth rates. We have very, very strong positions in enabling some of those technology inflections in ICAP, but we're not going to give a specific profile on a year-by-year basis.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of David O'Connor with Exxon BNP.
David O'Connor : Great. Follow-up on the backlog to a previous question. Gary or Brice, how should we think about the time frame of getting the backlog back to a kind of more normalized level or -- when do you expect to get caught up on demand for those products that are running pretty hot on the PPACt side?
Brice Hill : Yes. Thanks, David. We're expecting it's going to take us more than two quarters. So depending on the line of equipment, I would say between two and four quarters is our internal estimate. And so -- that's what we're focused on. We are behind with the customers, and we're working on increasing output every week. Thanks for the question.
Michael Sullivan : Yes. Thanks, David, for your question. And Brice, would you like to give us your closing thoughts today?
Brice Hill : Yes. Absolutely. Clearly, there are questions about the market in the near term. But for our part, we had healthy Q4 orders, and we have record backlog that we described and it's mostly in our leadership product areas that drive the big technology inflections. Job one for us is increasing our output to meet customer demand. We're in a strong financial position to continue to develop our broad portfolio of technology and to drive the critical inflections and to support, eventually, a $1 trillion semiconductor market. I hope we get to see many of you at the upcoming Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo conferences. In the meantime, we hope you enjoy a safe and happy Thanksgiving. Thank you. Mike, let's close it up.
Michael Sullivan : Okay. Great, Brice. So we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 Pacific Time. And we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-08-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session.  I will now turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining Applied’s Third Quarter of Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that today’s call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied’s most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today’s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today’s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. Applied plans to host our Services Master Class five weeks from today on Thursday, May 26th at 9 o’clock Pacific Time. We will describe the market opportunity for our Services business, explain why 87% of AGS revenue is truly recurring and give you the growth formula for the business through our 2024 financial model horizon and beyond. We hope you will join team members of our global services team for presentations and Q&A. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. In our third fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered results at the high end of our guidance range and record quarterly revenues. The actions we have been taking to mitigate supply chain challenges are beginning to have an impact and we expect steady incremental improvements from here. Resolving supply issues has required new levels of collaboration between our global teams, suppliers and customers. While all of this hard work is yielding results, global supply chains remain stretched. Demand for Applied’s products is still higher than our ability to fulfill it and our backlog continues to grow. In addition, our relentless focus on meeting customer’s needs in this very difficult environment has created margin headwinds that we are working hard to overcome. We are driving actions to reduce costs and improve value capture, including price adjustments. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three key topics; first, our near-term outlook on supply and demand dynamics; second, our longer term view of the markets and the industry’s roadmap; and third, Applied Materials strategy, priorities and progress. After that, Brice, will provide more color on our financial performance in key areas of operational focus. Let me begin with our near-term perspective on the market. Due to large gaps between demand and supply, as well as equipment companies shipping partially finished systems and merging components in the field, overall 2022 wafer fab equipment spending is difficult to quantify with precision. Our best estimate is that it will land somewhere in the mid-$90 billion range. For Applied, the picture is clearer. If we use the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, we expect our wafer fab equipment revenues to be up approximately 15% for our fiscal year. As we look ahead to 2023, there are three major factors shaping our view of the market. First, memory spending is expected to be lower than in 2022, as macro uncertainty and weakness in consumer electronics and PCs causes these customers to defer some capacity additions. Second, leading-edge foundry/logic looks strong, with customers battling for leadership and racing to be first to implement major technology inflections. Third, ICAPS customers, who serve IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor markets, are reporting areas of strength and weakness. These customers serve broad and diverse applications. They are seeing softness in consumer-centric markets, which are being impacted by macroeconomic factors. Auto and industrial demand continues to be solid, because those investments are driven by large inflections, such as electric vehicles and industrial automation. In these areas, chip makers are securing long-term capacity agreements that underpin their capital spending plans. While it’s too early to provide a forecast for 2023, we believe our business will be more resilient than in the past if there is a demand pullback in certain areas of the market. We expect Applied to remain supply constrained for the next several quarters. We are working through our very substantial backlog of orders, which provides a buffer to in-year demand fluctuations, and in addition, customers are providing us with longer term visibility and commitments in response to their own customer’s actions to lock-in the strategic capacity they need. Although, we are confident in our ability to perform well in a range of market scenarios, we are mindful of the current macroeconomic trends. As a result, we are slowing down hiring, while ensuring we fully fund the R&D programs and strategic operational capabilities that support our long-term growth. Regionalization of supply chains is also something new for the industry. We expect this will provide a small positive tailwind for overall wafer fab equipment spending starting in late 2023. Also, because of the time-bound nature of government incentives in the U.S., Europe and Asia, we see a higher degree of certainty for these investments. Last week, I was in Washington, D.C. for the signing of the CHIPS Act and met with government officials and leaders from across the semiconductor and automotive ecosystems. I am happy to see the critical role that semiconductors play in the economy being recognized and acted upon. The need to build more resilient and flexible supply chains remains a key theme for these leaders and the CHIPS Act will enable many companies to accelerate their investments in strategic capacity. I am also excited about the potential to create a new high-velocity innovation platform in the United States to accelerate the development and commercialization of next-generation technologies. As I look further to the future, I feel very positive about the direction of the industry and our long-term opportunities at Applied. Consensus within the industry is that semiconductor revenues can reach $1 trillion before the end of the decade. That translates to a high single-digit compound annual growth rate from today. In parallel, the technology roadmap is becoming increasingly complex. As a result, we expect equipment intensity, the ratio of wafer fab equipment investment to semi revenues to remain at today’s level or increase over this period. Then the major technology roadmap inflections, including gate-all-around transistors, backside power distribution networks, new materials for interconnect and contact, and heterogeneous integration of chips and chiplets, are enabled by materials engineering, where Applied Materials is the leader and this shifts more dollars to our available market over time. We have invested ahead of these inflections to create a portfolio of differentiated solutions that positions us to outperform as these new technologies transition to volume manufacturing. Applied Materials strategy is built upon the breadth and strength of our technology and capabilities. This provides us with a unique ability to engineer, co-optimize and integrate solutions that address our customer’s highest value technology challenges. Co-optimized solutions, where we optimize adjacent process steps and Integrated Material Solutions or IMS, where we optimize a combination of process steps in a single system under vacuum are becoming an increasingly important part of our product portfolio. In our recent Master Class, we talked about a breakthrough IMS approach for tungsten-only contacts that are free of conventional barrier materials. This provides significant improvements in contact resistance and is critically enabling for smaller foundry/logic nodes. The number of process steps are growing as these customers migrate to this pure metal technology and these low resistance integrated solutions for contact and wiring represent new multibillion dollar revenue opportunities. Over the past two quarters, we have secured multiple tool of record positions at all leading customers. Our ability to co-optimize materials engineering solutions with novel inspection and metrology is also driving record performance in our Process Diagnostics and Control business. We expect PDC revenues to be up almost 40% in fiscal 2022 with broad-based customer adoption of our eBeam Metrology and new optical wafer inspection platforms. In the quarter, we also strengthened our ICAPS portfolio with a tuck-in acquisition. Picosun is a leader in batch ALD technology and we are delighted to welcome their talented team to the Applied Materials family. Turning to Service, AGS delivered record quarterly revenues despite headwinds for our transactional spares and 200-millimeter equipment businesses due to supply chain constraints. The subscription portion of AGS continues to demonstrate strength. Installed base tools under long-term service agreements grew 9% over the past 12 months. Our renewal rate for these agreements continues to be strong and is currently running at 93%. Before I hand the call over to Brice, I will quickly summarize. We are beginning to see gradual improvements in our supply chain, which enabled us to deliver record revenue for the quarter. We expect demand to remain higher than supply for the next several quarters and we are continuing to drive actions to close the gap. The changing macroeconomic environment is causing some customers to adjust the timing of their investments. However, we are confident that our business will be more resilient, thanks to strong pull for a uniquely enabling technology, our large backlog, longer term visibility from our customers and industry-wide investment in strategic regional capacity. Our long-term view of the market remains unchanged as multiple parallel secular trends drive the semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets structurally higher. At the same time, large technology inflections that are enabled by our core capabilities in materials engineering create outsized growth opportunities for Applied Materials. Now, I will hand the call over to Brice.
Brice Hill: Thank you, Gary. I’d like to begin by saying thank you to our teams and our supply chain partners for helping to increase our output, despite ongoing constraints and unexpected shortages. Our factory and logistics teams operated with agility, adjusting to almost daily changes in supply schedules. We are still not meeting all of our customer’s demand and solving the supply chain shortages to increase our manufacturing output remains our top priority. Before I summarize our Q3 results, I’d like to emphasize four points. First, our overall demand remains healthy. Specifically, our orders remained strong in Q3, our backlog increased, overall factory utilization remains high and customers have added four new factory projects to the long-term road map. There are pockets of weakness in the semiconductor market and a number of affected customers have asked us to reschedule their capacity additions. At the same time, there are areas of strength and we have broad market exposure and strong customer pull for technology investments. Second, our supply chain improved incrementally in the quarter, as Gary mentioned. We have added significant investments in talent to our supply chain teams to resolve bottlenecks and to improve our inventory and overall output. Third, we remain committed to our long-term gross margin targets. Today, we are still experiencing the effects of higher costs and unfavorable mix, which are being partially offset by pricing adjustments. We expect to incrementally improve gross margins over the coming quarters, driven by forecasted improvements in manufacturing volumes, product mix, pricing and logistics costs. And fourth, we are confident in the industry’s underlying growth trajectory and our unique materials engineering capabilities for process innovation. While we are slowing our headcount growth, we have increased our R&D spending by around 10% year-to-date and remain fully invested in enabling our customer’s roadmaps. Turning to our Q3 results, we delivered record revenue of $6.52 billion, which is in the high end of our guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin of 46.2%, declined 80 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Non-GAAP operating spending was $1.06 billion, which is right on target and up $39 million quarter-on-quarter, as we increased R&D and added supply chain resources. Non-GAAP operating margin declined 60 basis points to 30%, driven by the lower gross margin and headcount additions primarily in engineering. Non-GAAP earnings of $1.94 grew $0.09 quarter-on-quarter and matched our previous record. Turning to the segments. The Semi Systems team did a great job maximizing shipments, growing revenue by $276 million, up 6% quarter-on-quarter. Segment non-GAAP operating margin declined 100 basis points sequentially to 36.1% due to higher materials, freight, expedite and labor costs, partially offset by price adjustments. The AGS team delivered record quarterly revenue, growing $37 million or 3% quarter-on-quarter. We continued to deliver healthy year-over-year growth in subscription revenue, while the supply chain shortages constrained our growth in transactional parts and 200-millimeter systems. AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 30.6% and slightly up quarter-over-quarter. I will take a minute to share a few observations about AGS. Next month, we will host a Services Master Class where you will have an opportunity to learn more about our strategy to increase our recurring revenue. The three key drivers are the growth of our installed base, equipment service intensity and long-term service agreements. AGS is making excellent progress toward our 2024 financial model. We exited Q3 tracking around $500 million ahead of the base case of our AGS revenue plan and around $250 million ahead of our high case. In addition, the Services business is capital light and produces excellent cash flow. Moving on to Display now, the market is weaker due to its high exposure to consumer portion of the economy. During the quarter, we lowered spending in line with the current market environment. Our Display revenue declined by $48 million or 13% to $333 million. The business contributed $70 million of non-GAAP operating profit, which is down sequentially by $12 million or 15%. Turning to our cash flows, we generated $1.47 billion of operating cash flow during the quarter, which was 23% of revenue. We returned $1.23 billion or 97% of free cash flow to our shareholders, deploying $1 billion to repurchase 9.8 million shares of company stock and paying $225 million in dividends. We also deployed around $440 million for two strategic acquisitions. We expanded our ALD portfolio with the addition of Picosun, and we acquired a talented simulation software team. Year-to-date, we have produced over $4.5 billion in operating cash flow and nearly $4 billion in free cash flow, and returned $5.25 billion to our shareholders. Now I will share our guidance for Q4. We expect revenue to increase to $6.65 billion plus or minus $400 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $2 plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue to increase to $4.93 billion or up 14% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to increase to $1.43 billion or up 4% year-over-year, with continued healthy growth in Services and ongoing supply chain limitations in 200-millimeter systems and transactional parts. Display revenue should decline to around $250 million. We expect to incrementally increase our non-GAAP gross margin to 46.4%. And we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly to $1.08 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 11.8%. Before we begin the Q&A, I’d like to summarize our company’s position in the current environment. We continue to see very strong customer pull for advanced technology in all of our markets and our backlog continues to grow. We believe some of our customers will moderate their capacity additions in areas that have been impacted by weak consumer spending. However, I expect Applied’s business to be more resilient than in past periods for three reasons. One is that we have strong exposure to technology investments, particularly in the foundry/logic market, which has grown to become approximately two-thirds of wafer fab equipment spending. Second is that we have multiple quarters of backlog for products that are essential to our customer’s technology road maps and we expect to continue to increase supply over the next several quarters. Third, that our Services business has grown to over $5.5 billion in size and generates 87% of revenue from recurring demand for parts, services and software. And now, Mike, please begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today’s call. If you have another question, please re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let’s please begin.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I guess a question for me would be in light of record backlog and extended lead times, and then some of the puts and takes around customers moving out production plans. How are you thinking about the timing of easing of supply constraints? How are you thinking about kind of internal tool production into 2023 and as part of that driving, I assume, gross margins higher throughout that time, would love to hear your thoughts around that?
Brice Hill: Good afternoon, C.J. It’s Brice. Just -- yeah, good question on supply constraints and timing versus the demand environment, et cetera. So let me explain what we have done the last couple of weeks. We just went through a cycle where we reconfirmed all of our 2023 demand with our customers. Something we do once or twice per quarter on a regular basis and it gives the customer base a chance to signal if they want to make changes, they want to make adds, they want to make drops, and in a constrained environment, that lets us balance our supply across the customer base in the best way. So we have just completed that. And there are a number of changes, but what we see for 2023 and the next three-plus quarters, as we said in our initial comments, is that demand is still significantly above our ability to supply, but we have got the confidence that we just reconfirmed all of that. And then when we think about supply, our comments -- we have invested significantly in the supply chain. So we are working to identify issues and loosen the supply chain and solve problems in the supply chain both at our direct suppliers and our secondary suppliers. So our expectation is that, we will increase output for the next several quarters and continue to work on that backlog, which as you highlighted, has been -- has continued to grow.
Gary Dickerson: Hey, C.J., this is Gary. I guess, also relative to supply chain, what we have been, certainly, the zero COVID lockdown in Shanghai, March 28, that set us back relative to overall supply chain. We are continuing to make incremental progress. And I just -- right now we see it still being incremental going forward. We are doing everything we can, making investments, adding manpower, but it’s more incremental, and I think the same thing is true on margins. I think last quarter we said that, we would see incremental progress from where we were and I think that’s really the direction both for supply chain and for margins is more incremental improvement throughout 2022 and going into 2023.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Lipacis of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Mark Lipacis: Question, I guess the question I have is, Gary, maybe if you could help us understand the mechanics around what you guys do when your customers come in, and say, oh, we are adjusting that, I think you used the expression adjusting the timing of the orders. So do you push there, are you able to, like, take the slot that you have allocated for them and push them back a quarter or two or do you -- at some point, do you just say, listen, we can’t push this back anymore, you either got to take it or go to the end of the line. If you could just provide some color about what you are seeing real-time on the ground, is -- like how many people are pushing back, is it a quarter, is it two quarters and the mechanics operationally about how you guys manage that process? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yeah. I know Gary is going to comment. I will just make a quick comment, Mark. When we go out and test the backlog with the customers, if they want to make changes a lot of times, that’s a mutually beneficial change. We have another customer that’s interested in taking the tool, because the demand is exceeding supply at this point. So the first thing we do is try to accommodate those changes. We are not trying to demand the customers stay on the schedule that they have, et cetera. So we try to be flexible. And that was really the point of going out and retesting and re-verifying all of the demand that we have across the customer base. So, Gary, you may want to add to that.
Gary Dickerson: No. I think that’s exactly right. Again, the challenge we face right now, again, many of our customers are really driving major technology inflections. And Mark, I think, you see also, especially in high performance logic, everyone is racing to these new inflections. So we just have tremendous demand from those customers in ICAPS, automotive, industrial automation. So, unfortunately, we are not able to supply to that demand. And as Brice said, memory is weaker, and we try to manage and work with the customers to come up with the right outcome for them and for us.
Mark Lipacis: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: I am trying to reconcile the two things, right? One, I think, Brice, you mentioned you are going to be increasing capacity over the next several quarters. But then from a demand perspective, I believe, Gary, you said that, memory could be down, I think, you have said kind of mixed views on ICAPS, but then leading-edge should be up. So my specific question is, based on -- I know you are not giving next year’s guidance per se, but based on what you see, are we looking at kind of a garden variety, flat to down 5%, 10% in terms of the spending environment or is it very different than that view? Just so that we have some baseline view of how you are thinking about the industry going into the next year given you do plan to increase supply?
Brice Hill: Hi, Vivek. It’s Brice. So to reconcile those two, I think the first thing to be clear on from our side is that, demand for the next several quarters, three-plus is far higher than supply. So we are going to concentrate, like, we say, on increasing our supply and we will do our best to do that over the next several quarters and that’s our expectation is demand will stay above where we can supply across that time period. So I think someone said it before that we are under serving the market so far that such that if there’s a change in demand, it’s still above where our supply line is. That’s the perspective we have. And if you think about or if you are asking about 2023, like we said, it’s too early to make a call on 2023. But what we would point out is different areas of the market, sure, are having some weakness, some inventory issues. Other areas are very strong and are on schedule to build the processes that they need for customer products that are also on schedule. So we think those puts and takes more or less will continue the demand signal for us into next year.
Vivek Arya: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon: Question, I was wondering if you could comment separately on your memory and your foundry/logic backlog. So I assume the memory backlog is coming down given it’s weaker, but it sounds like your overall backlog is still increasing if your demand is still well exceeding supply. So is it a case of like your foundry backlog is increasing more than your memory backlog is shrinking or like how do I think about the different pieces of that?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Exactly right, Stacy. This is Brice. Definitely, the backlog is increasing, and definitely, the foundry/logic backlog is the strongest -- yeah, strongest component of that in terms of orders and adds to our order book. I’d say that’s good. We know there has been reductions on the memory side. I don’t actually know if the memory side is down in total overall. But I think that’s a fair way to look at it. Some customers have reduced backlog on memory, but overall foundry/logic and some of the ICAPS customers are driving an outweighing increase on the positive side.
Gary Dickerson: Hey, Stacy. This is Gary. So also the foundry/logic is an increasing percentage of overall wafer fab equipment. So if you look at the percentages, foundry/logic is really around two-thirds of total wafer fab equipment. And so, certainly, the rates for competitiveness in high performance, you see that with companies making significant investments. ICAPS, you have seen a lot of announcements with companies making long-term investments in the ICAPS capacity. So, certainly, you see that in the increasing percentage of foundry/logic in the overall market. So, yeah, I think that, what Brice said and what you had also asking your question, certainly, foundry/logic is strong and that backlog still, unfortunately, we are not able to meet demand.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That’s helpful guys. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open.
Atif Malik: First question for Brice. Brice, some of your U.S. peers had talked about expanding China restrictions to sub-14-nanometer. Did that impact your July or October quarter outlook and if you can remind us of your total China sales, what is Display Systems versus silicon?
Brice Hill: Thanks, Atif. Yeah. First of all, we did get the same notice as our peers did on that. So that is sub-14-nanometer shipments to China customers, and it did not impact our July quarter and very small for October quarter, and that’s included in our guidance. So that part is clear. And we will work to make sure that we are in full compliance with all the changes on trade rules as we always have. So, but nothing significant in July or October periods. And then could you repeat the Display question…
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. I will take it.
Brice Hill: Yeah.
Gary Dickerson: Atif, thank for the question. So we are not going to break out the exact amount of our business in China. But Display, most of our Display revenue does come from China and then you have the global customers and the domestic customers. So that’s the -- and you have Systems and Service for all of those different businesses. So not going to break out all of those different percentages, but what I would say is that, and I think we have talked about this before, that by far, the majority of our semi foundry/logic business in China is ICAPS, which is on the trailing nodes.
Atif Malik: Thank you. That helps.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Brice, if overall WFE is down, say, 10% next year, how should we think about AMAT’s total revenues, including Semi and Services, given the strong backlog? And more importantly, how to think about the EPS, if you say WFE was down 10%? Brice, any color you could give there and how to think about revenue and operating leverage in that environment would be very helpful?
Brice Hill: Sure. Thanks, Krish. So the first thing, just to remind investors, you kind of made the point in the question about our backlog. We do have, as you said, a large backlog and we expect for the next three plus quarters, we will just be working on raising our output and serving that backlog. But if you want to do a what if, if revenue goes down or if WFE goes down, the first thing I would remind investors also is that our Services business doesn’t fluctuate or correlate 100% with WFE. It’s driven off our installed base, which grows every time we ship a tool and the utilization across the entire factory network that we are serving transactional, spares and subscription service agreements across that. So that portion of our revenue tends to dampen any weakness that we would have from a lower WFE, I would just highlight that for people that are thinking model. So whatever would change on WFE and change on the equipment side, it would be a dampened signal on the Services piece of the business. And then for overall modeling purposes, I would look at probably as a proxy year 2019 to see how the business reacted to a lower revenue environment, where you can look at the margin performance in 2019, which was down 1 point or 2 points and you can look at spending where it was controlled, relatively flat. I think those would be the same sort of reaction the company would be able to implement in that sort of environment if you were doing a what if, which again is in our forecast.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks a lot, Brice. Really appreciate it.
Brice Hill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks so much. Gary, I was hoping you could expand on some of the comments you made regarding the CHIPS Act and the implications for the broader industry, but more importantly, your business. I think you stated in your prepared remarks that you expect it to be a small tailwind or a minor tailwind starting in late 2023. First of all, if you could sort of quantify that for us for 2023 and 2024, that would be super helpful. And then, more importantly, how has the conversations you are having with your customers changed since the CHIPS Act has gone through? I guess the main question that I get from investors is, if a big foundry in Taiwan decides to build capacity in the U.S., isn’t it sort of a zero sum game where you sort of subtract from what could have happened in Taiwan and you just kind of take that over to the U.S.? So net-net, isn’t it sort of a zero sum, but how would you kind of respond to that? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Thank you, Toshiya. So on the CHIPS Act, first, I’d say, just I am very happy to see the CHIPS and Science Act pass and become law. That’s really positive to the United States and the overall industry. And then relative to the investment question that you asked, I would look at it as a small positive tailwind for overall wafer fab equipment spending and really timing-wise starting in late 2023. If you look at the investments, at least the ones that have been announced so far, it’s really in high performance logic, some ICAPS investments, those kinds of things. So as I mentioned earlier, again, two-thirds of wafer fab equipment is in that foundry/logic space today and so that’s going to be incrementally positive going into late 2023 and beyond. Those investments also are time bound. If you look at the incentives, there are certain time frames where the funding is available and investments have to be made. So that creates a higher degree of certainty. I would say, as those companies, I have talked to many of them and as they move to new locations, there is start-up costs and some incremental less efficiency, as they start those fabs and especially for our Service business, that’s an incremental positive. So I think you would see small incremental spending late 2023 and beyond, as all of those investments in those factories are starting up. Over time, Toshiya, I think, really as they -- it really depends on the scale of those factories, a bigger factory is more efficient than a smaller factory and so until they build them out, which will take many, many years, there will be a degree of less efficiency for some period of time. But, again, if you look at it in the grand scale of overall WFE, it’s not a huge tailwind, but it’s definitely a tailwind.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to expand on some comments that Brice had on services. Maybe this is a plug for your upcoming Master Class. But I mean in the event of a weaker WFE environment next year, you have several positive buffers. I think the biggest one, your Services business historically does not decline during downturns, in fact, over the past 11 years, and I think, that’s four WFE down cycles, I believe that there’s only been one year that AGS was down and it’s driven a pretty stable like 8% to 10% sort of revenue CAGR over that period of time. So outside of the annuity like subscription contracts that I assume will be partially offset by, let’s say, 200-millimeter equipment sales, which may fall off in a weak WFE environment. What is the team doing to ensure continued outperformance of Services doing WFE weakness and your confidence on driving growth in Services if WFE is down next year?
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. If I got it there, what we are focused on, the two drivers for that business as you kind of hinted to are really the installed base that grows every time we ship a tool. And then, as you highlighted, our ability to serve that installed base both through transactional support spares and services and then the subscription agreements that we have with customers that offer spares plus insights that we have across the network on how to optimize for yield and how to optimize for capabilities. So I think what we are doing is increasing our portfolio of service offerings that make it more valuable to the customer. It allows them to ramp more quickly, reach higher yields and really benefit from the intelligence that Applied has across the whole ecosystem of tools that they don’t have potentially on their own. I think that’s the focus area for the company and that’s what gives us confidence that as that installed base grows, we will be able to continue to grow our subscription agreements. And just the last piece is, you are right, we have the same analysis on not being 100% correlated with WFE and…
Harlan Sur: Right.
Brice Hill: … even as -- if there’s changes in WFE or weakness in the revenue and the rest of the business, it’s really about the underlying utilization in the factories that exist and the need for services and intelligence in those factories. So I think those are the key drivers.
Gary Dickerson: Harlan, just -- yeah. Thanks for reminding people about the Master Class coming up here next month. The one thing that I think has helped us also, so if you -- you talked about 10 years, 11 years. If you go back over that time period, we -- I think close to doubled our percentage of subscription agreements versus transactional. So certainly -- and we have increased the length of those agreements to two and a half years. So that percentage of agreements being so much higher and it’s still growing, that makes that business more resilient. And I think that…
Harlan Sur: Yeah.
Gary Dickerson: … also relative to the environment we have been in, where everybody is focused with chip shortages, producing good chips out, it really has also highlighted more value in our services. Things like managed part services, where people have the parts available versus competing for what’s available from a transactional perspective, along with all the things that Brice talked about. I think that’s really helped highlight the value of these longer term subscription agreements for our customers.
Michael Sullivan: And Harlan, this is Mike…
Harlan Sur: Yeah. Thanks for the insight. Yeah.
Michael Sullivan: Yeah. Hey, Harlan. It’s Mike. I think that earlier I gave the right timing for the next Master Class. It’s in five weeks from today, but I think I heard myself say May 26, which is the last date. It’s September 22nd, of course. So thank you.
Harlan Sur: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Joe Quatrochi: You talked about still seeing strength in -- especially in leading-edge, foundry/logic investments, but there’s also some consumer driven demand there as well. So, I guess, have you maybe seen a change in terms of like the capacity that your customers are looking to put in place there, but still not change their technology roadmaps?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Joe. Yeah. The way I would think about it, first of all, I think, yes, we have highlighted that demand is higher than our supply level, there’s been changes. I think in total, that demand came down a little bit, but it’s still above what we are able to supply for the out quarters. But I think the way we think about it for a leading-edge foundry is, they are building processes that their customers are building products on and they need to be able to hit those schedules for the customer products. So they are fairly committed to getting that technology in place. And then you are right, the volumes will fluctuate depending on what the market is for those products. But if you are building a logic node for a product two years from now, you are really thinking about what the market is two years from now when you are putting that equipment in place. So it’s not as simple as just looking at the current quarter’s macroeconomic environment, GDP and lowering your demand. You really have to think about that forward looking function. But the dynamics -- you have the dynamics right. We just retested all of the demand for next year and that’s what all the customers are thinking about.
Joe Quatrochi: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Around some of the mixed signals around what’s happening this time around, and on one hand, customers are pushing out, but you also mentioned that you are getting long-term commitments from some other customers. I was wondering what that means, because it kind of sounds like you are confident that foundry/logic is going to hold up at this time even as memory pushes out and that’s not usually how it works. Is it something that there’s such a concentration of leading-edge foundry capacity and there’s going to be others such as your neighbor that are trying to compete to get back in the foundry business? Is that what’s different this time, because I am hearing these mixed signals and there’s something obviously different. So I am just wondering if you can call on your past knowledge to help on that?
Brice Hill: Sure, Tim. Just two comments, the first is we have definitely expanded the horizon with all of our customers from a planning perspective. They are giving us longer signals than before and giving us the opportunity to engage in the discussion on capacity planning with them. And second, some customers are also giving us a sense that or a promise basically that they will operate within a certain band of capacity. So they are giving us additional confidence to what we should plan for from a high confidence perspective and that’s a little bit different than what we have done before.
Gary Dickerson: Hey, Tim. This is Gary. I would say one other thing that is helping us in this timeframe. If you look at the relative investment for the upcoming inflections, more of the dollars are going to new materials and new structures. Gate-all-around, we talked about that in the Master Class. Wiring for interconnect from 7 to 3 goes up, I think, 3X dollars per wafer as you go, you have -- go to the 3-nanometer node, there’s more steps. We have these Integrated Material Solutions that combine seven technologies on one integrated platform to lower the wiring resistance by 50%. Backside power distribution, if you look at what one of our customers said recently, they talked about significant increase in materials and structures relative to power performance for them going to their future technology nodes. Backside power distribution is another one that’s a significant inflection. You can reduce the area up to 30% without shrinking the features by placing some of the structures on the backside of the wafer. So, again, for us, that relative contribution and the relative investment in our types of technologies is going up and that’s another thing that’s helping us.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks, both.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joseph Moore: Thank you. In terms of the view that you have been more resilient going forward than you have been in the past, would you say that’s true for memory in isolation, and I guess, if we sort of -- if we think this is a memory downturn that looks similar to 2019, should we think about WFE being down similarly to 2019 or do you think that would be too pessimistic and why is that? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Joe. The first part, I guess, I haven’t thought of it like that, but I would say that, we are resilient -- more resilient philosophy or position would play to memory only. And the reasons that I would point to are, first, the backlog that we have talked about, even though memory may be weaker than it was last quarter. We still have significant quarters of backlog for memory customers. So that dynamic is the same and the overall backlog strength is one of the reasons we are saying we are more resilient than in other periods. And the second is the Services business is one of the reasons that we are thinking that we are more resilient and that also applies to memory customers and customers that we service from a spares perspective, et cetera. So I think that also is larger than it has been in the past and is more resilient relative to changes in WFE. And then the last piece, just to make sure for everybody else, I wasn’t implying that 2019 would be the P&L for the company. We won’t go back to 2019, but that it was a good proxy for how gross margin and spending would behave if we were in a weaker environment. So just to clarify that.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Joe, this is Gary. I think, if you say what’s changed or what’s the same and what’s changed? Certainly, the percentage of foundry/logic is significantly higher than it was back in that timeframe. Again, it’s tracking around two-thirds. There’s this race for leadership in high performance logic and significant investments that are happening in that part of the market. And we see customers -- our customers announcing longer term agreements with their customers and that’s something that we didn’t see back in that timeframe. So I think the foundry/logic percentage and the relative strength there is definitely different than, certainly than it was in the 2019 time frame relative to the overall wafer fab equipment market.
Joseph Moore: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho: For taking my question. My question is on, another question on China. When I look at the revenue from China, it came down about 7 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. I think that’s more than some of your peers. Can you walk us through the dynamics there, I know in answering a previous question, you talked about the new export restriction have no impact in the July quarter. Maybe you can talk about the demand strength from domestic Chinese customers versus multinationals and the foundry versus memory, that will be great? Thanks.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Sidney. This is Brice. Yeah. I think one specific driver and one just general observation. The specific driver is most of the downside on our Display business relates to customers in China, so that’s the probably the primary change element. The rest is just the ins and outs normal quarter activity. We don’t think the China market, as we look forward, is any weaker. We think the ICAPS investments that are being made there are largely on schedule, no real change in signal there. So it’s just the ins and outs of having different-sized deliveries in the quarter. It happened to be a quarter overall that was a little smaller than the prior quarter. So we would point to Display and then just general ups and downs for the rest of the change, and just to reiterate, no change on the -- no change because of the trade rules like we said before.
Sidney Ho: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton: Really ask you a clarification and then a quick question. The clarification is, when you talk about memory reschedules, are these memory customers just pushing out delivery dates by some number of quarters or are they canceling the tool entirely and you are just taking that slot and reallocating it out to one of the foundry/logic customers? The question is just on the memory rescheduling, is that equally happening across DRAM and NAND or is it predominantly on the DRAM side? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Okay. Quinn, thanks. On the clarification, there are both -- there are all three events happening with basically all customers, so there’s adds, there’s drops and there’s schedule changes. I think on the memory, there’s more drops than there are adds in the short-term window. So those are cancels and there are plenty of reschedules and there are even some adds for memory. So I hope that clarifies, it’s a mix. But, overall, we would say, memory cycle-over-cycle memory is lower than what it was in the last cycle.
Quinn Bolton: And it’s equally across DRAM and NAND?
Brice Hill: That part I don’t have off the top. I don’t think we would specify that. So I can’t answer that one.
Quinn Bolton: Understood. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: For you, Gary, since a lot of the industry questions have been answered. You talked about the above average growth in your Process Control business. Obviously, foundry/logic is a big driver of it, particularly on the advanced node side, are you seeing any penetration in terms of your ICAPS business in Process Control or is it entirely within the advanced nodes?
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Patrick. Thanks for the question. No. ICAPS is very strong for our -- ICAPS is very strong overall for the company. PDC is up 67% in 2021 and we are up almost 40% in fiscal 2022. What I would say, relative to the breakdown of the different markets, certainly, it’s stronger in high performance logic than in any other part of the market. Although, we are seeing growth in memory and we are definitely also seeing growth in ICAPS. The biggest thing for us, if you look at our PDC business last year, eBeam pretty much doubled. So we have vertical integration with our electron optics, leadership in resolution and imaging technologies and that business is also very, very strong into 2022 and then also going forward. We are seeing incremental strength also in optical inspection and we believe we will outperform the overall market in optical inspection and overall PDC has a really strong tie to PPACt inflections. So when you look at gate-all-around or some of these other big inflections, our unique imaging capability enables us to map out those processes in fingerprints faster and better than anyone else. So that synergy, not only do we see really strong growth in PDC, but real strong synergy with the rest of our semi portfolio.
Patrick Ho: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thanks. And Operator, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Asking a WFE question, two follow-ups, what would be your revenue guide if you had all the components that you needed to shift to demand?
Brice Hill: That’s a good question, Mehdi. Since it’s been several quarters since we have been at that level. It’s difficult to predict. But we did say, I think, two quarters ago that the supply constraints probably impacted us by $300 million. So I would say that and more if we had zero supply constraints and we would be on a higher curve going forward.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you. And of your inventory, how should I think about the mix of WIP and finished system -- or finished goods?
Brice Hill: Well, the changes for inventory, it’s relatively balanced across the both, across the entire inventory ecosystem. But the increase -- I am looking at the number, sorry, right now…
Mehdi Hosseini: Yeah.
Brice Hill: … relatively balanced, I mean here’s what’s happening on -- here’s what’s happening dynamically. We have a much more raw inventory coming in as we are trying to solve the supply chain issues and 95% or more of our parts are available and we are able to build inventory and that shows up in our WIP in raw material. And on finished goods, what’s happening is we do have material or tools that are complete or nearly complete that are awaiting one part or close to being shipped to customers and that inventory is also growing. So I think it’s relatively balanced across all those components.
Mehdi Hosseini: So the push out by memory customers is not a factor in driving your increase in days of inventory?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Absolutely not. We are still underserved in total relative to the market. So when any customer delays a tool or cancels a tool at this point, we will be moving that inventory and those parts to another customer and we expect that to be the dynamic for the next several quarters plus.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you. Thanks for detail.
Brice Hill: Yeah. And just to emphasize for everybody, yes, we -- that’s what our perspective is on output. We will be raising our output for the next several quarters and we expect to be able to ship that based on demand being higher than the current supply.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Mehdi, for your question. And Brice, would you like to give us a summary?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Absolutely. So we have talked about puts and takes, weakness and areas of strength in the market. The overall story is we have multiple quarters of backlog. Job one for us is to increase our output and meet our customer demand as quickly as possible. As we do this, we will incrementally increase both our revenue and gross margin in coming quarters. We are confident in the long-term growth of the semi market and we are working to increase our investments in supply chain, and especially to continue to focus on the R&D to drive the power, performance and area cost road maps of our customers. I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming conferences. Gary and I will be at the Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco, and just before that, I will be in New York for the Citi and Evercore events. Okay. Mike, please close.
Michael Sullivan: A replay of the call is going to be available on our website -- I’d like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5 o’clock Pacific Time today and we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-05-19 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir. 
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's second quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. Applied will host its next Master Class one week from today on Thursday, May 26th, at 9 o'clock Pacific Time. We'll introduce you to new IMS solutions for chip wiring that solve the resistance challenges of EUV scaling. We'll detail how the industry can build backside power distribution networks that increase logic density by up to 30% at the same lithography. We'll introduce you to new developments in hybrid bonding and heterogeneous integration and will translate these inflections to our product road maps and growth targets. We hope you'll join our technology experts for presentations and Q&A. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. The global semiconductor industry and Applied Materials continue to navigate an unprecedented set of challenges. Demand for semiconductors has never been stronger or broader while the industry's ability to fulfill this growing demand remains constrained by ongoing supply chain issues. I would summarize Applied's second fiscal quarter of 2022 as a two-part story. During February and March, we successfully resolved some key component bottlenecks only for this progress to be offset in April as COVID-related shutdowns further disrupted already stretched supply. These shutdowns are impacting a small number of our suppliers and ultimately delayed around $150 million of revenue in the quarter. Today, our number one priority is to work quickly and creatively across the supply chain to bring more industry capacity online. I would like to recognize the hard work and commitment of our global team and our suppliers, who are doing everything possible to meet our customers' needs. In my prepared remarks, I'll cover three key topics. First, the supply situation and how we see this evolving over the coming months. Second, the near-term demand environment and why we believe this remains strong and sustainable. And third, our long-term view of the markets, the industry's roadmap and Applied Materials unique and differentiated capabilities that together create a rich landscape of opportunities for our company. After that, Brice will provide more color on our financial performance and share some of his initial impressions. Brice has been with us for eight weeks, and we're delighted to have him on board. He brings deep and broad experience to our leadership team at this critical time for Applied and the industry. Let me begin with the supply side of the equation, which is our biggest area of focus in the near-term. The supply situation continues to present multiple challenges that we are working hard to address. Our key issues are shortages of silicon components as well as certain other parts that go into the subsystems of our tools. We are doing whatever it takes to deliver for our customers from sending Applied resources to supplier sites, qualifying alternative parts, investing in our supply chain to working with customers in creative ways to accelerate shipments, including merging system modules at their sites. In addition, we're collaborating with customers using our technology enabled services to fast track the start-up and qualification of equipment once it arrives at their fabs. For reference, if you map out a typical timeline, starting with the shipment of a tool from our factory and ending with the first production wafer out in the customer's factory, the time to install and qualify tools for high volume production can take months. We are seeing strong customer pull for new ramp acceleration services to cut down that valuable time significantly. A positive consequence of our current challenges is that our supplier engagements are becoming much stronger. Not only are we partnering with our suppliers to overcome near-term constraints, we are also building more robust solutions to support industry growth over the coming years. As we focus on the needs of our customers, by addressing part scarcity, expediting deliveries and adding labor in our factories in the field, we are incurring additional costs that are impacting Applied's near-term financial performance. As issues are resolved and we implement effective long-term solutions, transitory cost headwinds will abate. We're also taking actions to improve value capture, including price adjustments. Turning to the demand side of the equation, our outlook remains positive. The picture for 2022 is clear. We have the orders booked, a full build plan and a large and growing backlog. We believe unconstrained demand for wafer fab equipment would be $100 billion or more. The key question is how quickly supply issues can be mitigated and how much the industry will actually be able to ship this year. The primary focus for our customers is now securing supply for 2023. The visibility our customers are providing is both longer term and more detailed than in the past. On this basis, we currently see 2023 remaining strong and being higher than 2022. There are several additional factors that give us confidence in this assessment. First, end demand for silicon continues to grow, driven by content growth in existing and new applications; second, fab utilization is very high even as newly installed capacity comes online. Based on almost 10 years of analytics, this is the highest quarter for industry utilization on record; and third, customers are starting up new capacity faster than ever. Essentially, all tools are being installed by our Applied Materials service team as soon as they arrive at customer fabs, which we have not seen before. As we think about demand sustainability, we also take into consideration the broad-based composition of wafer fab equipment spending. In 2022, we expect foundry/logic to make up more than 60% of total WFE investments. This spending will split relatively evenly between the most advanced nodes and ICAPS, production for the IoT, communications, automotive, power electronics and sensors markets. ICAPS demand has grown significantly over the past several years, and we see sustainable investment by these customers. The edge applications are consuming more and more silicon. One example is automotive, where the global average silicon content is now $600 per unit, almost twice as much as in 2015. And this will continue to grow with the adoption of electric vehicles. Another example is a 5G phone that has 40% more RF content than a 4G handset. The need for extreme power efficiency and battery-powered edge applications is enabled by innovation in materials and structures and is driving an increase in layers and process steps. Over the longer term, advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration also support sustainable demand for ICAPS nodes, as chip designers can use the optimal node for power, performance and cost for each chiplet in a system. ICAPS customers are more focused on innovation than ever, and we are meeting these needs with new application-specific products. One example is an implant, where over the past five years, we've introduced 10 new systems developed for specific ICAPS applications. While navigating near-term challenges remains our top priority today, we are not losing sight of the bigger picture and long-term opportunities. It's now consensus within the industry that there's a clear path to a $1 trillion semiconductor market before the end of the decade. That would represent a high single-digit compound annual growth rate from where we are today. In other words, it took the industry more than five decades to reach $0.5 trillion of annual revenues and we will add another $0.5 trillion within the next six to eight years. We feel even better about where Applied Materials sits within the ecosystem. Because technology complexity is increasing, we expect equipment intensity will remain at today's level or increase further over that period. As a result, WFE will grow in line or faster than the overall semiconductor market. Then within equipment spending, major technology inflections are enabled by materials engineering, shifting more dollars to our available market over time. We described the industry road map that will deliver future improvements in performance, power and cost of semiconductor devices as the PPACt playbook. While different companies have their own version of the PPACt playbook, the fundamental components of the road map are the same: new architectures, new 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink and advanced packaging. Within each of these five pillars, clear technology inflections are emerging that can be quantified in terms of impact, value and timing. At our recent master class, we described the industry's transition from FinFET to gate-all-around, which is a new 3D structure. Applied has the broadest portfolio of solutions to enable next-generation transistor technology. With the gate-all-around inflection, the total available market for our transistor product portfolio grows by more than 15%. Based on our tool of record positions, we expect to increase our share of that available market by more than 5 points. And in terms of timing, we expect to start ramping shipments next year. In our next master class at the end of the month, we'll talk about wiring and chip integration innovations. Contact and interconnect are in both major focus areas for our customers, as they develop new materials and new 3D structures, including backside power distribution networks. Between the 7-nanometer and 3-nanometer node, contact metalization steps are growing more than 50%, and our total available market is expanding almost 80%. For interconnect layers, process steps are being added even faster, and we expect our revenue opportunity to approximately triple. We'll also provide an update on our momentum in advanced packaging. At the investor meeting a year ago, we said, we expected to double our packaging revenue between 2020 and 2024. Today, we believe we're on track to hit our 2024 packaging revenue goal one year early by winning more than 60% share of our served market. Beyond equipment, we are delivering and capturing more value with advanced services. Facing both supply constraints and record fab utilization, customers are seeing significant benefits from using our proprietary parts management and service We see this reflected in our results as AGS delivered record revenue in the quarter, up 15% year-on-year. Before I hand the call over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. Semiconductors are the building blocks of the model world, making them more strategically and economically important than ever. Today, the entire industry is working hard to keep up with the world's rapidly growing consumption of silicon. Demand for Applied's products and services is strong, sustainable and broad-based. We anticipate our ability to fulfill this demand will remain constrained by ongoing supply chain challenges in the near-term with incremental improvements beginning in our fourth quarter. Our number one priority is to continue working collaboratively with customers and suppliers to bring more industry capacity online. We are making progress in key areas, although it is not yet visible in our results. Longer term, we see incredibly exciting opportunities as secular trends create opportunities for Applied to outgrow the semiconductor market by enabling the PPACt road map with our differentiated portfolio of materials engineering solutions. Now, I'll hand the call over to Brice.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Gary. First, I want to thank the Applied Materials team for such a warm welcome. Across the company in manufacturing R&D, the business units, operations and functions, people have shared their enthusiasm for the business and invested in helping me get quickly up to speed. The company's dedication to its mission and its customers is tangible in every setting, and I'm thrilled to be included. I've been working in the industry for almost 30 years now. And being new to Applied, I'll share a few of my observations so far. For most of my career, semiconductor technology advanced almost like clockwork and became the engine of global economic growth and productivity. We all knew the playbook. Looking to the future, the semiconductor road map is fundamental to rapid advances and competitive differentiation in all fields, including health care, transportation and education, where we will leverage massive data collection and analysis and do so using less energy and resources. But today, many people are concerned that the growth and benefits we envision are at risk, because the traditional playbook has stalled, making progress more difficult and uncertain. Applied focuses on exactly this problem, working closely with its customers to identify and invest in the materials innovations we need to create a new playbook and a new road map and enable higher semiconductor performance, lower power consumption and lower cost. So it feels great to be a part of this team and this important mission. Now I'll share three of my first impressions. First, the company is highly execution focused. The team has used its in-depth understanding of the global semiconductor ecosystem to battle almost daily challenges with chip and component availability. The manufacturing teams have been flexible and relentlessly hard working to deliver for customers in a way that inspires my confidence that we will resolve these issues. Over time, I'd like us to smooth out the heavy quarter end production schedules to make us less vulnerable to supply disruptions. Second, Applied's roadmap extends well beyond the emerging technologies we are talking about today. And this gives me confidence in the industry's ability to continue to drive performance, power and cost for many generations into the future. When I was on the customer side, I didn't realize just how much capability there is. Third, the business is highly efficient in terms of capital intensity and operating spending. It's a great model with an excellent return on invested capital. I'm excited to work with Applied's investors and analyst community, and I hope to meet many of you in the near future. On today's earnings call, I'll provide more context on Applied's financial performance, position, and outlook and emphasize three key messages. One, demand is very strong, both in the short-term and long-term. Two, we are supply chain constrained, but we are poised for growth as the situation improves. And three, we are confident in the future of the industry and increasing our capacity to support the growth we and our customers see ahead. Now, I'll summarize Q2 results. First, we generated revenue of $6.25 billion, which was up 12% year-over-year. However, revenue was 2% below the midpoint of our guidance because a COVID lockdown in a key region resulted in a number of our suppliers. To size the impact for you, if the COVID shutdowns had not occurred, we would have exceeded the midpoint of our revenue guidance. We met our non-GAAP gross margin target of 47%, which was down 70 basis points year-over-year as the higher input costs we have been experiencing flowed through inventory and into our revenue shipments. We increased non-GAAP operating profit dollars by 8% year-over-year to $1.91 billion, benefiting from revenue growth. Operating margin of 30.6% decreased 110 basis points year-over-year due to higher R&D and infrastructure spending. We grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 13.5% year-over-year to $1.85, which is $0.05 below the midpoint of guidance due to the supply chain constraints. Operating cash flow declined to $415 million in Q2 because shipments were back-end weighted during the period and because we increased raw material and work in process inventory. Year-to-date, operating cash flow as a percent of revenue was in line with our historical performance. During the quarter, we returned over $2 billion to shareholders, deploying $1.8 billion to repurchase 15 million shares of company stock and paying $211 million in dividends. During the quarter, we announced a new $6 billion stock buyback authorization and increased the dividend by 8.3%, marking our fifth consecutive annual dividend increase. Next, I'll summarize our segment results. We continue to generate strong orders in Q2 in both semi systems and AGS. Our backlog continues to grow and we have visibility from our customers extending into 2023 and beyond. Our semi systems revenue grew 12% year-over-year, but was about 3% below our expectation due to the COVID-related supplier shutdowns. Semi systems non-GAAP operating margin declined 200 basis points year-over-year due to increases in manufacturing costs and R&D program spending. In AGS, our teams went to extraordinary lengths to keep customer factories running at high utilization, which is particularly difficult in the regions impacted by COVID lockdowns. We delivered record revenue and exceeded our segment revenue guidance, growing 15% year-over-year. We also increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points year-over-year. The ability of AGS to deliver sequential growth in Q2 demonstrates the recurring nature of Applied Services business. As a reminder, around 87% of AGS revenue comes from services, parts and software. And this strong services mix enabled AGS to grow despite the supply chain disruptions affecting wafer fab equipment. Our strategy is to grow the subscription portion of our services business, which gives us predictable revenue, brings us closer to our customers and generates over three times the revenue per tool. I'll share some of the metrics we use to gauge our progress. In Q2, the Applied Materials installed base grew by 8% year-over-year and is over 40,000 systems. The systems under subscription agreement grew by 11% year-over-year to over 15,000. The average tenure of our agreements grew from 2.3 years last quarter to 2.5 years in Q2. And the subscription renewal rate was 92%. Next, our display revenue was at the midpoint of our revenue guidance, up 2% year-over-year. And we increased non-GAAP operating margin by 390 basis points year-over-year. Recently, however, there has been weakness in consumer demand for products like smartphones, PCs and TVs. As a result, display equipment demand has softened. And we are making adjustments to our revenue outlook and curtailing our spending in line with the demand environment. We will manage the business with the goal of maintaining healthy cash flow even at lower levels of revenue and operating margin. Next, I'll address how we are preparing for our longer term growth opportunity. Today, we are working with our customers using much longer planning horizons and receiving better long-term visibility. We are working closely with our supply chain partners to remove bottlenecks and increase capacity. And we are adding incremental capacity at our R&D and manufacturing sites to increase longer-term efficiency and output. As a result of these efforts, we expect to achieve a more robust supply chain and manufacturing capability along with deeper strategic relationships with our customers and suppliers. Now I'll turn to our guidance for Q3. We expect revenue to be $6.25 billion with a wider range of plus or minus $400 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be around $1.77, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect semi systems revenue of $4.48 billion, a number that is well-below demand and assumes the supply chain constraints will persist during the quarter. We expect AGS revenue of $1.43 billion, up 11% year-over-year and display revenue of $310 million. We project non-GAAP gross margin of 46%, non-GAAP OpEx of $1.06 billion and a non-GAAP tax rate of 12%. Finally, I'll comment on our gross margin outlook beyond Q3. We expect to gradually increase our gross margins beginning in Q4 through a number of actions that include pricing adjustments, manufacturing cost reductions, logistics improvements and product reengineering. Over time, as the supply chain recovers, we expect a number of transitory costs to abate and to ship higher volumes and a richer product mix. We are fully committed to achieving our longer-term gross margin targets. In summary, our demand outlook is very strong in the short term and in the long term. And we are investing to further strengthen our strategic customer relationships and drive profitable growth and shareholder returns. Mike, please begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have another question, please re-queue and we’ll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. You may proceed.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess the question is, given supply constraints and rising backlog, how are your commitments with key subsystem suppliers evolving? And given these commitments, how are your contracts and engagements with your customers evolving as well? It sounds like, in the prepared remarks, you talked about smoothing out build and shipment plans. And I'm curious, does this mean a vision to work from a longer lead time permanently? And does this mean upfront payments from customers? I would love to hear your thoughts there. Thank you.
Brice Hill: Great. C.J., thanks for the question. A question about supply constraints and commitments from suppliers and commitments to our customers. Starting with the supply side of the equation, we've been working tirelessly with the entire supply chain to improve output to get toward the levels that we see later in the year and through the horizon on the growing WFE demand. On the commitment side, we've definitely made lots of progress. We look at the situation as frustrated by the lockdowns that we've described. But most of these problems are being solved. And we expect to gradually increase output as we get past this quarter that's right in front of us. If we think about our customers, we've talked about how orders are at the highest level they’ve even been. We’ve talked about how our backlog is increasing. We're not intending to change the commitment in terms of deliveries to our customers. We're working instead to open the aperture on supply and begin working down the backlog, as we start to get more of the critical components in. And we've described our Q4, as we think past Q3 and into Q4, we expect to gradually increase revenue from that point on. So no changes from the customer commits. We'll work on improving the performance as we get the supply chain open, and we've made tons of progress with our suppliers.
Gary Dickerson: Hi, C.J., this is Gary. Yes. What I would add is that, relative to the customer visibility, it's better than ever. A lot of our customers do have longer-term contracts with their customers. And so, we're unfortunately booking all the way into 2024 at this point in time. But as Brice said, we're definitely driving our supply chain to improve delivery times for customers. That's priority one. But I would say our visibility is significantly better. And actually, the conversations that we have with customers relative to visibility is further out than we've ever seen.
C.J. Muse: Thank you, very much.
Brice Hill: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. You may proceed.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to ask about the backlog in orders. So you said the backlog is strong. Is the backlog at record levels right now, or has it been stronger in any of the prior quarters in the past? And I know you talked about your – obviously, you're shipping some tools. They're missing modules. How much revenue would you have in that backlog that maybe represented by tools that have already been shipped and actually just waiting for final modules in order to recognize that revenue? I guess, I'm trying to get [Indiscernible] - how much like where the backlog is and how much of it is actually like really baked at this point?
Brice Hill: Yeah. Thank you for the question. I think the first question, we're not – we've actually seen the backlog continuing to grow. So that's been a dynamic that's been consistent for the last quarters. And it's not something we're celebrating. We're looking to open the aperture and begin supplying at a faster rate and work the backlog down. But at this point, we still have more than two quarters of backlog looking forward. As far as the missing modules go, we won't specify exactly what the overhang from quarter-to-quarter is, but you've got the right dynamic. We are shipping a number of tools that are missing one or two parts for the accountants and the investors. We cannot recognize revenue until we complete those tools. So as we work through the quarter, we work to complete all of the tools we've shipped at customer. There are some that are incomplete. We haven't recognized revenue for those. Those go into the next quarter as we get the critical components. It's not a significant overhang. And I wouldn't look at it as necessarily a head start into the next quarter. When we think about our guidance to the next quarter, we have carefully mapped out all of the supplies from our supply chain and how they'll help us close the machines that we need to complete in the field and also the orders for the quarter, and so when you think about that overhang, it's not overly significant, but it does exist. Thanks for the question.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I think you quantified $150 million. That's if I heard correctly in terms of demand and output for Q2 in semi systems. I was hoping you could give us that delta for Q3. And given that, we are kind of past the halfway mark for your fiscal year, how should we think about the floor for WFE this year? Is it something closer to $90 billion instead of $100 billion, or is it a different number, assuming the supply situation doesn't dramatically improve even in your Q4?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Vivek. So on the – on the overhang for the quarter or on the [unshipped] (ph) for the quarter of approximately $150 million, that's the right number. We think if – and that goes specifically toward the lockdowns in April. That hit us in the last month of the quarter. It affected – we have a significant number of our builds in the last month of the quarter. So it definitely put a bump in the supply chain for us. And we think we would have exceeded our guidance had that not happened. When we think about Q3, again, we've mapped out all of the key components into Q3. And what I want to communicate here is, we are forecasting and relying on the factories, our supplier factories, to continue to reopen, continue to be staffed and the shipping lanes to continue to open from that area of the world. And we have intelligence. We have the ramp plans. We have the product plans. So our forecast is built on that. So when you think about the delta for Q3, I would say that, we've done our best on the guidance side. Our capability and our demand is much higher than our guidance for Q3. So, what you see there is a forecast that's metered, if you will, by the speed the supply chain is going to pick back up. And that's why we're also saying we expect in Q4, we'll say for today that we expect incremental improvements, and we'll see how this resolves for the quarter. And then on the last piece, on WFE, we're sort of running at the same rate. You can look at our last few quarters. We've sort of been running at the same rate. You know that last year was a $87 billion WFE. We're probably running today at today's speed in the low 90s from a WFE perspective. So, we would say that's the floor because as you know, we continue to get orders. We have a long backlog. So, at this point, it's just how much can we crank it up as the supply chains open in the Q4, Q1 timeframe. Thanks for the question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. You may proceed.
Mark Lipacis: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, you said that -- I believe you said that you were building tighter relationships with your suppliers. And Brice, you used an expression that I was not familiar with, opening up the aperture on supply. I was wondering, could you just spell that out? What does that mean to open up the aperture on supply? And how does that help you close the gap between the demand you have and your ability to supply? And Gary, when you talked about building tighter relationship with your suppliers, my understanding is you get subsystems also so then you have suppliers and our suppliers have suppliers. And I'm wondering if you could just kind of spell that out. Like how does like that manifest in mechanically in helping to avoid the situation you're in right now in the future? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Thanks Mark. This is Brice. I'll just make a quick comment on the open the aperture concept there. So, what I'm thinking is if you look at our inventory position, our inventory increased $500 million quarter-over-quarter. Our capacity is high, higher than where we're operating today. And our backlog is very large. So from my perspective, we're poised to grow quickly. And what we need to do is get the supply chain on the key components operating. We need to ramp the factories in Shanghai, get the supply chains open and keep going. So, the concept there was just if you think about the aperture of a nozzle or a hose or something like that, just open it up faster so that we can actually execute what we're prepared to execute. And I think the best place you can see that is in our inventory position looking forward.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Mark, on the supplier relationships, probably the biggest thing that we're doing differently now is the multi-tier visibility in our supply chain. So, previous to this situation, we never really had to focus on chips and components that are deep in our supply chain. So, now we have that visibility and just very strong and fast support from our biggest customers to close those gaps. But again, those gaps, frankly, are still coming. One of the situations we just encountered in this lockdown -- COVID lockdown that happened on March 28th, we had wafers that were completed from one of our big customers and they were packaged in that region. And again, prior to the situation, we would have never known those wafers were going into that region. But I would say that what's encouraging to me is the engagements we have with those suppliers. We're also extending our planning horizons with those suppliers. We have tremendous focus within all of our different business units with tremendous engineering horsepower focused into the supply chain. So we've made actually some tremendous improvements in fundamental bottlenecks over the last few months. But you can't see it, again, because of the COVID lockdown that started for some of our suppliers on March 28th. And that went on for several weeks really with no people in those factories. And even today, some of those suppliers have significantly less than 50% of the people back in the factory. So this multi-tier visibility is dramatically better. The engineering horsepower we have focused and really, the joint problem solving, I'd say, with our suppliers, it's really been great. There's been tremendous support, really joint problem solving. I just have tremendous appreciation for the focus and the work that all of our suppliers are doing. And Mark, we are making progress again as Brice said, the biggest uncertainty right now is in this COVID lockdown, how quickly is that going to resolve is really the gating factor for us in terms of incremental improvement.
Mark Lipacis: Very helpful. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen. You may proceed with your question.
Krish Sankar: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats, Brice, on the new role. I have a big picture question for Gary. Gary, clearly demand has been strong. And you've been supply constrained for a long time. It seems like that has been the theme from semi and semi-cap companies for the last nine months or so. Now let's just say, assume for argument's sake, demand actually slows down in calendar 2023. So from your experience, Gary, where would you see that impact WFE first? Would it be mature nodes? Would it be China? Would it be memory WFE or something else? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Krish, thanks for the comment. It's Brice. I'll take a shot at this first and see if Gary wants to add anything. The first thing I want to say in case someone joined and didn't hear the situation early. The situation that we see today is that we're getting more and more orders each quarter. Our backlog is increasing. Our customers are calling us, telling us to speed up. And our customers' customers are calling us to speed up. And when we look at utilization, we've talked about this in previous calls and Gary mentioned it in his overview. When we look at utilization, we track utilization of equipment across the entire industry in all applications, in memory, in foundry, in ICAPS, et cetera. And we see utilization at record levels. So finding my way back to your question, you asked where would we see any change if the environment turned. We think the first place we would see that is you wouldn't get new orders. So the fact that we're getting such a high degree of new orders says that not only our customers trying to reschedule their orders or thinking about a different schedule on their own, they're actually adding to it. The second place we would see it is, there's been discussion of some of the consumer demand, companies may be having less demand. But the second place you would see it is actually wafer starts and we’re not seeing it there either. So we're not getting any of those signals. But to be -- answer directly, we would see it in the new orders slowing down. I think that would be the first place we see it. We're not seeing that today.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Krish, this is Gary. What I would add is that, I have numerous conversations with a number of different CEOs and really the focus of those conversations is on supply. And in many cases, they do have long-term agreements, multi-year agreements with their customers. And the first priority is tools that they need to qualify for that incremental capacity with all of those customers. But again, the thing I would say that's different from what I've seen in the past, I'm meeting some of our customers' customers. And they're describing really what they need relative to chip content and innovation in the leading edge. Certainly, again, a lot of the conversations are also in the ICAPS space, where those customers have multi-year contracts and visibility, again, with those customers. So I think that's probably the biggest thing. I've never seen that in my entire career in the industry.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Brice. Really appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about pricing, both the timing of some of the adjustments that you guys talked about and also the scope of some of the adjustments. On the timing dynamic, Brice, I guess, you're guiding fiscal Q3 gross margin to 46%. Any pricing adjustment or the impact from pricing embedded in that number? And if not, should we expect some of the tailwinds to show up in fiscal Q4 and into fiscal 2023? And then on the scope of some of the pricing adjustments, maybe one for Gary. As you have these discussions with your customers, should we expect positive pricing in your leadership products, primarily and not so much in the areas where you have more competition, or are customers receptive to pricing adjustments in areas like etch and, say, process control? Thank you.
Brice Hill: Thanks, Toshiya. I'll start with that. So on the pricing, first, I'd like to communicate that we're doing everything we can to offset the cost side of the equation. So we've got more than a couple of points of headwind over the last few quarters and being off our model. And those things go to things that we've described as we've gone along. It's the labor and overtime. That's higher expense. It's the materials inputs. It's the freight and expedites that we're having to pay. And because we can't get all the tools out right now, there's a little bit of a mix impact. When we think forward in our 46% gross margin guide, it does include some pricing improvements in Q3. And those will grow over time as they get more traction and we work those across along with the cost reduction efforts we have for the company. So as we think about Q4, we're focused on improving logistics, improving the supply chain, making cost reductions with some of our key projects in terms of reengineering and finding more commodity solutions for some of our products. So those are all things that we'll do to bend back the cost side of the equation and help us and help our customers. And then on the pricing side, you'll see that increase over the coming quarters, gradually helping each of Q3, Q4 and then Q1. And then on the scope, I think the scope is very broad, and I'll let Gary comment on that.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Toshiya, what customers are really focused on with Applied is really the first focus is accelerating capacity and really closing the gap between supply and demand. So as Brice mentioned, there's a number of different headwinds there. Customers all understand that. They want us making those investments. And everything that we can do to help them accelerate chip output is a major focus. And then the other thing, I would say that, and by the way, the May 26 master class, I would really encourage many of you to come and see that. The wiring innovations are really one of the biggest bottlenecks in the entire industry. And Applied really has many differentiated unique technologies to solve maybe what's the biggest bottleneck in entire industry for power and performance. But obviously, technology, innovation and value pricing, Toshiya, is also key for our customers in terms of driving innovation and creating value. So anyway, those are the things that our customers are focused on. And as Brice said, it's not limited in terms of scope.
Toshiya Hari: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Given all of the supply chain disruptions and component shortages that you and your peers are going through, how is this impacting the overall semiconductor industry? In other words, foundry and logic all had plans to expand capacity to a certain level to close the industry supply-demand gap. But how much slower will capacity grow with all of the equipment shipment delays this year and next year relative to your customer's targets? And then in memory, right, for DRAM, do you think that your customers are going to be able to expand bit supply by targeted 15% to 17% or NAND output by 28% to 30%? It seems as if all of this is just going to result in a longer time to close the semi industry supply-demand gap. I know, you guys have a good sense and a large team that monitors industry capacity expansion. So I wanted to get your views.
Brice Hill: Yeah. Thanks, Harlan. This is Brice. I'll start on that one. So we do think you're right from the perspective of the growth has been metered this year for sure. And so I think we talked about one of the earlier questions kind of the level we're running from a WFE versus what the natural level will be if we can open things up and speed up in Q4 and Q1. So I think the way we would think about it is we're a few quarters behind what raw demand is, and that's probably what's happening across the industry. When we think about the sustainability of the demand, we study all the end markets, as you've described, all the different ICAPS markets, the edge devices, the leading-edge logic area, et cetera, including the memory components. And we see – we see a consistent growth across the horizon from a demand perspective. So this just looks like it’s the supply chain situation is going to meter the beginning of the cycle. And it gives us confidence as we think forward over Gary mentioned that we're starting to look at demand into 2024. We have high confidence that as we ramp up, that demand will continue through 2023 and even into 2024 as the industry works to work on its backlog and work on catching up to the real demand that's underneath.
Harlan Sur: Helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I think this is the fourth straight quarter you've hired over 1,000 people or added to your headcount. And I assume a lot of these are manufacturing on site. But semi systems revenue obviously hasn't really changed over that time period. So, I guess when I think about the margin structure, how do we think about the cost absorption or the magnitude of that cost absorption relative to maybe the price adjustments that you're putting through as we think about the improvement in margin over the next several quarters?
Brice Hill: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think, first of all, on the hiring, you're right that there's a significant amount of manufacturing hiring as the flow in manufacturing isn't perfect at this point as we have to react to sort of less predictable inventory and supply. And we have burst of manufacturing to meet the customer needs. We also highlighted earlier in the call that we're actually working a number of reengineering projects to improve both the cost profile and the use of alternate parts for some of our products. And we have to do the reengineering and the qualifying of those products. So, that takes personnel. We're also actually helping some of the suppliers with -- improve situation. That takes personnel. And then of course, we're continuing our growth trajectory. Looking at the WFE going forward, we have lots of projects underway from an innovation perspective to continue the roadmap. So, we're continuing on that path. And it's a fair question whether we should in the current environment, but we're definitely looking at the environment as supply constrained. We're going to solve those problems and get back to the growth that we've been forecasting. And we're ready to do that with both inventory and manufacturing capabilities. And on the last point, from a gross margin perspective, it is one of the headwinds in the gross margin. I listed four headwinds. I'll just say them again. It's freight and expedites, labor and overhead, and material, cost and mix. So, as one of those components, we look at those as approximately equal in strength if you want to think about how that looks against our gross margin. Thanks for the question.
Joe Quatrochi: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You may proceed.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Brice, I was wondering if you can help us shape revenue through the rest of the year. You had guided April to $6.35 billion, and you said that this is three or some months ago, I know that you weren't there then. But the company had said that revenue would grow kind of mid-singles off of that level throughout the rest of the calendar year. So, off that baseline that sort of implied $6.65 billion for July and about $7 billion for October. So, we're coming at about $400 million light of that for July. So, the question is, can I push that $400 million into October so that October is sort of maybe in the low to mid-7s? I guess I'm just asking you to help us sort of, like reshape the year just given that you had shaped it three months ago. Thanks.
Brice Hill: Thanks for the question, Tim. When we think about -- let's start with the guide for this quarter, when we think about the guide for this quarter at $6.25 billion, what we did was we carefully have worked through the supply chain to find out how quickly will the factories -- our suppliers' factories restaff? How quickly will the supply lines open? When are the exact delivery dates that we'll get through the quarter? Will we get them early enough to make the quarter, et cetera? So -- and we've got a slightly wider range. You'll see to recognize that we're forecasting based on a continued and accelerating reopening schedule that is our best intelligence today. So we've got some risk there. When we think forward to the next quarter, we're going to enter the also no inventory on those critical components because we will have used all that inventory to satisfy our Q3 demand. So when we think about Q4, we're saying it is gradually or incrementally larger than Q3. So I think -- thinking of the previous discussion, we don't know yet what Q4 will look like, which is one of the reasons we won't guide it. It will be metered depending on how quickly the supply chain opens up in Q3. We have the manufacturing capability in Q4 to go much faster. We have the inventory on the non-constrained components to go much faster. So there's a wide range of possibilities for Q4. And we just need to continue progress on the key components and lockdown factories in Q3 if that makes sense. And the last thing, I will say though that there's not any perishable demand for us. As you think about one of your questions, would you push that forward? I absolutely think you will push it forward. Nothing will parish in this situation. It's just going to be metered in Q4 by where we are with the supply chain. Thanks for the question.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. You talked a little bit about weakness in display in this coming quarter tied to smartphone. Can you just talk about -- it looks like you're going to track to down double digits this year. What's going to return that business to growth? Is it just smartphone, anything from kind of an application or a technology perspective that will lead that business to grow down the road?
Brice Hill: Thanks, Joe. This is Brice. I'll start and maybe Gary will make a comment about the long-term there. So this is the one place in the business where we have seen some impact from the change in consumer demand at this point. So definitely, weakness in the outlook for display for the next few quarters corresponding to what's been characterized as weakness in smartphone and PC and TV, et cetera. And so what we're doing is resizing the business from a spending perspective to make sure that we can deliver the amount of cash returns that we've been delivering for the past few years and still leave us ready to grow as the demand picks back up and some of the new applications pick back up. So you'll see us make those adjustments as we go forward and the next few quarters will be a lower revenue number, but it will still be a good return on investment. Last thing I'll say there is, most of our investment has largely been made in that business. So we're able to deliver to customers and execute against investments that have been made. So it's a good cash flow business, good cash returns, and that's sort of our perspective. And it does leave us ready for new demand on some of the new applications. Gary, if you want to comment?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Joe, thanks for the question. So as you mentioned, this year, double-digit, well probably be down roughly 10% versus where we've been in -- will be down about 10% this year. And as Brice said, we really have resized our spending. We've made a lot of investments. I think, as you know, we have very, very high share in the parts of the market that we participate in. But we are committed, as we've discussed in our investor meeting, to returning free cash flow from this business. And so we'll be, as Brice said, able to deliver similar free cash flow even at a lower level. I would say, right now, if we looked out into 2023, we don't really see strengthening today in terms of where that market is going. We will be able to continue to deliver similar levels of free cash flow with the resizing that's in progress. And that business really is leveraging semiconductor deposition technology into larger panels. One thing that's also another synergy for us. If you look at the advanced packaging road map, going to larger substrate sizes, there is technology and display that will strengthen our already strong position in packaging in the longer term. So there are synergies there. It's a good free cash flow business. Longer term, some of the OLED technology barriers, once those are solved, we could see a step up back in that market. But we really don't see that over the next several quarters.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the services business, the AGS revenue in Q2 came in better than you expected. And I appreciate all the metrics you disclosed in your prepared remarks. But considering last quarter, you talked about supplies constraints impacting the 200-millimeter product line. Can you talk about what drove the upside? And the follow-up to that is, you previously suggested low double-digit growth for AGS in fiscal 2022. Has anything changed there? Can you touch on the risk that COVID lockdowns may have on AGS? Thanks.
Michael Sullivan: Yes. And operator, this will be our last question that we'll have time for, just so you know. Thanks Brice.
Brice Hill: Okay. Thanks for the question. Yes. On the services business, thanks for the question. I think it is important to recognize that the business did grow quarter-over-quarter, 5%. And it did grow 15% year-over-year. And our investors probably know, it's been a key part of our strategy to shift more and more of our services business to the subscription format, because that's better for our customers and it lets us plan better also and provides them more technology, advice and capability. So when we think about the indicators that we give for that business, that portfolio is getting stronger and stronger. And when we see the supply constraints for the rest of the business, it's not surprising to us that that recurring revenue, the way that business is set up is low beta or a little bit more resistant to changes in the rest of the business. What drove the upside was really the high utilization across the ecosystem. There is still a transactional element to that business. And when we talk about utilization across 200-millimeter, 300-millimeter, all of the different product types, it's just 92%, 93%, 94% record levels we talked about. And that drives spares and parts and service components across the entire ecosystem. So that's really where you see the strength in the quarter. We would have been even higher had we had more supply, but we're working on that. And the last piece on COVID lockdown, I guess that was related to supply. So we do think the business could have been stronger in Q2. And we would have served more parts on the parts side of the business. But it's a first priority for us, and we're working on improving that as we look forward. Thanks for the question.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Sidney, this is Gary. Just another point, one of the things that's driving our growth in subscription revenue, subscription services. Our customers are really focused on increased output. So we have part management services. And I can tell you that, many of those customers that have those services are very happy. They don't have shortages and they're increasing chip output. We have managed services to increase yield and optimize productivity for good chip output. That's another one we see tremendous pull from our customer's. And by the way, this is driving increased headcount as we're supporting some of these service opportunities. And then the other thing is ramp services, ramp acceleration services, time to ramp, as I said in my prepared remarks, is months for many of our customers. So every week that we can accelerate the time for those tools to drive chip output, everybody is focused on that. So there are a number of these services that are increasing our subscription percentage, increasing our subscription revenue. Again, that's really in the theme of everybody's focused on good chips out as fast as they can.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thanks, Gary. And thanks, Sidney. Brice, would you like to give us your closing thoughts for today's call.
Brice Hill: Absolutely. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, everybody, for joining. Important messages today, demand, very strong, sustainable. We're committed to improving our gross margins and committed to our long-term model. We're working hard to improve our supply situation every day. And I just want to say I'm eager to meet some of our investors. I'll be at the BofA conference in San Francisco and looking forward to that. And Gary will be at the Bernstein conference in New York in two weeks. Thanks, everybody for joining.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thank you, Brice, and we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-02-16 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir. 
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's first quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. Applied will hold its next master class on Thursday, April 21, at 9:00 Pacific Time. We'll cover patterning technologies for the chip-making industry, including 2D scaling with EUV lithography, materials-enabled patterning of gate-all-around transistors and 3D patterning control using e-beam technology and AI(x). We hope you'll join our technology experts for presentations and Q&A. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. This is an unprecedented period for Applied Materials in the semiconductor industry. Demand for semiconductors has never been stronger or broader, and the supply chain's ability to fulfill this growing demand is constrained in the near-term. While the supply environment remains challenging, we landed our first fiscal quarter of 2022 towards the high end of our guidance range and delivered our highest ever quarterly revenues. These results are a testament to the capabilities and commitment of our global team who are executing well and focused on doing everything possible to deliver for our customers. The industry clearly has a long way to go before supply catches up with demand. Applied's orders for the quarter were an all-time high, beating our previous record by $0.5 billion. To ensure our own manufacturing capacity is not a limiting factor, we've made and continue to make strategic investments in our global infrastructure. This includes our state-of-the-art logistics service center in Austin, Texas that we're bringing online this month. Like many in the industry, the biggest challenge we face today is the availability of certain silicon components that go into subsystems within our products. We are working closely with our suppliers to find solutions and eliminate bottlenecks. I would like to thank them for their partnership, as we collaborate in new ways to overcome near-term headwinds and build a stronger supply chain that better supports the future needs of the industry. In today's call, I'll talk about our demand outlook, which is very strong and strengthening. I'll provide our longer-term perspective on the secular trends reshaping the semiconductor industry. And I'll give you some updates on the progress we're making against our strategic goals and how we're positioned to outperform our markets over the coming years. Later in the call, Bob will share his perspective on the state of the industry and our financial outlook. Let me start with market demand. It's clear that wafer fab equipment spending in 2021 was limited by supply with some unmet demand pushing into 2022. If we look at our semiconductor systems revenues from the second quarter of 2021 to the end of Q1 2022, and compared to the prior 12-month period, they were up 43% year-on-year. We think this is a good approximation for industry growth in calendar 2021, which would put WFE in the mid-$80 billion range. Demand is very strong and continues to grow. We believe wafer fab equipment spending could reach $100 billion in 2022. And since we are already close to being sold out for the year, we also have a positive growth outlook for 2023. Within WFE, foundry/logic spending grew faster than memory in 2021 and we see it growing faster than memory again in 2022. We believe foundry/logic made up more than 60% of total WFE investments last year and will remain at these levels or increase as a percentage of the mix over the next several years. Innovation at the edge and in the cloud means that foundry/logic demand is broad-based and split relatively evenly between the most advanced nodes and ICAPS customers who serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power electronics and sensors markets. It's also important to put this near-term demand outlook in the context of the secular trends driving longer-term growth and structural changes in the industry. While digital transformation is already reshaping the global economy today, it will take decades to fully play out around the world, and that the foundation of this multitrillion-dollar inflection is advanced silicon. Today, 9 of the top 10 most valuable companies in the world either design or build chips. Eight of the nine are now designing their own customized silicon in-house, and the other one manufactures a large percentage of the world's chips by value. I think this is a great example of the fundamental role silicon plays in driving the system level, power, performance and cost improvements that will unlock the full potential of digital transformation and the metaverse. Back in 2018, we introduced our framework for describing the semiconductor industry's future technology road map. We call this the new PPACt playbook and said it had five key elements: new chip architectures like workload-specific ASICs; new 3D structures like gate-all-around transistors; backside power distribution; next-generation 3D NAND and 3D DRAM; new materials in gate, contact and interconnect; new ways to shrink from EUV lithography to advanced patterning; and advanced packaging from 2.5D silicon interposers to 3D chiplets and hybrid bonding.  As the major technology inflections that make up the PPACt playbook takes shape, it's clear this future road map is more multifaceted and complex than anything the industry has done before. This increasing complexity has positive implications for Applied Materials. First, we expect capital intensity to remain at the levels we have seen over recent years; and second, Applied's broad capabilities are more valuable because they allow us to address higher order problems for customers and provide them with more complete solutions. On top of the opportunities created by the PPACt playbook, major supply chain inflections are underway that are also positive for industry economics. This starts with a shift from just-in-time to a just-in-case philosophy. The most visible example of this is the automotive industry where the major carmakers are quantifying the cost of lost business in 2021 and rapidly changing the way they work with suppliers of their most critical components. We're also working differently with our customers. They are providing us with longer-term visibility, and we are collaborating more closely on capacity planning. In addition, the strategic and economic importance of semiconductors is being recognized at a national level. In the coming years, government support and incentives in the US, Europe and Japan will translate into regionalization of supply. As I've highlighted before, these regional supply chains will be more resilient but also less capital efficient, which is an additional tailwind for us. Overall, our outlook for the next decade is very positive. We expect semiconductor and wafer fab equipment to grow significantly faster than the economy with outsized opportunities for Applied Materials. To be ready for this exciting future, we've aligned our organization and investments around three strategic pillars. First, to be the PPACt enablement company and provide the foundation for customers' road maps for power, performance, area, cost and time to market; second, to shift more of our business to subscriptions; and third, to generate incremental free cash flows and profitability from our businesses in adjacent markets. Earlier, I talked about key technology inflections that make up the PPACt playbook, gate-all-around, backside power distribution, 3D NAND, 3D DRAM, new materials and the gate contact and interconnect and advanced packaging. All of these inflections are primarily enabled by materials engineering, Applied's core strengths. And as a result, they grow our total available market. Thanks to our relentless focus on developing differentiated technology to enable these inflections, we are also in a great position to capture more of that growing TAM. For example, in the transition from FinFET to first-generation gate-all-around, our transistor TAM grows by more than $1 billion per 100,000 wafer starts per month. And based on our tool of record positions, we expect to capture the majority of the inflection. We will provide more details about these inflections and how we expect them to play out in our 2022 master classes. While our current supply constraints mean that we can't fully realize the strength in our business, we are executing very well against our product road map, and there are clear leading indicators of our future growth potential. I'll highlight a few recent examples. In etch, we've recently won multiple tool of record positions at advanced nodes and foundry/logic across all three leading-edge customers. This is significant because these wins are in areas we haven't served in the past and demonstrate how our next generation of etch solutions address customers most challenging applications. In inspection and metrology, where we have fewer supply chain constraints, our trailing 12-month revenues were up 68% year-on-year, and our e-beam revenues nearly doubled in that period. We expect to outperform the market again in 2022 with especially strong growth in optical wafer inspection, combined with further extension of our e-beam leadership. Beyond unit process excellence, Applied is able to combine the industry's broadest technology portfolio and unique ways to create co-optimized and fully integrated solutions. For example, co-optimization of hard mask, deposition and etch is an enabling solution for high-aspect ratio structures. Adoption of our co-optimized Draco solution is accelerating generate an incremental $600 million of revenue this year. And we recently secured our first wins with a new carbon hardmask deposition and etch solution at a leading memory manufacturer. Another key component of our technology portfolio is our digital tools that accelerate R&D, technology transfer and ramp, and optimize productivity and high-volume manufacturing. We are engaged with a broad range of customers. In this quarter, we secured a new strategic penetration for R&D acceleration using our AI(x) actionable insight accelerator platform at a leading customer. As part of this engagement, we will use our unique sensor technology and proprietary machine learning algorithms for rapid process window tuning and process variability reduction. We're also making progress on our multiyear journey to increase subscription revenues. Within AGS, more than 60% of our parts and service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term service agreements. The average tenure of these agreements is now 2.3 years, up from 1.9 years 12 months ago. And the renewal rate is over 90%. In addition, when we look at our combined software business in AGS and semi systems, which are also subscription-based, we expect them to generate more than $300 million of revenue this year. Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'll quickly summarize. Applied and our global teams are executing well in a challenging and dynamic environment, and our near-term focus is on doing everything we can to expedite deliveries to our customers. Demand for semiconductors and wafer fab equipment remains strong and continues to grow. There's still a long way to go before supply catches up with demand. Our outlook for 2022 and beyond is very positive as long-term secular trends drive our markets structurally higher. In addition, the major technology inflections that make up the industry's PPACt road map expand Applied's addressable market opportunities in our broad and differentiated technology portfolio puts us in a great position to capture a larger portion of our served markets in years to come. With that, Bob, it's over to you.
Bob Halliday: Thanks Gary. I'd like to begin by thanking our teams and our partners for doing everything they could in a challenging supply chain environment. We still have a lot of work to do to satisfy our customers' needs, and this is job one for all of us. I have three main messages for you today. One, demand for Applied's products is very strong and continues to grow. Two, we remain supply chain limited, and we forecast a gradual improvement over the course of the year. Three, we expect to grow our revenue and earnings each quarter through the end of the calendar year and we believe it is increasingly likely that 2023 will be another growth here. Next, I'll summarize our Q1 results, then I'll provide details about the demand environment for Applied Materials, and finally, I'll share our guidance for fiscal Q2 and the rate of growth we expect to see throughout the year. In Q1, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth and exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. The supply chain environment was challenging. Our teams collaborate broadly with partners upstream and downstream of Applied to maximize the supply of components to our manufacturing sites and service locations. This work enabled us to deliver record semiconductor systems revenue, which we grew by 29% year-over-year. We grew fastest in foundry/logic year-over-year, and we continue to expect foundry/logic to outgrow WFE in 2022 with strength in both leading edge and ICAPS. From a product perspective in Q1, we generated record quarterly revenue in process control, CVD and CMP. And we achieved our highest ever DRAM revenue. We also grew non-GAAP operating margin in semi by 280 basis points year-over-year. In AGS, we grew revenue by 14% year-over-year and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 110 basis points. About three quarters of AGS' year-over-year growth was in recurring revenue. Our AGS service revenues grew sequentially and year-over-year. We increased our tools under comprehensive service agreement by 13% year-over-year. And our subscription renewal rate was 92%. Our parts business met our expectations but could have been even higher. AGS includes our legacy 200-millimeter equipment revenue, which was below our expectations in Q1 due to supply chain constraints that prevented us from shipping to demand within the quarter. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect AGS to grow in the low double-digits, with potential upside depending on the supply chain recovery. In display, we exceeded our revenue goal in Q1 and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 280 basis points year-over-year. Summarizing Applied's Q1 results on a year-over-year basis. We increased revenue by 21%, non-GAAP gross margin by 140 basis points, non-GAAP operating profit by 270 basis points and non-GAAP EPS by 36%. In addition, we generated record free cash flow and distributed over $2 billion to shareholders, with $1.8 billion in repurchases and $214 million in dividends. Next, I'll address the impact of the supply environment on our business in the near-term. Underlying demand for Applied's technology is very strong and growing. And we believe that as we work through the supply chain constraints, we will demonstrate the progress we're making toward our market share and gross margin targets. Although we don't usually report backlog on a quarterly basis, I'm going to give some further color on today's call to help you understand our confidence. In Q1, our semi systems backlog increased by more than $1.3 billion to a record $8 billion. Moreover, the backlog includes a rich mix of products that are highly enabling to our customers' road maps. What this tells us is that in an unconstrained environment, we would have produced substantially higher revenue and demonstrated a healthy share gain in calendar 2021. Also, absent the supply chain issues, our gross margin in fiscal 2022 will be very close to the targets in our 2024 financial model. We are laser-focused on improving the supply chain, which will enable us to support our customers and demonstrate the strength of our business. As Gary outlined, we expect the WFE market to grow by over 15% in 2022 to $100 billion or more. Even with the constraints, we expect to outgrow the market in our semi business and carry sizable backlog into 2023. Now, I'll share our guidance for Q2. We expect to increase revenue to $6.35 billion, plus or minus $300 million, which is up almost 14% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS in Q2 to be around $1.90, plus or minus $0.15, which is up around 17% year-over-year. Within this outlook, we expect semi systems revenue of around $4.6 billion, up16% year-over-year; AGS revenue of around $1.35 billion, up 12% year-over-year; and display revenue of around $380 million. Applied's non-GAAP gross margin should decline to around 47% in Q2, as we absorb near-term cost pressures primarily related to expediting shipments to our customers. After Q2, we expect to gradually increase the gross margin by mitigating cost pressures and shipping a richer mix of high-margin products. Non-GAAP OpEx should be around $1.015 billion in Q2, and our non-GAAP tax rate should be around 12%. Looking ahead, we expect we can grow revenues by increasing mid-single-digit percentages each quarter through the end of the calendar year. And based on customer conversations about semiconductor demand and technology inflections, we're increasingly optimistic that 2023 will be another growth year for the industry and especially for Applied. Now Mike, let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have a second question, please re-queue and we’ll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a question on gross margins, particularly in the current challenging supply environment. You guided 47% and expectations for that to grow through the year. Can you speak to what it'll take to build out greater scale upstream for your key suppliers? What impact that might have on input cost for you and then your ability to pass those down to your customers? And what gives you the confidence that you can get to that 48.5% as part of the target model? And, I guess, as part of that, if you could frame what your expectations are when you might be able to hit that type of number? Thanks so much.
Gary Dickerson: Well, let me take those six questions, C.J. So first, what's going on with gross margins? What's the outlook and what can we do? So what's going on with gross margins? As you know, in Q4 of 2021, we did 48.2%. The long-term model in 2024, I guess, it is, is 48.5% at $87 billion, 48.8% at $100 billion. We were around 47.3% this quarter. We guide around 47%. We go up half a point the other year. There are two things that are hitting us. One is cost increases from logistics, inefficient factory ops -- operations like overhead and burn absorption; and thirdly, some material cost issues. I'd price those in at 1% to 1.5% on gross margin impact, probably about 1.2% to middle point. I would say that most of those are transitory, factory absorption, logistics and a bunch of the material cost stuff should get better. So I'd say, over two-thirds of that is kind of transitory. The second one is mix. We have a couple of mixers. We have very, very strong orders and backlog, particularly in semi. So if we had a higher mix of semi versus non-semi, we help our gross margins. Secondly, if you had a better -- if you look -- we priced out the mix of our semi backlog. So our mix in the semi backlog is very attractive. So if you look at those two mix things and you normalize by past backlog levels, well, we could ship. You pick again another 1 to 1.5 points of gross margins. And again, the sweet spot is kind of 1.2. So if you're at 80, 47 next quarter, if you could get 1 point to 1.2, you're pretty much on model. You might be above it a little bit actually. So that's the scale of what we're looking at. So we're pretty confident we're on the model trajectory of 48.5% at $87 billion and 48.8% at $100 billion WFE. Secondly, the cost increases, can we do anything to mitigate that and pass it along? With customers, our three primary issues are; one, we have to do better on deliveries. Job one for us is to ship more tools, get them out the door on time to customers, and that's our commitment to customers. Secondly, for a long time, we have created really valuable tools and shared that value with our customers and ourselves. And I think we've done a good job on both sides. Now that we have these unusual cost pressures, I think it's fair to have that discussion with customers. But job one and job two is to get our product shipping in volume on time and also to create value for customers. But I think we can have that type of conversation.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Bob, I just wanted to clarify and be crystal clear. So you said you saw through the year, you could grow by increasing mid-single digits. Do I read that as the actual percentage of sequential growth as we go through the year goes up every quarter? So the sequential growth is actually accelerating itself through the year?
Bob Halliday: Yes. It's kind of -- it's roughly five, seven. And then in the fiscal Q1, we think around nine. That's semi. And AGS and display are similar type of numbers. So the overall number is pretty close.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That's helpful. And I guess any…
Bob Halliday: And I think that's a fair estimate. We still got to work through issues, but I think it's a good estimate.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. And I guess along those lines, like what gives you confidence? Is that just your visibility on how the supply constraints themselves are easing? Like are you shipping, for example, like partially done tools, or you just have to supply like a final module or something to make it work? Like what gives you the confidence that the supply constraints will actually ease along that trajectory?
Bob Halliday: Well, if you look at total material receipts for us in Q1, they were up a good amount, but we didn't get exactly to match of parts. We -- they were up kind of mid to high-single digits. And if you look at that type of increase in Q2, we think that's similar. But I think we'll have a better match of the parts. You remember what you said last quarter was, there's a lot of stuff we're tracking, but the hotspot is kind of some semi device type things that are supplied through the distribution channel to our customers. So we think it's a fair estimate of what we could do. It's not internal capacity constraints. It's more some parts in the supply chain. And I think it's a reasonable estimate.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you so much.
Bob Halliday: You’re welcome.
Michael Sullivan: Yes. Thanks, Stacy. And then those numbers are right for semi systems. We would say that AGS year-over-year -- AGS tends to grow a little bit slower than semi systems. So it's probably just up low double-digits. And then display, you already have our view that it's probably up a little bit year-over-year, also depending on the supply chain, but that'll help you with the 5, 7, 9 for semi, and that gives you the shape of the rest of the revenue.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your question please.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions and congratulations on the solid results. I guess, Gary and Bob, the bookings number and the backlog number in the Jan quarter were extremely impressive, but the cynic in me would argue that when your customers can't get what they want, they always order more than they need. And so from your perspective, how do you safeguard against the fact that you and all of your peers are having supply constraints right now? And if I'm your customer, I at the very least better get in line or I might not get what I need to kind of grow supply. How do you kind of safeguard against the dreaded double ordering?
Bob Halliday: Well, I'll give you my perspective, and Gary talks to customers a lot if he hears. So I think, one, if you look at the magnitude of the orders and how much they're growing, it's a pretty big number. So we're not going to be overbuilding inventory or anything. The second thing is if you look at the mix, I think that's where it's doing. So if you look at memory -- so I'll give you some data, John. So if you go look at the history of the industry the last 15 years, 20 years, some of the leading indicators of when you overbuild is particularly strong memory is three years of a strong memory year. 7, 17 and 18, we're all over 50% in memory. So if you look at it right now, memory was 40% of WFE in 2021 and going down several points in 2022. So we look at memory as moderate growth, and we don't see double bookings there. Second thing is a leading indicator of whether they're overbooking in the short-term, we look at wafer starts and we look at fab utilization. So I said last quarter, fab utilization was at a record at our fiscal Q4. In fact, in Q1, fab utilization is slightly higher, so very high. Thirdly, if you look at wafer starts over the last several years, wafer starts from 2016 to 2021 in memory, DRAM and NAND were both 19%. That's not a compound rate of growth. That's a total growth from 2016 to 2021. If you look at 200-millimeter, it's 70%. If you look at the growth was, it was kind of 300-millimeter stuff, 100% from 2016 to 2021 in logic and foundry, right -- logic/ foundry. So now you go, well – so gee let's look at logic/foundry. So if you look at TSMC has put long-term spending out -- forecast of $100 billion kind of CapEx, $40 billion, $42 billion in CapEx next this year. And we've talked closely to them. I mean they're pretty committed to spend. If you look at Intel, pretty committed to spending announcing new fabs. We're tracking fabs. Last quarter, we started a number of 59 shells with $300 billion of -- 335 -- 300 to 335. That number is up to 68, 365 billion to 385 billion. So if you look at shell counts, you look at growth and starts, you look at fab utilization, and you look at what the foundry/logic guys are committing to who are a little more predictable and you look at memory mix, it's pretty good. Then you look at ICAPS mix versus trailing edge, right? Because ICAPS historically wasn't too big. Now, ICAPS we define as 10-nanometer above, right? So if you look at that, it used to be pretty moderate, because the business model for customers was to roll over tools from leading edge to the trailing edge, and that was enough tools to do trailing edge. But if you look at trailing edge demand, it's through the roof. If you look at the WFE by application base from 21 forward to 26, some of the biggest growth areas are, if you look at, its data center, the accelerators, but it's also automobile, IoT, comms and some stuff in phones, particularly sensors. So there's big demand on this ICAPS sensor stuff. So if you look at it, the demand is there. And the funding of that through tools is not there, because you don't have enough rolling over from the leading edge, because the demand is going up on the trailing edge, right? So then you look at it and say, well, what is actual demand? So we said 53% in 2021 and 2022 for ICAPS. Well, if you drill into 20-nanometer and above, so -- or 10, 14, 16 and look at some of the older stuff, particularly 28, it's gone up as a percentage of WFE from 31% in 2020 to 43% in 2021 and 44% in 2022. So because of two factors, demand going up and less tools to roll over to those. So somebody might say, well, gee whiz, that's overheated. Well, if you look at the rate of increase is declining, right, it went 31, 43, 44. So it's strong, but the rate of increase is declining. So the very long answer, but I gave you data, is I don't think we're overheated right now. We have lots of orders. The mix is the type of mix, it's not crazy mix. Now, you can drill into ICAPS in China a little bit. But I think we're pretty good this year and probably next year.
John Pitzer: Helpful. Thanks, guys.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back. So in Q4, I think you mentioned you were short by about $300 million or so that you were not able to fulfill. I'm wondering what that impact was in Q1, because when, Bob, I applied this 5% sequential growth through Q3, it only captures, I think, $300 million or so of sequential growth. Shouldn't you be growing more than that going into Q3, given the shortfalls you had in Q4 or Q1, or is this still kind of very supply constrained number?
Bob Halliday: It's completely supply constrained. We have more orders than we can ship. If you look at our backlog build was 1.3 billion in the quarter, and our backlog growth is pretty substantial in the next couple of quarters. So we are totally supply constrained as everyone is in the industry. I think $300 million was starting number for what it was in Q4. And I think Q1 could have been more if we weren't supply constrained. And the mix is really good for us in the backlog. Its products like MDP, APTD and DDP and products like that.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Bob Halliday: You’re welcome.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Vivek.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Bob, I just wanted to touch base again on the supply constraint. The semi industry has been constrained for a while, but you and your equipment peers have been experiencing it for a few quarters now. And it seems like now you're talking not just to your suppliers, but their suppliers and also a few levels below that, and some of whom might end up being your direct customers as well. So I'm kind of curious, has that level of depth in your supply chain giving you better insight into when these issues could abate? And is that what is informing your mid single digit sequential for the next few quarters in semis?
Bob Halliday: Yes. I'll give you some more color than yes. So we buy -- an average tool has got about 5,000 discrete parts for us. And then those parts have many subcomponents down to our level of suppliers. And so some of our suppliers on MRP, some of them run build to stock, stuff like that. So our historical visibility in today builds and material and their supply chain was limited. We've gotten into a lot more depth to understand our suppliers, suppliers, suppliers, which goes back to our customers. It's kind of a circuit route. And at many times, they get their parts from our customers through distributors, not directly from our customers. So as we have gotten visibility into this, we've gotten a much more in-depth understanding of the choke points and ways to manage this tactically and, frankly, long-term strategically. So I think our visibility is a lot better. Our management is getting incrementally better every quarter. And how we think about it strategically long-term, I think, is a very big benefit to the company. So yeah, we got, again, better visibility. I think we're tactically managing better. We're not out of the woods yet, but I think there's going to be long-term benefits to the company in terms of our depth of understanding.
Krish Sankar: Thanks Bob.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Krish.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about some wins in the etch market in areas where you historically didn't compete all that much. You talked about the advanced nodes across FoundryLogic. You also talked about inspection and metrology and how you've done well there on a trailing 12-month basis and the outlook into 2022. When you think about those wins and the momentum you have, how should we think about your overall WFE market share in 2022? I realize in the near-term, you're still supply constrained. But once supply eases, should we expect you guys to outperform the market this year and perhaps into 2023?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Toshiya. No question that the areas that you mentioned, etch, PDC, are significant opportunities for us both now and going forward. I'd say the biggest thing for us is capturing the inflections. We talked about gate-all-around, wiring. We mentioned a few months ago bringing a new tool to market, seven different technologies and an integrated platform to lower wiring resistance by 50%. And that one platform -- combined platform is worth billions of dollars. So you've got the transistor to process the data, wiring to connect the data, all of the technologies associated with those inflections. We gave some examples around capacitor, scaling in DRAM, the CMOS logic, also inflection in memory. All of those inflections are really, really great opportunities for Applied. Really, the unique thing for us when you look at whether it's the leading logic, ICAPS, Memory, packaging is another one where we have over 50% share of our served markets, we have very deep visibility into all of those inflections. And it's really about creating materials to enable the electrical performance, shaping those structures, modifying the materials, analyzing to really drive the T and the PPACt for our customers. We're in really -- we've never been in a better position in any of those different areas. In the specific products you mentioned in etch certainly, that's been a really great growth platform for us. The Sym3 etcher has significant technical advantages, higher conductance with a larger chamber volume, unique materials on our chamber wall so we can provide better defects and better yield. And again, really, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, not only are we doing really well in memory there, but we're gaining significant share -- double-digit share at all the leading foundry/logic customers. PDC, that was another one that you mentioned, really tremendous growth in PDC, 68% in terms of the overall revenue growth. A really significant position in E-beam -- or E-beam overall, the review, inspection, measurement where we doubled in 2021. We have significant leadership there. In 2022, we'll have significant growth not only in E-beam, but even faster growth in optical wafer inspection. So I would say on the unit processes, we're in a really great position. And really, what I'm most excited about is our ability to capture these big inflections that I talked about in the prepared remarks. Relative to what you see in the revenue growth, and Bob mentioned that earlier, you just can't see it because we can't ship it. And also what Bob talked about earlier was that our backlog -- we're booking into 2023, especially in some of our leadership areas. Bob mentioned our metals for wiring. And again, big inflections in wiring where Applied has tremendous leadership. epi, implant, that's another one that will grow significantly for us in 2022. So yes, I -- really, we've never been in a better position, Toshiya, than where we are right now. The biggest challenge for us right now is to close that demand supply gap.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you so much.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Toshiya.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I assume that the team is placing orders for both subsystems, parts and chips, basically through the entirety of this year just given the extended lead times with your suppliers. And I assume that you guys have good visibility as to what those suppliers can ship against your orders. So if you put all of that together, can the team need its forward backlog and forecasted customer shipment requirements for this year, or do you think that there's a likelihood that you exit this calendar year with your shipments below your customers' demand requirements? In other words, is the 2022 WFE of 100 billion for you and peers below what your customers require? And if so, like what do you think is the true 2022 equipment demand profile?
Bob Halliday: Sure. Well, you've got a couple of questions in there, Harlan. Mechanically, what we do? Two, the visibility. And three, what do we think unconstrained demand is in 2022? So if you think about how we do it, we send signals to the supply chain through MRP. And they say they can meet or not meet. Frankly, they are struggling to understand what they can meet more than a quarter or two out because it's their suppliers, right? So I think visibility is kind of gray. So we mechanically do it, but nobody is sure, right? The second thing is -- but we see improvement, right? The second thing is what do we think unconstrained demand is? I think the tactical question you asked, too, could we go out of the year with demand still north of supply? Yes, we could. We're into 2023. So I think our backlog probably grows throughout our fiscal year. If you go look at unconstrained demand, I think, WFE 100 billion is defined as what we ship for the industry. And you see our competitors are also constrained this year, and they're booking into 2023. I think unconstrained demand is several billion more than 100. I think it's less than 110 billion, but it's more than 100 billion.
Harlan Sur: Yeah. Appreciate the insights. Thank you.
Bob Halliday: You’re welcome.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. You had mentioned that you're opening a new logistics center. I was wondering if you could help us understand, does that give you added capacity, or does that also help on the cost efficiency side? And then, are there some start-up costs that we should be thinking about that are embedded in this quarter's gross margin guidance?
Bob Halliday: That mostly helps efficiency of shipping, receiving, moving things around. It doesn't do much to our costs, because our volumes are up, so the cost that we absorb into the burden. And so as a percentage of cost, it doesn't have much impact. We probably, frankly, will do further expansions in the next year or two. But I don't think it hurts our cost, helps our -- affect us in efficiency.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. And Bob, just a follow-up. So what do you think gross margin does between Q2 and the end of the year? And is it impacted at all by that build-out?
Bob Halliday: Yes, I think gross margin is probably about 0.5 point from the Q2 guide to Q4. And I think what we just mentioned doesn't have really any impact.
Joe Quatrochi: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I have a question just on the shape of the year in terms of WFE and sort of how to think about -- Gary, you talked about WFE intensity. And the question really is, how much semiconductor revenue can this WFE backstop. So if you take everyone's reporting, and they've sort of commented on Q2 as well, it seems like we’re doing about 45 billion here in the first half and maybe 55 billion in the back half, something like that to get you to a 100 number. And I think in the past, Gary, you talked about 14% WFE intensity. So that would have to support like $800 billion in semiconductor revenue. And this year, if we're lucky, we're going to be at kind of $650 billion. So I'm just wondering, if you agree with all that math and sort of how you think about maybe how far out in front of semi WFE is. Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Well, yes, thanks for the question, Tim. In terms of WFE or the capital intensity, the number is definitely higher than 14%. If you look at all of these big inflections that the customers are ramping, the capital intensity is probably around 18%, I would guess, right now, but definitely higher than the 14% number. I'll let Bob come in, in here in just a second. But just one example is, in wiring resistance where that is one of the biggest areas of focus for all of the foundry-logic customers. If you look at back-end interconnect steps from 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer, they're increasing by about 2x. Now the other thing that's happening -- and by the way, it's also increasing in not only foundry-logic, but also in memory. So that -- again, that's just an example -- to get that 50% reduction in wiring resistance, it's pretty complex. That complexity also impacts the output of the system. So not only are you seeing step -- steps increase, but you're also seeing a reduction in output. And then certainly for Applied, our metal deposition products where we have a very, very high share, that's an example of a really significant driver for us and one of the factors on why we're booking into 2023 for those products. And Bob, I don't know if you want to add any more color.
Bob Halliday: Sure. It's a good question, Tim. I think the 14%, 15% is running a little higher. I think sustainably, you're at a good 15%. If you look at the trend lines and just split it out, WFE intensity, just WFE divided by customers' revenues, if you look at FoundryLogic, DRAM and NAND, FoundryLogic is the most, and it's trending up for a couple of reasons, leading edge and because of there's not enough tools for the trailing edge. So the revenue dollars, take more WFE and you can sort of see customers talking about that too. And you see customers like TI who haven't spent in years having to add trailing capacity so the CapEx as a percentage of WFE of revenues trending up. If you do a rough cut and you think with this FoundryLogic mix with more ICAPS, with more greenfields and technological inflections around 3D and gate-all-around, which will drive a little more spending, I think 15% is kind of new normal, frankly. If you look at electronics spending in 2025, it's about $780 billion. So if you take 15% of that, you're about $117 billion WFE in 2025. So I think kind of sustainable growth rate is high single digits for WFE, and it's driven partly -- and half of that has got a capital intensity, half is growth in wafer starts. And if you drive the capital intensity at 50%, I think the numbers all kind of worked to high single-digit sustainable cross-cycle growth rate for WFE.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Thank you Bob.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Tim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the nature of the supply constraints a little bit. Last quarter, you talked about it being mostly programmable logic. Have the challenges broadened out from there? And I guess how is it that there's so much visibility that this is going to continue to be constrained to the end of the year? Like shouldn't -- I would think you're the highest utility user of a lot of these chips. Is it possible that you could get -- you could get move up in the queue and get these products before the end of the year?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Thanks, Joe. I'm living this every single day relative to going deep in the supply chain with all of the components that are constraining our output. I really think the guidance we've given, Bob talked about relative to quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter improvement, is really in the ZIP code of where we're going to land. We definitely have much, much deeper visibility even than we had -- we were on this call a quarter ago. As Bob talked about, from a chip perspective, in a lot of cases, these chips are buried down in components. They come from our customers through distributors, and they really don't know the end destination for those chips. As they learn that where the constraints are, they've certainly responded in helping to resolve those issues. But there are just a number of those different constraints. I wouldn't say it's only chips. They're also other areas of the industry. I mentioned again in our metal deposition products where the -- really the demand has just went up so much higher than where they were. There are other components that are also constraining us. But I think that we do have much deeper visibility. And what Bob said earlier, I think, is also true. We will come out of this stronger. I think there's no question we'll have better visibility. We have very -- we'll have deeper relationships with our suppliers. So again -- but I think from a ZIP code standpoint, the ballpark of what Bob talked about in terms of the incremental growth quarter-on-quarter is about right. Again, it may not be exactly those numbers, but that's really the relative trajectory.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. My question is on the memory side of the WFE. I think you guys reiterated your view that memory WFE will grow but less than foundry and logic. But based on some of the comments you had earlier, you're looking at the kind of low teens growth rate for memory. Just curious, has your view changed much given the memory market seems to have improved in the past three months or they are so supplied constraint that you can really service the upside? And maybe just one more. I think last quarter, you talked about the demand side it's up but DRAM is down, is there any update to that as well? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Sure. Good question, Sidney. I think that there's two reference points for our view of DRAM NAND, growth foundry/logic and the mix. And I think our views changed a little bit since last quarter, I think last quarter our outlook for 2022, we’re probably a little low on outlook for China, and we're probably a little low on DRAM in particular. So if you look at our reference point, we now believe that in a constrained environment, which is kind of the $100 billion number, we think that DRAM and NAND are kind of flattish from 2021. Maybe down a tiny bit, but kind of flattish and if you look at foundry/logic, that's the biggest growth and we think that increases from 60% to several points higher than that in terms of mix in a $100 billion environment. So number one, I think we're more positive on DRAM and NAND, DRAM, particularly than we were last quarter. And we are more positive on overall WFE in 2022 than we were last quarter. I think we still remain positive on foundry, but DRAM probably had the biggest delta on our view from last quarter. And then in an unconstrained -- and I don't think they're growing too fast, frankly. If you look at fab utilization by memory and DRAM, it's pretty darn good. So I think they're okay. And I think it's a little more second half weighted.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Sidney.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Sid.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, couple of follow-ups. Bob, you were making references, I think it was the trading niche or ICAPS. You were highlighting 43% of the WFE mix in 2021 and 44% in 2022. Was that -- did you mean to imply that trading niche or entire ICAPS as a percentage of WFE?
Bob Halliday: What were the two choices, again, Mehdi?
Mehdi Hosseini: You highlighted 31% mix for 2020, 43% for 2021 and 44% for 2022. I'm just trying to understand what you were referring to. What are those mixes?
Bob Halliday: All right. So what we did is we broke down ICAPS a little bit. We define ICAPS as everything, except the leading node. So that's 10 and above, okay? But then I drove into it some more, and I said, I want to look at 20-nanometer and above, including 200-millimeter stuff, because if you look at the last three years, the sales in those have grown. Now, where you particularly had growth is 28-nanometer stuff. So the percentage of foundry and logic that was 20-nanometer and above in 2020 in the WFE numbers was 31%. And then our revenue mix for us, for foundry-logic, pretty similar too. We had 43% for 2021 and 44% for 2022. And where you see the biggest growth year-on-year is 28-nanometers up; 45-nanometers up, the strongest; 90-nanometer, not too much. But we went into depth by node by year. So our conclusion is that -- so the other thing that's interesting Mehdi was, it's gone up, the rate of acceleration has diminished somewhat. And then, if you look at a curve in the out years for ICAPS, leading edge, DRAM and NAND and their share and growing of WFE, you see ICAPS growing in absolute volume. So what also you have to think about is where do the ICAPS tools come from? Not only are the number of devices coming, but we did get the equipment for that. So they used to take that equipment and roll it over from the leading edge. So let's make up an example. So in the leading edge, you might run it for a couple of years, two nodes, and you might roll 90% of the equipment forward to the next node and then 10% for reuse of some gets left behind. But if ICAPS trailing edge isn't growing much, you have most of your equipment for the trailing edge fully depreciated to use on the trailing edge. But an incremental growth in ICAPS, they believe your ICAPS grows 2x. Your capital equipment requirements for it goes up like 10x, relatively speaking, because you don't have that much equipment rolling over from the leading edge. So the WFE spend on ICAPS is driven by not just growth in ICAPS, but the availability of tools to roll into it that generally have to buy new.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. I would say, Mehdi, just one more thing. That's -- a dynamic over the last few years, is you used to have used tools that were available for ICAPS, that's all gone. And more of that has moved from 200-millimeter to 300-millimeter. So all of those transitions have increased capital intensity for ICAPS.
Mehdi Hosseini: Great. If I may have just a quick follow-up, and thanks so much for all the insights, it's very helpful. If I were to think about these mixes, Bob, you referenced, I think the majority of this is actually being installed in China. And we're dealing with the situation that for most of the OEMs, China has become -- domestic China has become more than a-third. So I'm assuming that the investment in China for 20-nanometer and above for logic and foundry will continue, will sustain, regardless of what happens outside of China? Would that be fair?
Bob Halliday: Yes. I think that's fair. The only thing you might look at, Mehdi, which is interesting is, where is the growth in WFE spend by application. And you've got a pretty big growth in the out years for automobiles, IoTs, some of the sensors stuff in phones. So I agree the China stuff will sustain stuff. I agree that the long-term demand is pretty good. I agree that they can't keep growing forever. But I think it's already started to decelerate a little bit in the relative growth rates from 2020 to 2021, 2021 to 2022. And you have to look at that availability of tools to roll over from the leading edge when you look at WFE, because it's a compounding factor.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Got it. Thank you so much.
Bob Halliday: You're welcome.
Michael Sullivan: Yeah. Thank you, Mehdi. And operator, that's all the time that we have for questions. Bob, would you like to help us close off the call?
Bob Halliday: Sure, Mike. I'll give you my three-legged stool summary. You all look forward to those. Number one, demand continues to be very strong. We see our business trending up as we proceed through the year, and we believe 2023 will be even stronger. Number two, Applied's position is very strong. I'm confident that we really make progress with our supply chain; we'll be able to demonstrate that we are very much on track to our market share and our gross margin targets. And number three, even in this constrained environment, we're generating record revenue and operating cash flow, which is fueling strong shareholder returns. Now Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.
Michael Sullivan: All right. Thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5 o’clock Pacific Time. We'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-11-18 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir. 
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer.  
 Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC.  
 Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.  
 And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson. 
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. I'd like to start by thanking our employees for delivering the best year in Applied Materials history while navigating a dynamic and challenging environment.  
 Demand for semiconductors and wafer fab equipment remains very strong. And in fiscal 2021, we generated $23 billion of revenue, which represents 34% annual growth. In fiscal Q4, we hit the midpoint of our earnings guidance despite larger-than-expected supply chain constraints. These constraints worsened in the last few weeks of the quarter as we experienced delayed shipments from several suppliers. Without these supply shortages, we estimate that our Q4 revenues would have been at least $300 million higher.
 We expect supply chain headwinds to persist into fiscal 2022, and mitigating them remains our top priority. For this reason, I'll begin today's call by providing some additional details about the industry's supply dynamics, both near term and longer term. Next, I'll describe the demand outlook, which is very strong and broad-based. I'll then talk about the progress we're making against our growth strategy and how Applied Materials is positioned to outperform the market over the coming years.  
 I'm also happy to welcome Bob back to the CFO seat while we conduct the search for our next CFO. Later in the call, Bob will share his perspective on the state of the business and provide color on our financial performance.
 So let me start with the supply side of the equation. Applied has made and continues to make strategic investments in our own global manufacturing infrastructure, so factory capacity is not a limiting factor for us. Like many in the industry, the primary challenge we face today is availability of certain silicon components. For Applied, our issues are relatively narrow, and we are proactively collaborating with our suppliers and directly with the chip companies to find solutions and work around bottlenecks. I deeply appreciate their partnership and teamwork as we navigate these unprecedented circumstances together. Looking further ahead, I believe we will see permanent changes in the way supply chains are designed and operated.  
 In the semiconductor industry and beyond, there's a shift from just-in-time to a just-in-case approach, which will require higher levels of inventory, more built-in redundancy and more burst capacity. Because the economic value of capturing upside opportunities far outweighs pure efficiency savings, we're also seeing changes in supply agreements across the ecosystem as companies place a premium on having preferential access to capacity.
 In addition, our customers are providing us with longer-term visibility, and we are collaborating more closely than ever when it comes to capacity planning. On top of that, the strategic importance of semiconductors is now recognized at a national level. Over the next few years, as incentive programs become available in the U.S., Europe and Asia, we expect to see a trend towards regionalized supply chains that are more resilient, but also increased capital intensity.
 Now I'll characterize the demand environment, which is extremely healthy. The pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of the economy, fueling semiconductor consumption and driving the need for next-generation silicon technologies. As a result, we see wafer fab equipment spending for calendar 2021 up around 40% year-on-year, in other words, in the mid-$80 billion range and constrained by supply, not demand.  
 There is still a long way to go before supply and demand is balanced, especially as demand drivers continue to grow. We, therefore, expect wafer fab equipment spending to be up again in 2022. While we're currently focused on resolving near-term challenges, it's important to recognize we're only at the beginning of major technology and market inflections that will play out over the next decade.  
 As everything gets smarter from our phones to our cars, to our homes, we see a combination of unit growth and increasing silicon content per unit. For example, if you look at this year's high-end smartphones, by dollar value, the application processor semiconductor content is up about 20% compared to last year's models, and RF content increased at twice that rate. And in data center applications, the average DRAM and NAND content per server is also growing at a 20% compound annual growth rate.
 As more and more smart devices are connected at the edge, they are driving exponential growth in machine-generated data that must be stored, moved and processed. Then to create value from these vast volumes of data, new AI computing approaches are being developed, fueling further demand for current and next-generation semiconductors.
 When I talk with customers, their message is clear and consistent. They are investing strategically to be in the best position to capture value as these long-term secular trends accelerate.
 In our core market, foundry/logic is about 60% of wafer fab equipment spending in 2021, and we expect it to remain at this level or higher over the next several years. Within foundry/logic, the spending mix is relatively balanced between the most advanced nodes where we see a fierce battle for leadership playing out in ICAPS.
 ICAPS node serve the fast-growing IoT, communications, automotive, power electronics and sensor markets. In memory, supply and demand fundamentals remain healthy, and we expect investments to be up next year, although not as much as foundry/logic.  
 Finally, capital intensity is also providing an important tailwind. With the deceleration of traditional Moore's Law scaling and the transition to the new PPACt playbook, complexity is increasing. Simply put, more innovation is needed to get from one node to the next. And this higher complexity translates to higher capital intensity.
 Against this backdrop, I'll now describe Applied's performance and progress towards our strategic goals. In fiscal 2021, we grew semiconductor equipment revenues almost $5 billion or 43% year-on-year, outpacing the market growth rate during that period. However, as I described earlier, we were unable to fully meet demand in our fourth quarter due to component shortages, and we expect to remain supply constrained going into fiscal 2022. As a result, we've grown our backlog at a company level to $11.8 billion, which is up 77% compared to the same period last year.  
 Our near-term results do not fully reflect the underlying strength in our business or the progress we're making against our long-term strategy. As a reminder, our strategy has 3 pillars: first, to be the PPACt enablement company and provide the foundation for customers' power, performance, area cost and time-to-market road maps; second, to shift more of our business to subscriptions; and third, to generate incremental free cash flows and profitability from our businesses in adjacent markets. We've aligned our organization and investments around these critical focus areas and are demonstrating strong momentum.  
 Applied's PPACt enablement strategy is built upon 3 differentiated elements. We have the broadest and most enabling portfolio of unit process solutions. We can co-optimize and integrate these technologies in unique and highly enabling ways. And we're focused on time-to-market acceleration with our AI(x) or Actionable Insight Accelerator data platform.  
 Starting with our unit process tools. Demand in our traditional leadership areas is very strong. Our epi and thermal businesses both grew 70% this fiscal year, and CMP grew more than 60%. And in our targeted growth areas, we expect our process diagnostic and control revenues to be up more than 60% in calendar 2021.  
 Packaging is another very exciting area for us. Our equipment revenues are up more than 55% year-on-year, and we're on track to exceed $800 million for calendar 2021. We're also bringing highly enabling future technologies to market through a combination of organic R&D and strategic partnerships.
 Moving to our co-optimized and integrated products. The customer pull for these solutions is strong and increasing for future nodes. Co-optimization allows us to see and solve higher-value problems for customers, speed up commercialization of new innovations and capture more of the available opportunity. One example is dielectric materials where we're driving parallel innovations in materials deposition, modification and removal. Our CVD group has more than 15 new materials either in development or recently released. These enable new structures or manufacturing techniques in both foundry/logic and memory. The revenue opportunity we've opened up for the co-optimized etch and CMP steps is almost twice as large as the market for the stand-alone deposition equipment.  Another example is advanced patterning where we're co-optimizing CVD, ALD and CMP with our Sym3 etch, enabling us to gain more than 5 points of share in patterning this year.  
 Integrated Materials Solutions, or IMS, go one step beyond co-optimization by combining multiple processes with customized metrology and sensors in a single system typically under vacuum. With IMS, we can target the most complex and valuable challenges in the new PPACt playbook. For example, this year, we delivered 5 new low R, or low resistance metallization integrated solutions to customers that address next-generation applications in foundry/logic, DRAM and NAND. This included our copper barrier seed IMS that combines 7 different process technologies in one system under vacuum, ALD, PVD, CVD, copper reflow, surface treatment, interface engineering and metrology. This enables a 50% reduction in interconnect resistance at the most advanced foundry/logic nodes and creates a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Applied Materials over the next 5 years.  
 The final component of our PPACt enablement strategy is time-to-market acceleration. New digital tools that accelerate R&D, technology transfer and high-volume manufacturing are a major focus area for our customers. In the coming years, these technologies will have a huge impact on productivity and innovation to commercialization speed. They will also play a key role in making regional supply chains economically competitive and sustainable. Our AI(x) platform brings together process tools, sensors, metrology with data analytics and machine learning. We currently have 25 AI(x) R&D acceleration engagements with leading customers, and we now expect that number to triple over the next 12 months.  
 Another highlight for 2021 is the progress we're making with subscription revenues. In our service business, we've already converted a significant percentage of our spares and service revenue from on-demand to long-term service agreements. We now have nearly 15,000 installed base tools covered by these agreements, up 12% year-on-year. The tenure of these agreements has grown from 1.9 years at the end of 2020 to 2.3 years today, and our renewal rate is about 90%. Several customers have highlighted how these long-term agreements have allowed them to better manage disruptions in parts supply and technical support during the pandemic.  
 Before I hand the call over to Bob, I will quickly summarize. As the digital transformation of the economy accelerates, demand for semiconductors continues to grow and is significantly outpacing supply. We expect supply shortages of certain silicon components to persist in the near term, meaning that we don't expect to fully meet demand in Q1. Managing these constraints in partnership with our suppliers and chip makers is our top priority.  
 Looking beyond the near-term disruptions, I feel very positive about the future. Longer-term secular trends are driving the semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets structurally higher. And at Applied, we're making significant progress towards our strategic plans. We are in the best position to accelerate our customers' PPACt road maps and grow significantly faster than our markets over the next several years.  
 Now I'll hand the call over to Bob. 
Bob Halliday: Thanks, Gary. I want to begin by saying I'm very happy for the opportunity to work with all of you again. I have 3 main messages today. Number one, demand is very strong and growing, and I think it's likely to remain strong in 2022 and beyond. Number two, supply chain constraints are impacting our ability to meet all of our demand in the near term. Number three, Applied Materials is making very good progress toward our financial targets, and we're in a great position to return capital to shareholders. I'll cover each of these topics in order and give you our guidance. And then Gary, Mike and I will help with your questions.  
 I'll begin by giving you more detailed insights than we typically share about the demand for our products and its sustainability into 2022. Specifically, our Semi Systems revenue grew by 43% in 2021. Our Semi Systems orders grew by 78% for the year. In fact, our Semi Systems orders grew in every quarter. In Q4, they were up 136% year-over-year.  
 Looking ahead, we currently expect our orders to be higher in the first half of fiscal 2022 than in the second half of 2021 across Semi Systems, AGS and also Display. In short, the demand environment is very strong.  
 What's happening on the demand side is that all of the trends Gary and I talked about years ago are playing out in an even bigger way than we imagined. First, semiconductor demand is higher because we're designing more intelligence into practically everything that gets built and sold. Second, equipment capital intensity is higher. We don't have wafer size increases anymore, and the industry has run out a number of efficiencies, including fab automation, industry consolidation and the foundry model.
 Used equipment is now scarce. So even in the ICAPS markets, customers are buying new equipment and spending more. The industry is adding more wafer capacity to keep up with demand, particularly in foundry/logic, and we believe spending will remain strong.  
 Specifically, the industry grew foundry/logic wafer starts by around 40% over the past 5 years alone. At the end of our fiscal year, overall fab utilization for the industry increased to the highest level of the past decade. We see foundry/logic continuing to grow as a proportion of the industry's mix. Five years ago, foundry/logic represented around 53% of WFE spending. As of 2021, it's grown to 60% of WFE, and we see it being even higher into the future.  
 Even with higher wafer capacity and high utilization, we have a global semiconductor shortage that's affecting a wide range of industries, including our own. Industry-wide, we are tracking 59 fab projects with available and announced expansion capacity of 3.5 million wafer starts. These projects represent potential equipment spending of around $300 billion in future years. All of this data leads me to believe that demand is likely to remain strong.
 Now I'll give you more insights into our own supply situation. In Q4, our Semi Systems backlog was at record levels and growing quickly. In our guidance for Q4, we targeted modest Semi Systems revenue growth. We also widened our overall guidance range due to our concerns about the supply chain.  
 Toward the end of Q4, we experienced later-than-expected deliveries of the components we need to complete and ship our build plan by the end of the quarter. The reason for the delays is that our suppliers couldn't get enough parts from their own suppliers, which include chip makers and distributors. The supply issues are directly related to the semiconductor shortage, particularly in logic, power and analog ICs.  
 Not all of our semi businesses were affected in Q4. Our process control, CMP, etch and packaging businesses beat our revenue targets. Yet our overall Semi Systems revenue was $293 million below the midpoint of our expectation. The full semiconductor revenue impact of the shortages during the quarter was well above $300 million.
 In Q1, we are guiding for sequential growth of around 3%. We have the internal capacity to easily ship several hundred million dollars more of semi equipment, but we are planning for only modest supply increases. Looking ahead, I believe WFE spending will be up again in calendar 2022 and will remain strong, particularly for foundry/logic, both at the leading edge and ICAPS notes. I also believe Applied's business will be higher in the first half of calendar 2022 than in the second half of calendar 2021, both in Semi Systems and AGS.  
 Next, since it's the end of our fiscal year, it's a good time to assess the progress we're making towards our 2024 financial model. In April, we outlined targets to grow our revenue, profitability and earnings in a variety of WFE scenarios, including a base case of $85 billion and a high case of $100 billion. With everything we're seeing in the industry today, our high scenario of $100 billion is increasingly likely. 
 One year into the long-term plan, we've made good progress, increasing revenue by 34%, non-GAAP gross margin by 240 basis points, non-GAAP operating margin by 540 basis points and non-GAAP EPS by 64%. We believe our Semi Systems group is well on track to its growth targets based on our strong product road maps and the deep customer engagements Gary described.  
 We believe AGS can exceed the growth implied in our model after growing by 21% this year alone. In fact, AGS had record backlog of over $4.33 billion at the end of the year. 72% of the Q4 backlog was subscription business with terms of 1 to 3 years, and 65% of new subscription bookings were multiyear. 
 While our focus is on recurring revenue, AGS also includes our 200-millimeter equipment business. Our 200-millimeter business has been growing along with the rest of the ICAPS market, approaching $650 million in WFE revenue in calendar 2021.  
 Turning to our profitability metrics. We expect to achieve our non-GAAP gross margin target of 48.5% once the near-term material and logistics cost headwinds subside. We also feel confident in our non-GAAP operating margin targets. The Semi Systems group increased its operating margin by 590 basis points this year, while AGS delivered record operating margin of 31% in Q4. A major focus for us is increasing the display group's margin to between 25% and 30%. And we plan to be in that range by the second half of 2022.  
 Another of our targets is to return 80% to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. In fiscal 2021, we generated a record $4.77 billion in free cash flow, and we returned 96% mainly through stock buybacks. We ended the year with over $5 billion remaining in buyback authorization. And given the strong demand outlook and our view of the intrinsic value of the company, we expect to continue to be aggressive with the program.  
 Now I'll share our Q1 business outlook. Given the supply chain challenges, we expect to modestly increase revenue to $6.16 billion, plus or minus $250 million, or up around 19% year-on-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be around $1.85, plus or minus $0.07, or up around 33% year-on-year.  
 Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $4.46 billion, up 25% year-over-year. We project AGS revenue of around $1.33 billion, up 15% year-over-year. We expect Display revenue to be around $350 million in Q1 and higher as we progress through the year. Applied's non-GAAP gross margin should decline to around 47.4%, primarily due to higher near-term cost headwinds. We plan to increase non-GAAP OpEx to $970 million, which is around 15.8% of revenue, below our long-term model target of 16%. Our guidance also assumes a 12% non-GAAP tax rate.  
 Finally, along with Gary, I'd like to thank all of our teams and partners for their hard work in a challenging environment. Now Mike, let's begin the Q&A. 
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions] Operator, let's please begin. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: Welcome back, Bob. I'm sure you're happy to be back from the golf course. So I guess a couple of part question on supply constraints. You talked about not being fully resolved in January. Do you expect it to be resolved in April? And how are customers reacting to the shortages? Are they waiting on a full suite of tools? Or are they taking whatever tools they can get? And then, I guess, lastly, considering the backlog that you highlighted and also that longest lead time ASML is essentially sold out for all of 2022, it certainly looks like your visibility extends now into 2023. Can you speak to that? 
Bob Halliday: Sure. Thanks for welcoming me back. A few things. One, supply chain; two, overall demand environment; and three, visibility, I guess. The first one, supply chain, we actually did pretty well managing this through about 11 months of the year and a week, and then it got a little worse at the end of the quarter. And that was our issue. So now we're all over this thing. 
 In the short term, managing the next quarters is about prioritization, project management and execution. So we have set up a cadence that every week, I'm going through all the detailed performance by week of how we're doing on receipts, shipments, shortages, individual supplier names. And Gary is going through it almost every day, okay? So we are escalating this thing. 
 So then you say, why do we think we're going to do better in Q1? So if you look at some of the public companies you know, they're up 3% to 5% on average, some of our suppliers. We believe that our allocation will be somewhat better than that. We also believe that we have internally allocated that effectively, and we are working with our suppliers' suppliers, who are our customers, to free up more demand. 
 Secondly, if you look at the early data, in the first 2 weeks of the quarter, receipts were up about 15% from the previous quarter. So I think we're going to be okay. If you look at the stuff that caused these problems, there's miscellaneous problems all over the place, but most of those are manageable. What hit us hard was this thousands, theoretically, of electronic components that our suppliers use in our products to us. There are about 100 that we're closely monitoring last quarter and 10 that gave us problems at the end of the quarter. These are particularly around PLCs. We are monitoring the top 10 suppliers of our products, and we are monitoring those 100, plus 200 other components. We want to make sure nothing goes bad. 
 So I feel pretty good that, number one, the demand is really good. The backlog is there. The orders are up every quarter. It looks strong next year. It doesn't feel or looks strong next year. I think supply chain is going to get better incrementally every quarter through the year. 
 In terms of -- visibility is great. In terms of a full suite of tools, we are -- customers are taking all the tools we can ship. And we're largely keeping them happy, but we want to not get the backlog too big. But I think we're going to make progress throughout the year. 
Gary Dickerson: C.J., this is Gary. I'll add a little bit more. I've met with all the CEOs of our top customers, leading technologies and ICAPS here in the last quarter. And what I would say, certainly, the supply situation is challenging, but really no change in terms of the customer demand for the products. And some of the tools that, again, as Bob said, it's not a broad-based issue. Some of these tools are the ones that are most enabling from Applied. And again, those -- nothing has changed relative to that demand. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: Bob, welcome back as well. It's great working with you again. My guess is you're going to get multiples of C.J.'s questions on the supply side. But I'm just kind of curious, Bob, to follow up, as the supply chain gets better, do you think by the April quarter, there's a big step function pickup to the $500 million, plus or minus, that you can't ship in sort of October and January? Or will it be a little bit more linear than that as supply comes online? 
 And then to your point earlier, Bob, about the backlog, just how do you safeguard against sort of a frothy backlog in this kind of environment? There are impressive numbers. But typically, when customers can't get what they want, they tend to order more than they need. So how are you safeguarding against that? 
Bob Halliday: So in terms of rate of recovery and confidence in the backlog and kind of the double booking question, I think, is the question. So in terms of rate of recovery, what we're modeling from discussions with suppliers and our suppliers' suppliers and our internal analysis, which we're doing the best we can to model this, and we believe it's accurate, we think Q1, the rate recovery, if you look at it, our Semi business is up a little over 3% equipment. And that's about what the industry is quarter-on-quarter. Our AGS business is a little bit lower because it's 14 weeks last year in Q1 as the Chinese holiday falls into Q1 this year. But if you look at rate of recovery, we think it goes up a little over 3% in Q1. We think the equipment business picks up a couple of points more every quarter and builds more momentum later in the year. 
 Now as we get more visibility, next quarter, I'll be more confident in those numbers. But that's the kind of acceleration we're picking up in shipments. We hope to do better. We might do better, but that's what we're modeling. 
John Pitzer: [ Double booking ]. 
Bob Halliday: Oh, [ double booking ]. I don't think that's a problem right now, double booking, John. If you look at breakout between memory and the foundry/logic, foundry/logic was 60% this year of the business. We actually think it's up next year. If you look at public statements from TSMC, Intel, another big foundry/logic manufacturers, they're talking about multiyear commitments to WFE spending and very strong businesses on their side. We look within the mix that foundry/logic increases as a percentage of the mix next year. We look at memory as being slightly up, a little bit more on NAND, a little bit down on DRAM. So we think that's muted and reasonable. And we don't see double booking then. We see China down a little bit next year. So I don't see the double booking thing right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. 
Stacy Rasgon: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the impact of the constraints on the services business. Because it's not just services, there is hardware and everything else. Is services actually being impacted by constraints? Would services be strong without them? And how do you think -- how do you see services -- the evolution of services going forward into next year as the -- you work to resolve the constraint issues? 
Bob Halliday: Yes. Our services business is doing great. This year, we're up 21%. We're ahead of plan to hit the 2024 model. I think we might have said on the call even that we need a compound rate of growth of 7% a year to hit that model. We think we'll exceed that, probably do double digits this year growth in service. 
 If you look at our service business, it's multiple components. It's a 200-millimeter tool business. There is a contract services where you sign up for services 1 to 3 years, including different types of service arrangements. And then it's kind of time and material stuff. 
 If you look at the service business, we think it's going to grow strongly this year in double -- strong double digits. And in fact, our customers are thanking our service guys for getting them on to parts service contracts in the past year or 2 because our customers are in good shape in terms of support and parts. So I think that the parts issues, supply chain issues are not really impacting our service business. 
 The other thing, which we'll point out, and Gary might give you more detail, if you look at the parts of the constraint, things like PLCs and stuff, which are components -- in components, those are not the parts that are high replacement service parts in the service supply chain. So I think we're in pretty good shape on the service business, and it's a great business for us. 
Stacy Rasgon: And Bob, how would you guide services in fiscal '22 as a percent? Low double digit? 
Bob Halliday: Yes, I think it's low double digits growth. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. 
Vivek Arya: Just a clarification. What do you expect Display to do overall in this fiscal '22? And then my question is, this year, we have seen your foundry customers raise their prices. Fabless customers, IDM, they are raising their prices. What about the equipment side? How much pricing power do you guys have, right, that can help mitigate some of these supply chain issues? Because you did mention kind of a hit on your gross margin. So as you start to see some of the supply situation recover, should we expect this combination of pricing and the supply side help you to cover gross margins quickly? Or will the gross margin recovery take time? 
Gary Dickerson: Vivek, this is Gary. Thanks for the question. There's 2 parts to this. I'll take the first part, and then Bob can take the second part. Relative to Display, we've talked about that many times, really good adjacent market where we can take our semi deposition and e-beam technologies into a market with larger substrates. 
 For '21, as expected, we're on track for a little over $1.6 billion in revenue and maintaining strong share of our served market. We think '22 is a little higher than '21, more second half versus first half. And as Bob also discussed in the prepared remarks, we're on track to achieve our target for higher profit and free cash flow in the 25% to 30% range exiting 2022. 
 And then Bob, you have the second part. 
Bob Halliday: In terms of -- your second question is kind of a broader gross margin question. So if you look at gross margins this past year, we're up 2.4 points, which is great performance. We're on track to hit the model, which is, I think, about 48.5% in the out years. We're a little soft right now in Q1, and that's all supply chain stuff. As we go out through the year, we expect gross margins to rise up again as we get the supply chain issues behind us. 
 In terms of the things that impact gross margin, we did a lot of good things in 2021. We had very good cost reduction. We had high-value products and services. We sold to the customers, and we recognize that value back from the customers. And then we have pretty good volume and mix, which helped, too. 
 If you look at prospectively, the cost reduction is a little slower. We will continue to realize high value with the customers. We share that value, and we think that's going to help our margins. And if the cost continue, we may even have that discussion at some point. 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. So margin's kind of flattish in the first half and then maybe a little better in the second half if we keep the supply chain. 
Bob Halliday: Yes, I think so. And I think the year is a little better than this share overall by the time we're done. 
Gary Dickerson: Okay. Any comments on pricing? I think Vivek was kind of... 
Bob Halliday: Yes, we look to share value with customers, and I think that's worked for both of us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. 
Toshiya Hari: Bob, welcome back. Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about localization of semiconductor capacity going forward. Obviously, there's a lot of talks in the United States and Europe, in Asia as well, more recently, Japan. How are you thinking about the potential impact from all these projects? I think from a timing perspective, most of us are thinking 2023 or even later. But based on what you know, all the discussions you're having, how are you thinking about that? And sort of related to that, how should we think about the competitive threat from the local Chinese semi-cap companies? I know they've been around for a very long time. And up until this point, there remains a very significant gap between incumbents like yourselves and them. But how concerned should we be as we think about your business over the next 3 to 5 years? 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the questions, Toshiya. Relative to localization of supply chains and things like the CHIPS Act, that's obviously good for our business. We're in discussions. As I mentioned earlier, I've met with all of the top CEOs here in the last quarter. And that's -- as they move to these other new locations, that creates an opportunity for us to support them, especially with our services business. So we're in very close cooperation with those customers as they move forward with those plans. And there's opportunities. 
 I think for them, they're also concerned about cost and cultural differences and all of those things. And so that creates a tremendous opportunity, not just for our traditional services, but opportunities like AI(x), Applied Actionable Insight Acceleration, where I think they're also extremely focused on how to accelerate R&D ramp and optimize high-volume manufacturing in new locations. So I think that really creates a tremendous opportunity for us. 
 The other part of the CHIPS Act is really how every government runs faster in innovation and commercialization. And we're also in deep discussions with a number of leading technology companies. And that will also create an opportunity, I believe, for Applied. 
 Relative to the China equipment suppliers, really, if you look at what every single customer is focused on, it's providing power, performance and costs ahead of others. We talk about PPACt, and the T is incredibly important. And whether it's -- we talk about low-resistance wiring, which is probably one of the biggest issues in the industry where we have tremendous strength, or gate all around transistors or the scaling in memory or packaging, that is incredibly complex and difficult. And the companies that are ahead on power, performance and cost capture really the majority of the market. So I really believe that Applied is even in a stronger position going forward than we've been in the past relative to local competition. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Bob, welcome back. I just wanted to check on the fact that some of these constraints are pushing out revenues into next year, and it looks like maybe in the first half of next year, the WFE run rate could hit $100 billion. So I just wanted to figure out from your vantage point, how do you think about that? And you also mentioned that you're trending towards our target model, but obviously, the margins are impacted because of constraints. And the target model at $10 in EPS and $100 billion in WFE. How much discount should we give to that $10 in this constrained environment? 
Bob Halliday: Well, we think WFE is up next year. I think we probably said in the script it could be up -- I think at this time, we don't want to be too specific. We're talking to kind of 10% up next year. And I'd say pretty confident in that, frankly. 
 If you look at the run rate in the first half, the visibility is a little better in the first half. And we have very strong orders and booking potential in the first half. We actually think the second half is going to get a little stronger even on bookings than what we have today, frankly. Everything we've talked to customers is bullish, particularly in the foundry/logic area. 
 If you go look at the model, it's -- $100 billion, I think that's a real number nowadays. I don't know that it's a real number next year at this point. I think we achieved that $100 billion. We'll hit the model, and it was the model $10. I think we'll do it. 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Maybe I can add, Krish, one more thing relative to 2022 and then going forward, backlog for us is very strong. Again, I've met with all of these leading customers, foundry/logic, memory, ICAPS. And as Bob mentioned earlier, if you look at what they're publicly talking about in terms of their investments over multiple years, it's very, very strong. And some of this, obviously, I can't share publicly, but I have very high confidence that the business is going to remain strong through '22. And right now, '23 also looks good for us. And certainly, again, if you just look at all the public statements from those customers, again, they're not planning on a short cycle. They're planning to be ready with capacity to capture the opportunities. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: And Bob, welcome back. So I guess I have a question on WFE share. Gary, you talked about that a lot. And optically, your share this year is flat in the 20.2% to 20.3% range. But obviously, that's not representative because you would have done $300 million more in October. So I'm kind of wondering if you can adjust January for us. So what would January have been in terms of SSG if you had the supply? Would you have -- would that $4.45 billion guidance would have been, say, $300 million higher? I'm just trying to adjust your share higher because obviously, this year, you gained a lot of share on an adjusted basis. 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Tim, thanks for the question. Certainly, Q1 would have been significantly higher. I think Bob gave some color on that. But certainly, demand is far higher than supply. When you take us -- and outperformed in '19. We outperformed in '20. We're definitely -- we're on track to outperform in '21. We also feel very good about '22 and going forward. But I don't know if I want to be more specific other than what the color that we've already given on the call, but definitely would have been significantly higher in Q1 and then going into 2022. 
 In terms of the different parts of our business, we've talked about wiring resistance in foundry/logic really is the biggest challenge for our customers. As they shrink these features, resistance goes up. And we gave some color on copper barrier seed tool with 7 different technologies that is worth billions of dollars. And what I said in the prepared remarks is that we have 5 of these innovations that we're delivering to customers, and we haven't quantified all of them, but it's very sizable in areas where Applied is really unique in enabling the solutions to wiring resistance. In the one case, we've talked about 50% improvement in resistance. 
 And then you look at gate-all-around, again, we feel very good about our position in the transistor to gain share. That's $1 billion opportunity. And relative to our FinFET position, we believe we're positioned to gain share as that goes forward. Certainly, in foundry/logic, our etch share is increasing. Our EUV etch share is increasing. Our PDC share, we've talked about our business being up more than 60% overall. And just, again, really very, very strong position with integrated solutions. I gave some color on co-optimization and gave an example in the memory market where, again, we have a big opportunity. So Tim, I feel really good about our position going forward. 
Michael Sullivan: Yes. And Tim, I add one more thing for you. So I know in the past, instead of waiting for Gartner group to come out with market share, what you always did is you took our fiscal Q2 through fiscal Q1 as a proxy for our revenue. And what's interesting is what we did back in February, we kind of disclosed in our conference call. And then in April, I wrote everybody that we've made a similar adjustment ourselves. So what we're now doing is our calendar year revenue for VLSI share purposes, it's now based on our financial reporting in fiscal Q2 through fiscal Q1. And one benefit of that change is that as soon as we guide Q1, which we just did today, now you can forecast our WFE revenue for share purposes, and you can make an apples-to-apples with the peer group. 
 And then I just wanted to call your attention to one other number in the script today. Bob sized our AGS 200-millimeter revenue at around $650 million for the calendar year. So now you have all of the numbers that you need to make a share assumption. So I just wanted to give you that background. And we look forward, Bob and I, to seeing the investors at your conference. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: Bob, welcome back to the team. On the chip shortages, you talked about some of the areas, which have not been impacted as much, process control, CMP, etch, packaging systems, but that leaves things like deposition implant, thermal processes and many other areas. And I'm sure even within that, it's different for different systems architectures like leading edge versus ICAPS. So I'm trying to figure out what's the implication of -- which of your end markets are getting more impacted given that there are different etch deposition, pattern intensities -- patterning intensities and system configurations? Is foundry and logic getting more impacted? Is it memory that's getting more impacted? Is it ICAPS? Or is it across all of your customer segments? And also is your Display business being impacted as well? 
Gary Dickerson: So Harlan, this is Gary. First off, I would say that Display is not being impacted. Relative to the different device types, I don't know that I would separate one versus the other relative to the impact. Just as an example, in the foundry/logic business, ICAPS in Varian, our business in ICAPS, our share is up significantly in our implant market, and our revenue is up 4x over the last 2 years. So again, I think that when you look across the different products, there are specific components. It's not broad-based. But again, I wouldn't necessarily say that it's one market or another when you look at the impact. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: I wanted to double-click on your expectations for first half calendar 2022 being above second half '21. Does that apply to memory as well? Or should we think about that growth being mostly foundry/logic-driven and maybe memory is more second half-weighted? 
Bob Halliday: Yes. So if you look at our 2021 data in terms of memory versus logic, we were a little stronger in the first half on memory. And then if you look at -- I'm going to look at the actual data. So our foundry was a little stronger in the second half, and our memory NAND was a little strong in the first half, DRAM a little strong in the second half, actually. 
 If you look at next year, we think the year is kind of flattish. We think it's probably a little more second half weighted in memory next year. I think foundry is pretty strong throughout the year, but I don't think there's a big delta. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Yes. So overall, WFE... 
Bob Halliday: I think overall, WFE is up. I think foundry is a bigger percentage. I think memory is kind of flattish, ends up a little bit. DRAM is down a little bit. I think the split within next year, my memory is a little better in the second half, but I'm not sure. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. 
Patrick Ho: And likewise, Bob, I guess one rodeo wasn't enough for you. So welcome back. Maybe just following up on the AGS side of things. Given the high utilization rates, the high demand for chips today, have you seen any incremental type of pickups in your services business just because your customers are trying to keep their tools running as best as possible? Are you seeing any incremental pickup in subscription businesses just because of the current environment? 
Bob Halliday: Yes. I think the answer is yes. I'm not sure if I covered it completely the call. I'll give you some data. You guys like data. If you look -- I want to look at sustainability of all this. So we looked at bookings, backlog, orders rates, stuff like that. The other thing I looked at was growth in wafer starts and tool utilization, right? So I'm not sure if we said it in the call, but tool utilization at the end of the calendar fiscal year was at an all-time high in the last 11 years I look back at across all device types. So that gave me confidence this thing is sustainable and looks pretty good and is good for our service business. 
 And then I also looked at growth in wafer starts. And growth in wafer starts, I think I said in the call, is about 40% foundry/logic and kind of about 20% memory since 2016, particularly strong in 300-millimeter wafer starts for foundry/logic. So then if you go with the question you asked, Patrick, we grew our service business 12% -- 21% last year. We're looking at about 12% this year. And if you look at high utilization, foundry/logic tools growing particularly well for us. We did pretty well in etch in previous years also. I see our service -- and we increased our contract and the life of our contracts from 1 to 3 years. The subscription revenue business, sustainability of the service business looks really good. 
Gary Dickerson: Patrick, this is Gary. Just one other comment. In the discussions I've had with all of the CEOs, one thing that was pointed out was that having these subscription agreements and forecasted parts management, they said we're profiling better than others because they have those parts there. So from a supply standpoint, they said that was a big differentiator and gives them more conviction to continue and expand that type of approach. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. 
Quinn Bolton: I just wanted to ask about your outlook for China next year. In 2022, you said it would be down slightly. Wondering if you could give us a little bit more color what's driving that decline. Is it just digestion of capacity put in place this year? Do you see any political or export control impact or perhaps a trend towards supplier localization in China next year? 
Bob Halliday: Let me give some -- you guys are good data guys, and I'll give you some data. So 3 things in China. It's down some next year but pretty strong. 
 The second thing is if you look at trend and local versus -- spending by local companies versus international companies, it's trending up. It was high 70s, kind of 77% this year, about 82% next year. 
 The third is mix and business. So they've trended like the rest of the world to go a little bit more foundry/logic. So they were like 52% -- 48% memory this year, going to  like 52% next year. So they're trending that way. In terms of where it's down, I think DRAM is down a little bit in China next year and foundry. But the mix to foundry is trending up. 
Operator: Our last question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. 
Sidney Ho: I have a question on the process control side. You guys talked about process control was not an area that was impacted by supply constraints, and now growing about 80 -- 60% for this year. You guys also talked about a number of AI(x) engagements potentially tripling next year instead of doubling. Just can you help us understand how these engagements impact your revenue growth potential? Do they generally translate into revenue in the same year or a number of years? Do they increase the overall size of the market or just an opportunity for Applied to gain shares? And generally, just how you measure success with those engagements? 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. This is Gary. Thanks for the question. So the fastest-growing largest part of our PDC business is our e-beam product family, and we have tremendous leadership there. We're growing share a significant amount. The strength is really on our resolution and speed of imaging. And we're expanding that gap with coal field emission where we have about a 50% resolution advantage versus others. 
 And so when you think about the -- certainly, the growth there -- and we have line of sight to really good growth also in 2022. This co-optimization with e-beam is very, very important. We talked about that, an example, for capacitor scaling where we're combining a new material we call Draco, with innovative etch technology. And basically, optimizing these process is incredibly complex. You're trying to optimize many, many different parameters at the same time. And the goal is to optimize those recipes as fast as possible with big process windows because that directly impacts yield. So this combination with e-beam is incredibly important. 
 When you think about, again, capacitor scaling or gate-all-around or any of these big inflections, the ability to map that out and look at those fingerprints across the chip, you look at pattern loading for isolated dense structures, fingerprints across the wafer, being able to map out this multi-dimension space, and with the unique imaging of those features, which we have with our e-beam system, and then we talked about the Applied process recipe optimization, AppliedPRO within AI(x), it's really an enormous focus for all of our different customers. 
 So it certainly is growing our PDC business, but even more impactful, the opportunity for us to capture value with our IMS platforms, our co-optimized platforms is worth billions of dollars. So that is an accelerator for us that we're -- that gives us a tailwind, whether it's low R, gate-all-around, memory scaling, all of those different capabilities. And that's a great leading indicator going from 25 engagements to 75 next year. It does translate into wins in terms of these big inflections, accelerating the inflections. The T of the PPACt is worth an enormous amount for our customers. So it's really -- it's tremendously synergistic with our overall strategy and opportunity. 
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Sidney. And Bob, would you like to help us close the call with some summary thoughts and... 
Bob Halliday: All right. I have some summary thoughts. But first, I'm going to go off script and just say it's great to be back. We have a good team, included Gary. And when I visualize coming back, I thought of myself a little bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator. I'll be back. And then unfortunately, everyone hears [indiscernible] Welcome Back, Kotter, but I'm back anyway. 
 So let's do the 3-legged stool. Our markets are in strong and in great shape. We think WFE is up next year and, frankly, positively biased until '23. 
 Second, Applied's position is strong. Our spending -- our demand is great. Our orders are great. Our backlog is great. The mix of the demand is really favorable for us, including foundry/logic, these advanced devices, ICAPS. It's really great. 
 Number three is our financial performance and capital returns. I have to admit, I was impressed that the gross margins went up 240 points this year, and we were up 540 points or 5.4% operating margins. And last year, we returned 96% of free cash flow to investors, and we're looking at a really strong cash flow this year. So I think the company is just in fundamentally great shape. 
 We have supply chain headwinds. We take full accountability for making it work and delivering to customers. We are all over this issue. And next quarter or so, we're going to make a lot of progress. But fundamentally, this company is in great shape, and I'm looking forward to working with all of you again. 
Michael Sullivan: All right. Thanks, Bob. We'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. And Gary and I look forward to seeing many of you at the Credit Suisse Conference in Scottsdale in just a little while. And so happy Thanksgiving, and thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-08-19 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterward, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining Applied's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson (ph), our President and CEO, and Dan Durn (ph), our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures.  Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have some calendar announcements. On the 8th of September at 9:00 A.M. Pacific Time, we plan to host the third event in our Master Class series, this time focusing on the ICAPS markets and also on heterogeneous design and advanced packaging. Then, on the 18th of October, also at 9:00 AM Pacific Time, we plan to hold our fourth Master Class. We'll focus on process control and process optimization, including AIx platform technologies like e-beam and AI. We hope you'll join us. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. In our third quarter of 2021, Applied Materials, again, delivered record performance, capitalizing on strong, broad-based demand for our semiconductor products and services, while navigating a challenging supply environment. Over the past 18 months, the pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation of the economy and the adoption of advanced technology, creating a permanent structural shift for the industry. At the same time, COVID-19 has disrupted global supply chains in logistics. A transitory challenge will continue navigating over the coming quarters.  Across the Company I want to thank our teams for doing an incredible job to successfully overcome these near-term disruptions, provide outstanding support to customers and keep our R&D roadmap on track. In today's call, I'll focus on 3 main topics. First, I'll provide our perspective on the market, starting with our near-term outlook and then recapping our longer-term thesis. Second, I'll summarize the 3 pillars of Applied's growth strategy and third, I will explain how Applied is outperforming our markets today and is well-positioned to play an even bigger, broader, and more valuable role in the future.  I'll begin with our near-term outlook. Overall, there are no significant changes to our view of the market. Demand is strong and sustainable with customers making strategic investments to address long-term circular trends. In 2021, FoundryLogic is the fastest-growing wafer fab equipment market, and we believe it will represent more than 55% of total customer investment for the year. This spending is split relatively evenly between the leading edge, the 3 most advanced nodes in foundry and logic, and in technologies for IoT, communications, automotive, power electronics, and sensor applications, or what we call ICAPS. We expect DRAM spending to be the second-fastest-growing WFE market this year, and we see a positive setup for sustained investment in capacity and new technology.  Supply-side inventories remained below normal levels and long-term demand drivers are strong, fueled by memory-intensive AI computing. On an absolute basis, we expect NAND investments to be similar to DRAM for the year. We believe NAND inventories are at normal levels, both on the supply side and demand side. Looking further ahead, I strongly believe there has never been a more exciting time for semiconductor companies. We're only at the beginning of decade-long trends that will underpin secular industry growth. As I've said before, digital transformation is built on silicon and broadens the drivers for semiconductor innovation.  Demand for semiconductors is no longer about 1 or 2 killer applications, but rather an expansive structural shift in the economy towards digitization and automation. Smart and connected devices at the edge, not only consume more silicon, they are driving exponential growth in machine-generated data. To make sense and create value from the vast volumes of data available, new AI computing approaches are needed fueling further demand for current and next-generation semiconductors. While global consumption of silicon is accelerating, adoption rates of new technology vary considerably by region. As we showed in our investor meeting, we estimate that by 2025, China will have only reached the same levels of silicon spend per capita the U.S. saw in 2015.  And India trails China by another 8 to 10 years. Since the impact of digital transformation is so wide-reaching, national governments are increasingly recognizing the strategic importance of semiconductors. As government incentives become available in the U.S., Asia, and Europe, they can provide multi-year support as the industry moves from lean and just in time supply chains to more resilient, flexible, and secure approaches, including regionally distributed capacity. However, putting the right manufacturing infrastructure in place is only one piece of the puzzle. Investment in innovation infrastructure to lead in the development and commercialization of next-generation technologies is even more critical to winning the future.  Early access to superior semiconductor technologies, or what I refer to as winning the PPACt race will determine the countries and companies that thrive, and those that won't. At Applied, we have a strong point of view that the industry's future will not be like the past. And we've aligned our strategy and investments accordingly. Our strategy has 3 pillars. First and foremost, we are focused on being the PPACt enablement Company to provide the foundation for customers' power, performance, area, cost, and time to market roadmaps. We have the broadest and most enabling portfolio of process technologies that we can co-optimize and combine in unique and highly enabling ways.  Second, we're shifting more of our business to subscriptions, as we believe this model provides significant benefits to customers and for us. We have already converted a meaningful portion of our installed base business to recurring revenues and we are starting to monetize new products and services using subscription approaches. And third, we continue to optimize our portfolio of businesses that serve adjacent markets, including display, to drive profitable growth in higher free cash flows. This strategy is yielding results, and 2021, is shaping up to be a strong year of out-performance for Applied. Starting with our unit process tools, we are seeing a very strong demand for our leadership products.  For example, taking the midpoint of our fourth-quarter guidance, both our Epi and thermal businesses are on track to grow more than 70% this fiscal year. While CMP will grow more than 60% and implant more than 50%. We're also seeing our performance in our growth areas, especially process diagnostics and control, while we expect to grow more than 60% in calendar 2021. On top of this, we have strong momentum with our co-optimized and integrated solutions. By revenue, about 70% of the semiconductor products we sell today have already been co-optimized at some level. Co-optimization allows us to see and solve higher-value problems for customers, speed up technology transition to high-volume manufacturing, and make our solutions stickier.  Beyond co-optimization, our Integrated Material Solutions called the IMS, combine multiple processes with customized metrology and sensors in a single system, typically under vacuum. Our latest IMS product that lowers the interconnect resistance by 50% in advanced FoundryLogic directly addresses a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the next 5 years. With IMS, we can target the most complex and valuable challenges in the new PPACt playbook, and we have an exciting pipeline of new solutions, for both FoundryLogic and M. Another area we're seeing strong and sustainable growth, is our ICAPS business, which serves a broad spectrum of customers and applications in IoT, communications, automotive, power, and sensors.  Within ICAPS, demand for 28-nanometer and larger nodes is especially robust. Revenue from products serving these applications is expected to double this year. By acting early and forming a dedicated ICAPS team in 2019, we've been able to increase our focus on these customers and accelerate our share of this market. We're developing new products specifically designed for ICAPS markets, including integrated and co-optimized solutions. As a result, we're deepening our partnership and collaborations with these customers. For example, we recently signed a 5-year contract with a leading ICAPS customer designed to provide more assured supply for them and more predictable revenues for Applied.  Today, we are demonstrating strong momentum in our leadership and growth businesses, IMS and ICAPS. And as I look ahead, I'm confident our opportunities are even better. It's clear that advances in materials engineering are foundational to the industry's PPACt roadmap. The PPACt playbook has 5 key elements, new architectures, including workload-specific ICAPS and new memories, 3D structures, including gate all-around transistors, varied Power Rail and 3D DRAM, new materials for gate contact and interconnects, new geometric shrink, and advanced packaging. We believe that the relative contribution of these 5 elements to PPACt at future nodes is evolving in ways that create opportunities for Applied to play an even larger and more valuable role. Let's take advanced packaging as an example.  We identified this inflection early and began investing in differentiated technology years ago. Today, we enjoy a clear leadership position in advanced packaging equipment with more than 60% share of our served market. We will generate more than $800 million of revenue from our equipment business this year. And through a combination of organic R&D and strategic partnerships, we're also developing highly enabling future technologies. We are very excited about our opportunities and pipeline, and we'll share more details with you at our upcoming Packaging Master Class. Finally, when we talk to customers about PPACt, they consistently highlight the importance of t, time to market.  Time to market acceleration is a critical component of our PPACt enablement strategy. We've developed a proprietary suite of solutions to accelerate every stage of the product life cycle from R&D to technology transfer and high-volume manufacturing. Our actionable insight accelerator or AIx platform that we officially launched in May, brings together process tools, sensors, metrology, data analytics, and machine learning. We have strong momentum and are adding new installations at multiple leading customers. For example, Applied Pro is our process recipe optimizer within IX and is used to accelerate R&D qualification of individual chambers and tools, as well as enable larger process windows and higher chip yields.  Over the next 12 months, we expect to double the number of Applied Pro customer engagements from around 25 this year to more than 50. Before I hand the call over to Dan (ph), I'll quickly summarize. We see strong and sustainable demand for our semiconductor business underpinned by a wide range of positive macro and technology drivers. While COVID-related supply chain disruptions persist, our teams are doing a great job working through these challenges.  We believe Applied Materials will outperform our markets again this year, thanks to our strong portfolio of differentiated unit process tools for above leading edge, in ICAPS markets, combined with accelerating adoption of our IMS and advanced packaging products. As we look ahead, we're confident that the strength of longer-term secular trends, will drive semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets structurally higher, and we believe Applied is in the best position to accelerate our customers, PPACt roadmaps, and grow significantly faster than our markets. Dan, over to you.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. Today I'll begin by summarizing Applied's overall performance in Q3. Then I will discuss our semi-systems results, including new details about our FoundryLogic business. I'll also give you a number of metrics surrounding the large recurring revenue portion of Applied's Global Services segment. Then I'll add my perspective on the demand trends in our markets. And provide our guidance for Q4. Beginning with our Q3 performance, Applied generated the strongest revenue in Company history, with each of the segments exceeding guidance. We increased the gross margin to 48%, which is the highest in 14 years despite the ongoing cost headwinds related to COVID.  We also delivered the Company's highest-ever operating profit, operating margin, and earnings per share. Our results included record operating cash flow and record free cash flow of $1.5 billion. In fact, we've generated nearly 5 billion in cumulative free cash flow over the past 4 quarters. At the investor meeting in April, we made a long-term commitment to return 80% to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. And in Q3, the buyback window was available to us for the full quarter. We repurchased $1.5 billion of Applied stock during the quarter and returned 111% of free cash flow to shareholders, including dividends. We ended the quarter with around $6.5 billion remaining in our share buyback authorization.  Given the secular growth trends in our end markets and our view of the intrinsic value of the Company, we expect to continue to be active in the market for our shares. Finally, last quarter, I mentioned that Moody upgraded Applied's credit rating to A2. I'm pleased that earlier this month, Standard and Poor also upgraded our rating from A - to A. Now I'll provide some insights into the strong performance of our semi systems business which generated its highest-ever revenue in Q3. Our demand is broad-based across foundry-logic and Memory, and within foundry-logic across a wide variety of nodes.  We're increasing our technology leadership in many areas, and that's being reflected in our operating margin, which crossed 40% for the first time. About half of our FoundryLogic revenue is being generated by our ICAPS business, which focuses on all but the 3 most leading nodes. Our ICAPS business has a large global presence and serves a very large number of customers throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Many of the ICAPS applications have long product cycles, which generates lasting opportunities for us, both in equipment and services.  We have a high share, and the margins are accretive to the Company. We look forward to giving you more insights into the ICAPS markets and our strategies at the Master Class next month. Turning to Applied Global Services. We're building a solutions-based recurring revenue business that delivers predictable free cash flow across market cycles. Our segment reporting gives you good insights into the business. And I'll continue to help you with key performance indicators that demonstrate the unique qualities of the Applied services business, and the progress of our strategies.  From a segment reporting, you know that AGS delivered record revenue of $1.29 billion in Q3, up 24% year-over-year. 87% of AGS revenue was recurring services, parts, and software. The remaining amount was primarily legacy, 200-millimeter equipment. So Applied generated $1.1 billion in recurring revenue this quarter. This is by far the highest among our process peers and demonstrates our progress in generating lifetime value from the industry's largest installed base. Today, our semi-install base is just over 40,000 systems, and we have over 160,000 chambers in the field. At the investor meeting, we shared our goal to increase revenue per system by 20% between 2020 and 2024.  As of Q3, we're already halfway to achieving our goal. Now I'll put some metrics to our strategies for adding customer value to further grow our recurring revenue. Connecting the installed base to our AIx servers enables us to perform data-enabled services for our customers. Today, we have just over 4,300 connected tools, which is up over 30% from our 2020 baseline. We're also growing the number of secure remote connections, which allows us to connect our best experts to the installed base to perform remote analytics, diagnostics, and optimization from anywhere in the world. The number of remotely connected tools now exceeds 3,200, which is up over 36% from our 2020 baseline.  Another key focus is transitioning our recurring revenue to subscriptions in the form of long-term service agreements. Today, we're generating 60% of our recurring revenue from subscriptions, and our goal is to reach around 70% by 2024. We also have a subscription renewal rate of around 90%. Another sign of customer value is the tenure of the agreements across the entire base of subscription agreements. We've increased the tenure from 1.9 years at the end of 2020, to 2.2 years today. In fact, of our subscriptions booked in Q3, 77% were multi-year agreements.  We track all of these KPIs very closely. I hope they give you a good sense of the size and growth of our recurring revenue, and the strong customer pool we're generating by focusing on customer time to market, as well as cost output [Indiscernible]. Finally, another key metric we disclosed is the AGS segment operating margin, which provides a good indicator of the value our services bring to customers in Q3 across 30% for the first time in 15 years. Next, I'll add my perspective on the demand environment. While Q3 was a record quarter, we see further growth ahead.  In fact, our overall backlog is close to $10 billion with record levels in both semi systems and AGS and strength across all of our geographies. I still expect equipment spending to be higher in the second half of calendar 2021 for both FoundryLogic and DRAM. I expect WFE to be up in 2022 and I expect all of our reporting segments to be higher. Now I'll share our Q4 business outlook. We expect to increase Company revenue to approximately $6.325 billion, plus or minus 250 million or up around 35% year-on-year. We've widened the revenue range of this quarter because of near-term risks within our supply chain.  We expect non-GAAP EPS to be around $1.94 plus or minus $0.07 or up around 55% year-on-year. Within this outlook, we project semiconductor systems revenue of about $4.60 billion, up around 50% year-over-year. An AGS revenue of about $1.30 billion, up nearly 18% year-over-year. We expect display revenue to be around $400 million. Applied non - GAAP gross margin should be flat sequentially at 48%, or up around 230 basis points year-over-year. We plan to increase non - GAAP open to $960 million, which is around 15.2% of revenue and below our longer-term target of 16%.  Our guidance assumes a slightly higher non - GAAP tax rate of around 12.5%. In summary, I'm pleased that Applied delivered another record quarter of financial performance in Q3 with strong margins and free cash flow. The demand environment continues to be strong, and I'd like to join Gary (ph) in thanking all of our teams and partners for their hard work in a robust and challenging environment. Now Mike (ph), let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan (ph). To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have a second question, please just re-queue and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Was hoping to dig a little bit deeper into your ICAP business. You talked about FoundryLogic being 55 plus percent of the mix this year in ICAP, perhaps half of that.  Did I hear that correctly? And as you think about the spending there, can you -- can you walk a little bit more detail around leadership versus growth penetration for you and how we should think about the sustainability of spending there into 2022, as well as the positive mix shift to gross margins. And then finally, as part of that, is there a subscription angle that's a greater part of the story there, given lagging edge, or no? Thanks so much.
Dan Durn: Hi C.J., this is Dan (ph.). I'll start and Gary (ph.) can jump in with some perspectives after I'm done. So, as we think about the ICAPS market and the setup around FoundryLogic, I think the contours you drew create the right perspective greater than 55% of WFE this year is FoundryLogic.  When we look into FoundryLogic and look at the leading edge versus ICAPS nodes, we're seeing the balance in those 2 markets. We had balance in those 2 markets in 2020, we've got balance again in 2021. So, we're really encouraged by the strength we're seeing across the entire [Indiscernible] profile and geometries within FoundryLogic.  We think we're incredibly well-positioned on the leading edge to drive key enabling technologies as the new playbook rolls out. We're equally well-suited in the ICAPS nodes, to drive those roadmaps going forward. Innovation is back across the entire node profile. As our customers pursue unique opportunities in IoT communications, auto power sensors, there are very unique technologies and capabilities that need to be driven as intelligence finds its way to the edge.  Those road maps are vibrant. We've got key enabling technologies that are driving really good market positions for us at attractive margins. So, we think we're really well set up to perform extremely well, as both of these sides of FoundryLogic profile going forward in a very balanced way, so we like how well we're positioned.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. C.J. This is Gary (ph.). Thanks for the question. I think ICAPS, maybe some people would think is trailing technology nodes. But if you really think about the digitization of everything and this big inflection, People are talking about the future having 0.5 trillion or trillion connected devices at the edge, and certainly, as we talk to system companies that are deploying those eyes, and ears, and sensors, in all of those different applications that are transforming every industry, there needs to be a tremendous amount of innovation and power performance cost in both the chips and the packages.  So, we will cover this some more in the September 8th Master Class. But I would think about edge innovation. Certainly, in the cloud, you need high-performance to extract actionable insights. But that latency, power, cost, all of those things on the edge, that innovation is really important. And I think relative to sustainability, certainly, you can see the explosion of data, especially machine-generated data.  This market is very, very strong and we think as you go to a 1/2 trillion connected devices at the edge in the future, it's going to stay very strong. And as Dan talked about, we made a strategic change in our organization in 2019, pulling together key parts of our Company, 200-millimeter, 300-millimeter unit process innovation. We have some dynamite technologists focused on these markets. And again, we'll share more of that at our September 8th Master Class.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thank you, C.J... Operator, can we have the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I had a question on -- on memory, First on DRAM. So obviously it grew pretty nicely sequentially in the quarter. And it sounds like you're still pretty positive though on the trajectory and its still below prior peak levels.  And given the strength of your positioning and everything you've talked about, is there may be any reason to believe that like whenever we hit DRAM peak, whenever that is, is there any reason to believe that that level wherever it is, shouldn't be higher, potentially significantly higher than where we saw the prior peak, which was several years ago.  And I think on the other piece of Memory, NAND, you talked about FoundryLogic and DRAM, you didn't really mention NAND at all. I know last quarter your views on NAND were a little more muted than the rest of it. Have your views on the trajectory of that market into the back half down ticked at all, versus where you were 3 months ago because one of your competitors down ticked a little bit.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Stacy. Let me take a crack at those questions and if I leave anything out, please follow up to make sure I hit all of the points that you put on the table. First, I think our view around WFE this year, there's very little change. We said it's now over 80 billion, we think it's a mid-30% grower, plus, minus, and embedded within that, we see strength across all device types.  Your fastest-growing; FoundryLogic, second-half-weighted, next fastest-growing; DRAM, second-half-weighted. Still see strong demand and pull from customers there, so we feel good about that. Last quarter, we put a question mark on the profile of NAND. Is it flat? Is it down a bit? We needed a bit more time to tell, I think we're still in that category.  I think there's a question mark. Is it flattish? Is it down a bit? So very little has changed in terms of the shape of the profile throughout the year. Taking a step back and taking a look at our DRAM progress, this is a business that we've had strong momentum in now for several years.  And as we take a look at the road map, we talk about increasing our opportunity node over a node, and that seems to be playing out in the market. Right now, you are adopting logic-like structures within the DRAM market in this place to a traditional source of strength for us. And so, we're playing a key enabling role for our customers, and you see that playing out in the most recent results. And we would expect that strength to continue through the back half of the year.  As we look into 2022, we do see the overall WFE market up year-over-year. We see continued strength in all 3 device types; FoundryLogic, DRAM, NAND. And so, we like how well we're positioned against that opportunity. And the way we see it right now, we're planning for all 3 of our reporting segments to be up year-over-year.  The concept of the peak is a really interesting one in this context; if we take a step back and look at the secular trends shaping this industry, we know industries are going through a digital transformation, increasingly going to drive adoption of semiconductors, and I'd say the demand for semiconductors 5 years from now is going to be greater than it is today, and certainly greater than it was 5 years ago. So, all of that is playing out nicely. What I would also say in the DRAM market, that your node over node shrinks is producing less bit growth than they have historically.  So, you're seeing capital intensity rise in that market. You're seeing Capital intensity rise in all device types frankly. But when I look at the investments our customers are making in this environment, and I compare it on a historical basis as a percent of profitability to what we've seen historically. You go back about a decade and the customers are spending more from a WFE standpoint, the WFE, as a percent of EBITDA, is down 40% over the last decade.  So, the monetization of these investments is greater today than it's ever been. We really like the long-term secular drivers around our industry. And while every year may not be a peak, the trend line is definitely up and we do think it leads to higher highs and higher lows as this industry continues to drive its road map, and deliver the power performance road map. We think we're incredibly well set up to perform really well as those trends play out.
Stacy Rasgon: That's helpful. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Stacy(ph.).
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer (ph.) from Credit risk. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Gary (ph.), notwithstanding the comments you made in your prepared comments about how world governments have finally figured out how strategically important semi-production is. And we're going through a period of regionalization of semi-production.  If you look over the last 2 quarters, you've grown revenue over a billion dollars and the biggest chunk of that by far has been China. And so, I'm wondering if you can help us just better understand the makeup of spend in China today and to the extent that we're all expecting this regionalization of supply. When and how do you think that takes place?
Dan Durn: Yeah, thanks, John, let me take a crack at it. And so, what we would say is, we take a look at the business we do in China. We've got three reporting segments. The numbers we report are both semi systems to domestic China market participants, as well as the international market participants that are building facilities there.  All of the services that go into supporting those facilities, as well as the display equipment that we ship into the market. And so, there's a lot of moving pieces that produce revenue in China in any given quarter. As I take a step back and look at what's going on this year, and we compare it to maybe the $10 billion of domestic China spend in WFE last year.  What I would say is, is that you're seeing meaningful spending across all 3 device types, FoundryLogic, DRAM, NAND. I would say the waiting this year is towards the ICAPS market in China. And from a growth perspective, I would say it's probably growing a little bit above the overall industry average.  So, we feel really good about how while we're set up against this opportunity with longstanding relationships, key enabling technology, but we've got a broad and diverse business that serves this market across 3 reporting segments. And so, we feel good about how we're positioned and continue to drive strong performance as the market evolves.
Gary Dickerson: John, on the other part of your question, about when doing those investments happen from a regional perspective, there's no question. I'm involved in a number of different discussions. There's tremendous pull across many different regions: U.S., Europe, Asia. And what I would say is that certainly, it's important from a supply chain continuity to have more regional capacity, I think that's a big area of focus.  But personally, I think even more important is having not just physical infrastructure or manufacturing infrastructure, but innovation infrastructure. And if you think about the infrastructure that's going to enable this multi-trillion-dollar digital inflection. It really gets back to, as I talked about earlier, Edge innovation, Cloud innovation, everything in between, for power, performance, costs, ahead of others. So, as I -- we certainly see an opportunity, and that is moving forward relative to physical infrastructure and regionalizing capacity.  Also, certainly for Applied, the U.S, and many governments, having those foundational technology puzzle pieces for innovation to win this PPACt race of the future is incredibly important, and certainly Applied is in a position where we're going to continue to invest on top of what we've already done in the U.S with the Maydan Technology Center in Silicon Valley, the META Center in New York, but this is the race of our lifetimes and this innovation infrastructure I think is another key aspect of what needs to happen to win the future.
Dan Durn: And then very quickly John -- very quickly John, just from a timing perspective, an impact of the markets, we're not counting in anything from government spending in 2022. Our view is you start to see it in '23 and '24. If it happens faster than that, then it's upside to the perspective we have from a market standpoint. But '23, '24 is what we're currently seeing as the right timing around that spends to regionalize capacity.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thank you, guys.
Dan Durn: Hey, thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that you expected or you expect WFE to grow next year. I'm curious how much additional capacity are you planning to bring online next year? And as part of that, how does it impact your margin structure? Because when I look at your gross and EBITDA margins, they are pretty close, or in some cases have even exceeded your fiscal 24 targets. If you could give us some insight into how much additional capacity you are planning to bring online, and then where do margins go from here? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yeah. Thanks for that. If you noticed, we've been investing at a nice rate as a Company now for multiple quarters. You saw us begin to take that up, invest in our infrastructure. We took a point of view on where we saw this industry going -- was going, and we made sure that we had the capacity in place to serve our customers and make them successful.  We'll continue to do that along the way. We won't be point specific about how much capacity that we're bringing online, as you can imagine for competitive reasons. But we'll invest ahead of that materializing and continue to do what we've been doing now for several years as this industry continues to go structurally larger, and we put a capacity statement in place to support it.  From a margin standpoint, what I would say is the Company's performing really well in this environment. You see it in the current results. We told you it wasn't a one-quarter phenomenon and we see follow-through at these levels. And this is despite the near-term headwinds we see from a COVID environment.  And so, as those headwinds begin to dissipate, I think you see an upward bias off of these levels on a like-for-like basis from a margin standpoint. Then it also says, the long-term model that we put out [Indiscernible] talked about 48.5%. I think we're making good progress against that. It's a good way to think about the Company but no matter what our gross margin is, I would say we'll never be satisfied with it.  We'll be constantly looking for ways to increase the baseline level of productivity at the Company and do even better than we're doing today. So, we feel good about how we're set up. We'll continue to make investments to support the business, and we'll continue to drive results.
Vivek Arya: Thank you, Dan.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Vivek.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Gary, I wanted to ask about your leadership product. You gave some growth rates in your prepared remarks. I think for Epi and thermal you said above 70% growth this year, above 60% for CMP, and above 50% for an implant. All 3 outperforming, what I believe is, your full-year implied guide for semi systems.  I guess my first question is, what are some of the key drivers there? And my second part is, how should we think about sustainability into fiscal '22 based on what's in your backlog today and based on the conversations you're having with your customers? And I ask the question because it obviously has important implications for mix and gross margins. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Toshiya (ph.), thanks for the question. So, when I -- having constant conversations with R&D leaders many hours actually, in each of the last 2 weeks, and also CEOs for our leading customers. And what I would say when you think about the PPACt road map, Power, Performance, and Cost, and time, getting there ahead of others, that's what determines who wins and losses in the industry.  And when you think about the relative -- the key drivers for that, we've talked about 5 drivers, new chip architectures, new materials, new structures, new ways to shrink, and new ways to connect chips together.  If you look at what our customers are saying, even I think earlier today, but in many different forms, people are talking about new materials in the periodic table of elements, and packaging technologies, and new structures like gates all around, or design technology co-optimization with technologies like buried power rails, or contact over an active gate. And then some of those cases with no smaller pitch, you can drive significant area savings.  When I look at the road map, and I see this today in our leading businesses. And we also talked about, in our investor meeting, a new innovation where we could enable a 50% reduction in wiring with integrated material solution, where we're combining many technologies under vacuum; ALD, PVD, CVD, copper reflow, surface prep technologies, to drive a 50% reduction in wiring across many different levels. That is enormous when you think about power and performance.  And that one integrated system is worth billions of dollars. That's what we've communicated. So, Toshiya, I think that the opportunity for Applied has never been better. When you think about really the relative contribution of power, performance, and costs going forward, whether it's in the leading edge where you're processing all of that data in the cloud.  The edge innovation that I talked about earlier today, new Memory technologies, where it's really in the sweet spot for Applied for materials innovation, structure innovation, we have a very strong position in advanced packaging. We're driving innovations not only with our breadth in our unit processes but also in combinations with partners with new Integrated Material Solutions.  We're going to share more of that in our Master Class in September rate. So, I think the strength that you're seeing if I lookout for the next few years and I look at the relative contribution to PPACt, I just think we've never been in a better position, and our leadership areas, in the strategies and investments that we've been driving, are paying off now, they'll pay off even a bigger way going forward.
Toshiya Hari: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I have a question for Gary on the display industry. When should we expect an inflection on the display side? And how long we will go through this LCD to OLED conversion phase, and when should the new capacity come on for display?
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks Atif (ph.). Let me jump in on that one. So, we talked for several quarters now about strengthening fundamentals in the overall display market, capacity coming out, strengthening panel prices, screen sizes continued to increase. You see 5G OLED penetration in the handset. And then future roadmap foldable displays in the handset.  You talked about OLED penetration of larger format displays, IT TV, all of those strengthening market fundamentals, I think, give us a good sense that in 2022 you're probably going to enter a more attractive point of the investment cycle. I don't think it's going to be a dramatic step up off of these levels, but you'll certainly start to see better levels of investment. I think we're on the cusp of that right now, too early to tell exactly when it hits at the beginning of 22 -- in the back-half of 22.  But we're on the cusp of entering that more attractive point I think there are technical solutions that need to be solved in the OLED market to drive it into large format displays and start to replace LCD. So, I think that's a little way out. But we're certainly watching the customer's roadmap, the success with the technology, inflection, and then putting capacity behind that inflection.  Once that happens, I think you've got an opportunity to take this market structurally larger and it will be a long-term technical shift in the industry's road map on those large format displays. those solutions will be more capital intensive than LCD technologies today, and from an Applied Material and display business standpoint, it will be an attractive piece of business for us when it happens. But I still think we're a little way away from that inflection actually hitting the market and customers putting capital behind it.
Atif Malik: Thanks, Dan.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Atif.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Dan, I had a question about inventory. Your sales have grown the last few quarters on a sequential basis, yet your inventory dollars have stayed roughly around $4 billion give or take.  And with some of your component and subsystem suppliers being constrained due to a militia and other factors, are you pulling from hub Inventory? And are you worried at some point your suppliers' challenge could manifest into curtailing your own revenue potential down the road? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yeah. Thanks, Krish. So, what I would say is I think we all know that the supply chain is the global economy begins to fire back online. There are pockets, nonlinearity, and some disruption and certainly, our industry is no different on that front. I think what you see is a disciplined, efficient operation of the Company in a challenging environment. We feel good about how we're operating.  My expectation in the current quarter, given what we see going forward is as you would begin to see that inventory rise in anticipation of what we see on the horizon, but we'll take it 1 quarter at a time, make smart decisions about how we engage with our supply chain to make sure we're set up to successfully satisfy our customers' needs and make them successful. So, as I look back on the last several quarters, really comfortable and pleased with the way the Company is operating in the environment and growing the Company in a very disciplined way.
Krish Sankar: Thanks Dan (ph.).
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Krish (ph.).
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the solid results and execution. The team did very well in the $6 billion-plus control segment last year. I think your prior view was that you were going to grow this segment by 50% this year. And now the team is saying up 60% plus this calendar year. Clearly, sustaining the strong momentum from last year.  Obviously, we know there's a strong focus on new process debug and production yield improvements as time-to-market for these new processes is still critical. What areas is the team going to see the strongest growth or potential share gains this year and process control? And how do the growth prospects look for process control into next year?
Gary Dickerson: Hi, Harlan. Thanks for the question. When I think about our PDC business, there are really 2 aspects, 1 is certainly we're seeing tremendous growth within PDC. and certainly e-beam leadership, we're extending our e-beam leadership, I'll talk about that. We have the new optical product, the Enlite, we're expanding traction of that product. But the other aspect that's really important, is the synergy with those technologies and our unit in IMS innovations.  I talked about, in the prepared remarks, the Applied Pro process recipe optimization, extending that from 25 different engagements to more than 50 next year. And so basically what we're doing is taking our e-beam leadership, we have the highest resolution, and we can generate massive data with unique imaging and algorithms, so we can look at fingerprinting across a chip for things like pattern loading or across the wafer.  And really dialing those recipes in for our unit process and IMS innovations, whether it's wiring, or gate all around, or capacitors structures and DRAM, or any of those kinds of things, that's worth billions of dollars to us and it's worth a tremendous amount for every one of our customers. So that combination in the synergy is also very powerful. And relative to the revenue growth within PDC.  Again, that's been really great to see our e-beam portfolio of products is extremely strong. We're also deploying new technology and we will talk more about that at the upcoming Master Class to extend our leadership from a resolution perspective. Certainly, across all of our products, across EUV types of application. So that's very strong.  The optical part is also growing where we have real strength with some leading FoundryLogic customers across a broader set of customers. So, I'm very optimistic. Your question about sustainability, very, very optimistic, about the sustainability of revenue growth within PDC, And I'm even more excited about the synergy for R&D acceleration in big process windows and higher yield for the rest of the Applied portfolio.
Harlan Sur: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I just wanted to get both of your views on some of the longer-term puts and takes on the systems business. If we look at the commentary here into the back half of this calendar year, it seems like we're doing about $45 billion in WFE for the back half of the year, run rating of around 90 billion. And if you just take the cumulative street consensus for semiconductor revenue, it's in the 290-295 range.  So WFE intensity seems a bit above 15% here in the back half of the year. And I think you've said that you think 14% of the longer-term number. So, I guess my question is, how do you think about the puts and takes for where the systems business could go on the downside? Because as you say, Dan, that we do have subsidy-driven WFE coming on beginning in 2023. So, I guess I'm just wondering how you think about the puts and takes around all of that. Thanks.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Tim. When you think about run rates, and you think about market share, and you think about quarterly run rates. First of all, you're going to see things move from quarter to quarter, so it's hard to extrapolate what happens in any given quarter. with a broad trend. The second thing I'd say is, depending on what you assume from a market share standpoint, you can get some pretty big swings in the analysis.  From my perspective, we got a market that we think is over 80 billion this year, mid 30% grower. Our systems business in the first 2 quarters of actual results, 1 quarter of guide, those 3 quarters, our semi systems segment, is going to be up over 50% against that market opportunity.  We're seeing strength across all three device types and node over node momentum, we see our opportunity increasing. As we look into 2022, we see WFE up. Our confidence interval on that has gone up in the last 3 months. And so, we feel good about that perspective, then you see regionalization of capacity.  And so, hard to always call with precision the profile in any given year, as I take a step back and think about the importance of semiconductors to digital transformation verse -- virtually Agri segment of the economy, you think about raising capital intensity. I think there's an upward bias on capital intensity over time as a result of traditional 2D Moore's Law, traditional 2D shrinks hitting a wall, the new playbook that has multiple elements to it.  We're certainly going to play a key enabling role in each element of that new playbook. I see there is an upward bias of capital intensity over time, and I don't think it tops out at 14%, and then you think about regionalization of capacity to create a secure supply of semis. I think that provides an even further upward bias. And so -- and we've been on this observation for a while.  If you go back a decade and look at 2-year rolling averages of WFE, every year won't be up, but each successive 2-year window has been up to over the prior. And as we look forward over the next decade, we see those secular trends shaping our industry, showing nice signs of strength. You will get a cyclical low overlay on top of that trend line. It's going to lead the higher highs, higher lows, but it's hard to call with precision the timing of when those peaks and valleys hit.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you, Dan. Appreciate it.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Tim. And operator, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Joe Quatrochi: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the results as well. I'm just curious about the WFE outlook. You talked about increasing confidence in 2022. Can you give us any sort of update on how we think about it, I think the last part you talked about is over 160 for 2021, plus 2022? I think we're a little bit higher now for 2021?
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks, Joe (ph.). Here's what we see. So, we said over 160 for 2021 and 2022, we see 2021 being over 80 billion, and we see up year-over-year. So, we won't be point specific to update that over 160, but clearly, we've got a lot of confidence that you're pushing higher to those levels, higher than that level, if '21 is over 80 billion already, and you're up into 2022.  So, we feel good about the setup. And certainly, our opportunity given the momentum we outperformed in '19, we're going to outperform again in '20 and '21.  We think we're set up to continue that as we look into 2022, and we're planning for each of our reporting segments as we look into 2022, to be up. So, we feel good about how the Company is executing against that opportunity. But it probably won't update in a point-specific way the 2 years. But I think what I just shaped for you gives you a sense of what we see.
Joe Quatrochi: Fair enough. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Joe, and thanks for your question. Dan, would you like to help us close up today's call?
Dan Durn: Yeah. Thanks, Mike, sure. As I look at the most recent quarter, one big takeaway I take away from the quarter is just how much the FoundryLogic market has broadened. What used to be a leading node only spend in the past, is now evenly balanced between leading-edge and ICAPS markets today. I think that speaks to the momentum we see of edge computing IoT.  When you put intelligence at the edge, it sets up a virtuous cycle where the data generated at the edge is going to create more demand for advanced logic and memory in the cloud, it's a nice virtuous cycle. Another observation, despite the supply chain headwinds the industry is seeing, our teams are working incredibly hard in driving gross margin initiatives, and they're delivering some of the best results the Company has ever had.  I also like the strong free cash flow being generated, really sets us up well to deliver even more cash to shareholders over time. Hopefully, I'll see many of you at the Needham, Deutsche, and city conferences in the coming weeks. And so, with that, Mike, let's go ahead, close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Great. Thanks, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific time. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-05-20 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's second quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. We plan to host another Master Class this time on Logic technology on the June 16th at 9:00 AM Pacific Time. We hope you'll join us. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you, Mike. I'm pleased to report another record quarter for Applied Materials, underpinned by strong and broad-based demand across our semiconductor businesses as large secular trends fuel increasing consumption of silicon. I'd like to thank our passionate and hardworking team for delivering these great results and, in particular, I want to acknowledge our operations group and suppliers for successfully overcoming logistics and supply chain challenges in the quarter. At our recent Investor Meeting, we described our thesis for the industry, laid out our growth strategy and provided our new financial and capital allocation models. Therefore, in today's call, I will focus my comments on three main topics: how we see the current market environment, how Applied is outperforming our markets today, and how we're positioned to grow faster than our markets over the longer-term. Later in the call, Dan will talk about our subscription revenues, the strength in our service business and provide more color on our financial performance and outlook. I'll begin with the industry environment. As the world starts to transition to the post-pandemic economy, demand for semiconductors continues to grow. The pandemic accelerated key technology trends that make semiconductors more pervasive and indispensable in people's lives. Current capacity shortfalls in some areas of the market show the highly efficient just-in-time supply chains that have served the semiconductor industry well for the past two decades may not be the most effective strategy going forward. There is a clear desire for the chip industry to build more resilient and flexible supply, including more regionally distributed capacity as the strategic importance of the semiconductor supply chain is increasingly acknowledged at a national level. It's also important to recognize that we're still in the early innings of major secular trends that will play out over the next decade and drive the semiconductor and semi-equipment markets structurally higher. At the Investor Meeting, we described five overlapping inflections: first, at a macro level, digital transformation of the economy is rapidly advancing. For individuals, companies and nations, embracing digital transformation is nondiscretionary because it changes the basis of competition. Those who quickly and effectively embrace these new ways of working will emerge as winners and those who don't or can't adapt will not keep up. Digital transformation is driving exponential growth in data generation, which leads to the second major inflection, AI computing. New computing approaches are needed to create value from these massive volumes of data. AI computing works best with workload-specific software and hardware built from customized and entirely new types of silicon. Third, the benefits of traditional Moore's Law 2D scaling are slowing down and the semiconductor industry is transitioning to a new playbook to drive power, performance, area cost and time to market. As the PPACt playbook is adopted, it is driving a step up in investments across the ecosystem. Fourth, there is an increased focus on ensuring that growth is sustainable and responsible as the industry scales and advancing energy-efficient computing is critical. And fifth, there is a business model inflection as companies migrate away from products and transactions to outcomes and deeper collaborations focused on speed and time to market. These five factors add up to strong and strengthening demand for wafer fab equipment in advanced services that we believe is sustainable well beyond 2021. For the first time, customers are providing capital spending guidance for multiple years into the future, which is a new leading indicator for demand sustainability. In 2021, we expect foundry logic to be the fastest-growing wafer fab equipment market with strong investments in both leading edge and specialty devices. DRAM is the next fastest-growing market with all major DRAM manufacturers investing in new technology and capacity. Finally, we see NAND growing at a more modest rate this year on the back of about 30% growth in calendar 2020. More importantly, Applied is outperforming the overall market. Recent VLSI market data confirmed that our semi-equipment business grew 23% in 2020 versus market growth of less than 19%. We outperformed even though the device mix would not typically be considered favorable for Applied. There are several reasons why I'm confident 2021 will be another strong year of outperformance. To start with our leadership areas are in the fastest-growing parts of the market. We expect CMP epithermal implant to all grow more than 50% this year. Next, we're very well-positioned to serve the fast-growing specialty markets. We anticipated this market growth several years ago and formed a new group inside the company called ICAPS to focus on IoT, communications, automotive, power, and sensor applications. In addition, we have strong traction with new products, especially in areas where we have space to grow share. In 2020, we gained 240 basis points of market share in conductor etch and 220 basis points in CVD, thanks to the momentum we have in patterning applications for DRAM and foundry logic. This year, our etch and CVD businesses combined will generate more than $7.5 billion of revenue. In Process Diagnostics and Control, we expect to grow around 50% in 2021 and generate more than $900 million of revenue from our e-beam products. Extending our leadership in e-beam has been a major focus as it is a highly strategic capability that accelerates adoption of our differentiated semi products and integrated material solutions as well as being a key component of our actionable insight accelerator. Finally, we are seeing increasing adoption of our integrated solutions where we're bringing together unique combinations of technologies and capabilities. In 2021, we expect to generate more than $400 million of revenue from our first integrated material solutions. In addition, revenues from our advanced packaging product portfolio are on track to exceed $800 million, almost doubling since 2019. Looking beyond the strength in our business today, we believe we're in a great position to deliver sustainable outperformance over multiple years. As the industry roadmap transitions from traditional 2D Moore's Law scaling to the new PPACt playbook, materials engineering becomes critically enabling. This is because significant PPACt innovations in transistor and interconnect, structures and materials are taking place and these innovations are enabled by Applied's leadership technologies. We'll cover this topic in more detail at our upcoming logic masterclass. As we described at our Investor Meeting to serve our customer's evolving needs and maximize our growth opportunities, we've built a comprehensive strategy to position Applied as the PPACt enablement company, shift more of our business to subscription revenue and optimize our investments in synergistic adjacent markets to drive profitable growth and higher free cash flows. Our PPACt enablement strategy has three differentiated pillars; first, Applied has the broadest and most enabling portfolio of technologies spanning materials creation, modification, removal and analysis. At our recent Memory Master Class, we talked about how we're taking unique Applied technologies that were originally developed for Logic, including Black Diamond low-k materials and high-k metal gate transistors into the DRAM market, opening up new billion-dollar opportunities. Second, we can combine our technology portfolio in unique and highly enabling ways that no one else can do. A great example is our Draco hard mask material for capacitor scaling in DRAM. Draco has been co-optimized to work with Applied's etch system in a process development that we accelerated with our e-beam technology. Today, we offer a spectrum of solutions from co-optimization of processes and tools like Draco all the way to fully integrated material solutions that combine multiple processes and customized metrology and sensors within a single platform. The third pillar is time to market acceleration. We've developed a proprietary suite of solutions to accelerate every stage of the product life cycle from R&D to technology transfer and high-volume manufacturing. We call this the Actionable Insight Accelerator or AIx platform and it brings together process tools, sensors, metrology and analytics and machine learning capabilities. There is tremendous pull from customers and we already have AIx engagements with all major memory manufacturers. One example of how we're applying machine learning in real-world applications is ExtractAI that allows us to combine the most powerful attributes of optical and e-beam inspection and provide a solution that's many times faster than traditional approaches. In simple terms, optical inspection is fast and can find critical defects while e-beam is slower but has higher resolution to accurately classify those defects. So we use our e-beam system to train the ExtractAI engine for defect and noise classification. As Applied's e-beam technology has best-in-class resolution in imaging, we get the most accurate classification to train our AI models. We then use inferencing to turn an unclassified map of millions of potential defects into an actionable map of thousands of yield impacting defects. Before I hand the call over to Dan, let me quickly summarize. We see strong and sustainable demand in our semiconductor business underpinned by a wide range of macro and technology drivers. We believe that we're in a great position to outperform our markets again this year, thanks to our broad exposure to the major industry inflections, our strong portfolio of differentiated unit process products and accelerating adoption of our integrated material solutions and advanced packaging products. We feel very positive about the longer-term secular trends that are driving semiconductor and wafer fab equipment structurally higher and we're confident that we have the right strategy to accelerate PPACt and grow significantly faster than our markets. Dan, over to you.
Dan Durn: Thanks Gary. Today, I'll begin by summarizing Applied's performance in Q2 then I'll recap the latest third-party data on the semiconductor equipment and services markets. I'll build on Gary's comments about the equipment demand environment and then I'll give you an update on our plans to grow our subscription business and generate incremental free cash flow in synergistic adjacent markets. I'll finish with our guidance for Q3. Beginning with our Q2 performance, Applied delivered record revenue that was up 41% year-over-year and near the top of our guidance range. Our teams executed well delivering strong gross margins in a challenging operational environment and this led to record non-GAAP earnings that exceeded our guidance range. All three of our operating segments exceeded the revenue guidance and we continued to expect each to post higher revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. The semiconductor systems team also delivered the highest non-GAAP operating margins in nearly 14 years, while AGS delivered the highest margins in nearly 15 years. These accomplishments helped us generate record non-GAAP operating profit and increase non-GAAP operating margin by 700 basis points year-over-year. We increased operating cash flow by 87% year-over-year delivering over $1 billion for the third quarter in a row. We're pleased that Moody's recently upgraded Applied's credit rating by a notch to A2. We also resumed the buyback program in Q2 deploying $750 million in the limited window available to us and we expect to be more active in the current quarter. Also during the quarter, the Board approved a new $7.5 billion stock buyback authorization along with a 9% dividend increase, and we announced our commitment to return 80% to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. Next, since our last earnings call, VLSI Research published its market sizing report for calendar 2020, which is important for two reasons; one, it distinguishes front-end equipment spending from back-end assembly and test; two, it includes company services and spares revenue in addition to equipment revenue, allowing observers to distinguish between recurring revenue and WFE. Applied Materials was number one in both equipment and services for 2020. The equipment market was $61.2 billion, up nearly 19% year-on-year. We significantly outgrew the market gaining 60 basis points of industry market share with gains in deposition, removal and process control. As Gary described, major inflections are increasing the demand for materials engineering and we're on track to significantly outperform once again in 2021. Next, I'll discuss the demand environment. Last quarter, we indicated the equipment market would be in the low $70 billion in 2021, which was above the consensus at the time. Demand has strengthened further and we now expect equipment spending to be in the high $70 billion for the year. At the Investor Meeting, I showed you a chart with the rolling two-year sum of equipment spending, for each period since 2012 plus 2013, each successive two-year period has been higher, and I now believe that spending in 2021 plus 2022 will be greater than $160 billion. Our demand thesis for the past several years is that data generation is growing exponentially, while 2D scaling is slowing, which means more process equipment will be needed. Over the long history of the industry, equipment capital intensity has been close to 12% on average, but because of the higher technical complexity and the slowing of 2D scaling, capital intensity is closer to 14% today. Multiple industry forecasts call for the semiconductor industry revenue to reach $1 trillion by 2030. If capital intensity stays flat from here, then WFE spending could be over $140 billion in the same timeframe. I realize there are questions about whether the unprecedented demand we are seeing today is secular or cyclical. When I listen to what our customers say, I hear a firm belief that the data economy is real and driving secular growth well into the future. This perspective is being reinforced by plans for substantial multiyear capital investments which are needed to support demand and fuel profitable growth. Against this backdrop, we've never felt better about our opportunity to enable our customers, generate free cash flow and return cash to shareholders. Next, as we discussed at the Investor Meeting, we're also focused on growing beyond equipment sales. The more we deliver solutions and outcomes for our customers, the more we can increase our subscription revenues which grow and generate free cash flow every year. The report I mentioned earlier shows that over 90% of Applied's reported services business is composed of recurring services and parts revenue, which is the highest amongst our peers. We generated $3.7 billion of this true services revenue in 2020 with 60% in long-term agreements and renewal rates of around 90%. In Q2, the trend towards long-term subscriptions was even stronger, nearly 70% of our services in parts bookings were subscriptions and 50% had terms of at least three years. Our strategy in AGS, and as a company, is to combine our technologies in unique ways to create higher-value solutions and outcomes for our customers, which are best delivered under the subscription model. We also discussed our strategy to redeploy our technology in synergistic adjacent markets, where modest investments can generate attractive supplemental free cash flow. Today, the largest example of this strategy is our display business, where our CVD, PVD and e-beam technologies have been adapted to glass substrates. Over the past couple of years, we've strengthened our products for the next wave of OLED investments targeting foldable smartphones, notebooks, tablets and TVs. With these investments completed, our focus is on increasing free cash flow. We're committed to increasing non-GAAP operating margins from the high-teens level today to over 20% in the coming quarters and then between 25% and 30% over the target model horizon. Now I'll share our Q3 business outlook. We expect to increase company revenue to approximately $5.92 billion plus or minus $200 million. The midpoint would be up about 35% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $1.76 plus or minus $0.06 or up about 66% year-over-year. Within this outlook, we project semiconductor systems revenue of $4.25 billion, up around 46% year-over-year. And AGS revenue of about $1.23 billion, up around 19% year-over-year. We expect Display revenue of around $415 million. Applied's non-GAAP gross margin should be roughly flat sequentially at 47.7% or up around 270 basis points year-over-year. We plan to increase non-GAAP OpEx to $930 million. And as a percent of revenue, non-GAAP OpEx should decline by 290 basis points with nearly 70% of the spending earmarked for R&D. Our guidance assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of around 12%. In summary, I'm pleased that Applied delivered another record quarter of performance in Q2 with strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. And I'd like to join Gary in thanking our employees and supply chain partners for supporting our customers. Now Mike let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Dan. Now to help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today's call. If you have a second question please just requeue and we'll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions and congrats on the solid results. Gary, nice to see the uptick in your forecast for WFE for the year. I'm kind of curious when you look at your ability to supply customers or the ecosystems' ability to supply customers relative to the high $70 billion WFE, is there potential for upside this year? Or are you already starting to see kind of the backlog for next year fill-in just given some of the constraints and lead times on tools?
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks, John. This is Dan. I'll jump in on this one. So what we're seeing from our own business. We talked about it in the prepared comments, we see a market that's up strong from a year-over-year standpoint, high $70 billion probably puts us up high 20%, 27.8%, 29% versus where we were last year and that's off of a baseline of $61.2 billion. What I would say is, we're planning for our business to be up second half over first half and we're also planning for our business to be up as we look into 2022. And as I look at it by reporting segment, I would say, all three of our segments are up half over half and then all three of our segments are up as we look into 2022. So I can't comment for everybody. What I would say is, is we've been very aggressive in terms of managing this upward gradient of the industry. We started it several quarters ago, three, four quarters ago, you can see an uptick from an investment standpoint to make sure that we've got the infrastructure and capacity and capability. And that's not only investments from our physical infrastructure, but also working with our supply partners to make sure that we can fully satisfy all the demand that we see from our customers based on the great innovation that we're delivering to market. So we feel good about how we're positioned to outperform in this environment. And as we look forward into the back half of the year and 2022, we're planning for our business to be up.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Dan.
Operator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Just to clarify, want to make sure that you're talking about second half calendar 2021 versus first half calendar 2021 in terms of up half on half? And then for my main question, as I think about your operating margin for silicon at 39.1%, this was your best, for instance, I had to look back since I think June 2007. And so I guess, as we think about WFE moving higher from here into 2022 and likely beyond, how should we think about the trajectory there? And how important was mix in hitting the numbers that you put up in April and again how should we think about it going forward? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks, C.J. Let me jump in on this one again and you get a lot embedded in there and let me try to unpack it. And if I miss something, please follow up and let me know what else I can shed some color on. So the first part of the question, second half over first half, that's both fiscal year and calendar year, and again, we're planning on being up as we look into 2022. So we've got a market that's showing signs of strength. The first half of the calendar year, when you take a look at our actual results plus our guide, our systems business is up 50% year-over-year. So we feel good about how we're positioned against this opportunity to outperform and second half over first half being up both on a fiscal and calendar year basis. When I look at our silicon business and the performance of it, what I would say is, is as a company, gross margin for our company is up 310 basis points year-over-year. The company has got a lot of work on driving productivity gains, operating discipline, efficiency into the core of our operations. We're adopting digital capabilities inside the four walls of our company to make sure we are far more agile as a company to respond to upward and downward gradients. And there's more work to do, we'll never be satisfied with where we are, but we've got a whole host of initiatives at work to help this company become more efficient over time and you see that the profiling into the results of the company. As an overall company, you see our operating margin up 700 basis points year-over-year. From a semi system standpoint, the margins will always be influenced to a certain extent by customer mix, product mix, factory loadings. But I think you can see on both an absolute and relative basis, this is a company that's performing very, very strong right now and I would expect us to continue a trajectory of strong performance as they go forward. And so I guess, the last thing I would say, it all starts with innovation, your ability to drive economic value accretion for your investors starts with innovation. We've got the industry's broadest portfolio of industry-leading technologies. And at our Investor Meeting, we talked about combining them in unique ways to solve really high-value problems for our customers in a way that's incredibly valuable to their roadmaps, delivery of those roadmaps from a time perspective that they can make their customer successful. So we'll continue to drive the industry's best technology, we'll drive efficiency and operating discipline while we do that and we think we've got an opportunity to create significant value over time for our investors.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, C.J.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the DRAM business within the semiconductor system. So it's the only business of yours that hasn't really inflected, both foundry and flash were up pretty decently sequentially year-over-year, DRAM was kind of down both sequentially and year-over-year. And yet you're still looking for it to grow pretty materially through the year. So I guess and I know - we know supply in that market has been very tight. So I guess can you talk a little about the dynamics you're seeing in DRAM and maybe talk a little about the contribution of DRAM to the guide next quarter, is that primarily what's driving and is that sort of ramp more materially than some of the others into the second half or are we still waiting for it?
Dan Durn: Yes. Hi, Stacy. Thanks for the question. So I guess the best way to start the conversation. Let's talk about 2020 and then use that as a jumping-off point for what we saw in calendar Q1, our fiscal Q2 and then what we expect for the rest of the year. So in 2020, we talked about an overall WFE market that was up high-teens. I would say, the DRAM market was pretty much in line with that may be a little better than that. Against that opportunity, our DRAM business was up over 27%, almost 28% last year and significantly outperformed others in the industry that were up a few percent and down a few percent. So we had a really strong showing in 2020. And if you recall, three months ago on last quarter's call, we had signaled that the profile around the DRAM market, we view it as significantly back half loaded. So we expect off of calendar Q1, our fiscal Q2, momentum in that business to significantly pick up as our customers add bit supply to be more in line with that demand. And so we see that market playing out roughly in line with our expectations and how calendar Q1 played out. I would say, is pretty much in line with how we viewed the market three months ago, probably six months ago and it's playing out as expected. We see DRAM as a back half-loaded market this year.
Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Stacy, maybe I can add. This is Gary. Relative to the major inflections in DRAM, certainly high-speed DRAM, they're going to logic like structures in the periphery where Applied has leadership, I think we talked about that in our Memory Masterclass, couple of billion-dollar opportunity as those inflections are being adopted, capacitor scaling is another one where Applied has real strength, new patterning applications. So as Dan said, we had really great performance last year and as our customers are moving to these new structures, DRAM structures, we anticipate that we'll continue to outperform.
Operator: Our next question is from Vivek Arya with the Bank of America.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to revisit this cyclical versus secular aspect, but I think Gary or Dan mentioned, is WFE elevated right now because of capacity shortages, which would be more of a cyclical driver or is it elevated more because of secular reasons which would be rising complexity, et cetera. I wanted to get your perspective on that because when we ask the semiconductor companies, they say the shortages are perhaps not as much on the foundry side, they are more on the back-end. So I just wanted to get your perspective that what we are seeing right now, is it cyclical thing or is it more of a secular aspect?
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks, Vivek. I appreciate the question. Here is our point of view on this. What we see is we are in the very early innings of a multi-year secular growth trend around this industry. And I think we've been talking about it for a couple of years and now we see it really hitting its stride. When we think about the general consensus from third-party research, you're right about a trillion dollars of semiconductor revenues by 2030. The demand driving that is broad-based, you're seeing a hand-off from consumer-oriented devices to something that's far larger and more substantive around this fourth wave of compute, the data economy. By 2025, machines will generate 99% of the data, humans will generate 1%. You're seeing a decoupling of semiconductor demand for the first time in the industry's history from population and population growth in consumer behavior, content is increasing across devices, servers, autos, handsets. So what we see are strong secular growth drivers and we're in the early innings of that playing out. And I would say that that is more of what is driving our end markets today than anything else. And so when I look at that backdrop combined with things like an upper bias over time of capital intensity. I think the opportunity for our markets going forward is quite attractive and given what we talked about with the new playbook at our Investor Meeting, our opportunity to outperform as we drive those key inflections with our customers, our opportunity to outperform against that multiple-year secular growth tailwind around this industry, we think is quite substantial.
Gary Dickerson: Let me just add that certainly today we hear a lot about supply chain issues from an automotive perspective, but really we're - as Dan said and as we talked about in our Investor Meeting, we're in the early innings of every industry being transformed and the fundamental nature of competition being completely different. So semiconductor content is going to be at the foundation of that infrastructure. Certainly, the way we work, the way we learn, the way we shop, transportation, healthcare, today we're talking about automotive but content is going to increase more, I believe, than what anyone can see today and it's really about who delivers power performance and cost faster than others and enabling that infrastructure that is the basis of competition of every single industry. So and then from an Applied standpoint, as we've talked about classic 2D Moore's Law really ended a few years ago. And the foundation for the ships from the edge, the trillion edge devices to the high-speed computing in the data center is really about new materials, new structures, new ways to connect chips together, new architectures and new ways to shrink and Applied is just in a really tremendous position when you think about, again the basis of enabling a competitive advantage, time-to-market on all of that is incredibly important for the entire global economy, and certainly from a country standpoint, countries are starting to recognize the importance of semiconductors as a foundation for competition. So, definitely, we see this as a secular change and I really do believe people don't understand the magnitude of this yet.
Operator: Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Dan, I wanted to double-click on your NAND business. It was up significantly in the quarter both sequentially and year-over-year. At the same time, I think it was Gary, you talked about having relatively modest expectations for WFE for calendar 2021. So I guess the question is, are you guys gaining share or is the expectation for NAND to be first half weighted this year or is it a little bit of both? And kind of related to that, Dan you talked about more than $160 billion in WFE for this year and the next year combined. Within that sort of context, how are you thinking about NAND? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks Toshiya. Here's our perspective on NAND. If we were to go back three months to last quarter, we said that NAND was the one segment that was first half weighted versus second half. In the subsequent three months, that brings us to today, I would say, our perspective on NAND, it's strengthened a little bit but of the three segments, we've seen foundry, logic strengthen quite a bit, DRAM strengthened quite a bit and NAND strengthened a little bit. And while foundry, logic and NAND, we view as second-half weighted from a segment standpoint, I think there's a question mark on NAND where we sit today, is it first half weighted or second-half weighted? It's too early to tell and so we got out of the gate very strong in calendar Q1 on NAND. So we expect the growth rate to moderate quite a bit as we go throughout the year. And from a first half-second half weighting again, I think it's too early to call. When I take a step back and I think about the combination of 2021 plus 2022, what I would shape from an expectation standpoint around 2021. Foundry logic is greater than 55%, NAND is less than 45%, I'm sorry, foundry logic is greater than 55%, memory less than 45%. I think that construct still holds in 2022. As we think about a market that's up high 20% range in the current year, we think about foundry logic significantly outgrowing the industry average, DRAM being in line plus or minus with the industry average, NAND growing but significantly below the industry average. I think all three of those markets are strong levels of spend next year and we have an upward trajectory on the overall industry, but I think it's too early to shape expectations by device type. Let's some more time elapse, let's crystallize the contours of the industry this year and assess how our customers are going to invest to drive even higher returns for their investors in a few quarters. I think we'll have more to say in a few quarters from now.
Operator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.
Atif Malik: Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on Display, LCD spending mix has benefited during the pandemic and at the recent SID Display Conference Supply, you talked about the future OLED waves and micro-LED, curious if you can update us on the green shoots commentary you made 90 days ago and what's outlook for display for next year?
Dan Durn: Hi, Atif. Let me take a crack at this. So I think the display industry this year is going to play out very much in line with our expectations from our business perspective. We're well penetrated in the segments we participate in, we've got a good read on the market and we see our business in calendar or in fiscal 2021 being very similar to fiscal 2020. We talked about the environmental's strengthening, we still see older generation capacity coming out of the LCD market, we see increased consumer demand, a combination of that is leading to increased panel pricing, spot pricing in the panel market is going up and that's leading to increased profitability. So there's goodness there. We continue to see average area size increase. OLED screens are continuing to penetrate 5G handsets and OLED penetration of handsets in general is on an upward trajectory. The next leg of OLED growth into the IT market and the TV market and foldable phones becoming more widely-adopted from a consumer standpoint, all of that is intact. So we see an increase in the levels of investment as we go into next year, we feel good about that. The other thing I'd offer here is, we talked about an investment profile and our products to deepen our moats around our market position and get our product portfolio ready for the next leg up from an OLED investment standpoint. Exiting the year, the vast majority of those investments will be in the rear-view mirror and you're going to see us start to reposition this business for enhanced cash flow and profitability. We'll get into the low 20%s and then by 2023 and 2024, we'll be consistently operating this business with an operating margin between 25% and 30%. So we feel good about market development revenue growth as we look into 2022 and then complementing that with an enhanced level of profitability to drive value for investors.
Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.
Krish Sankar: Thanks for taking my question. I had a kind of a long-term question for Gary. Gary, when you look at some of the technology inflections like gate all around coming up, it seems like the critical technologies of the horizontal and vertical FTE, selective removal and conductor etch. Just wanted to find out from your advantage point what are the important technologies and more importantly can you help quantify the dollar opportunity it means for AMAG?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks for the question. So all of our customers are focused, as I said earlier, to deliver lower power, higher performance and better cost ahead of others. And we talked in the Investor Meeting about wiring innovations we're driving, improving wiring 50% and gate all around that's another very important technology if you look at the overall ecosystem. So that opportunity, I think we've estimated around $1 billion incremental opportunity and you think about the key enabling technologies certainly epitaxial deposition and selective removal are very important. We're working with every one of the leading customers on gate all around technologies. The other thing, I would say, that's important is our - and there are a number of other technologies where we have very strong positions, leadership position, so that will all ramp when gate all around goes into high volume manufacturing. But time to market is also important, the T of the PPACt and our e-beam technology leadership is really fundamental whether it's in the transistor, the wiring, the Draco, in memory or any of these different innovations, it's really mapping out and fingerprinting those processes because they're so complex with so many different variables and then being able to tune those recipes and the process knobs as fast as possible. So gate all around certainly is one of those cases where seeing things like residual germanium or seeing in those structures incredibly important and having enough of a picture across the chip whether you have isolated or dense structures across the wafer. But that's speed in the learning rate is very fundamental. So we have leadership in some of these foundational technologies for gate all around, but also our leadership in e-beam is really important for gate all around and other key inflections in the industry.
Operator: Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Great job on the quarterly execution and results. On the mature foundry logic and specialty manufacturing segments of the market, your ICAPs business, I think you guys had said last week, you expected this business to be $3 billion plus business for the team this year. But since then, I mean the supply-demand gap for the analog, microcontroller, power, MEMS guys has actually widen to somewhere around 20% to 40% in addition to the secular content gains that you guys talked about in auto and industrial and some of these customers are saying that they can't get two deliveries on orders placed today till next year. So do you guys have a revised estimate on your ICAPs business this year and similar to your overall business, do you guys expect ICAPs to grow in 2022?
Dan Durn: Thanks Harlan. Let me jump in and see if Gary wants to offer additional color after I take a crack at this. So we saw this trend towards more robust spending from a trailing node geometry, a specialty node geometry several years ago, we reorganized the organization, we've got leadership, driving this group and the company is performing incredibly well against this opportunity. We talked about this segment of our business being greater than $3 billion. We don't want to be more specific than that for competitive reasons, but it's much greater than $3 billion, but we'll just leave it at greater than $3 billion for now. Company has got great technology, great leadership positions. And then from a margin structure standpoint, it's accretive to the overall company margin and so as this business continues to grow for us and we'd be - continue to outperform. We think it's going to be value accretive for our investors. And so we feel good about how we're positioned and our ability to drive this market. Like we talked about, we're planning for our business to be up second half over first half. We've got an ability to continue to drive output and delivery of technology to customers. So we feel good about how we're positioned in this market as a key enabler of our customers to be able to satisfy their customers. So again, we saw this trend early and it's going to be a really value accretive part of our business, nice piece of our business going forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook. Gary maybe for you in terms of the process control business, you have overall good share or actually great share in the e-beam marketplace given the gains you've made with the Pro Vision tool yet recently you've introduced the new optical inspection kind of a hybrid tool with AI capability. Can you discuss where the future lies between e-beam versus optical inspection and how are your customers, I guess receiving the feedback in terms of the different technologies?
Gary Dickerson: Well, thanks for the question, Patrick. So maybe first let me start with our top level PDC business and then I'll get into this optical e-beam question. So really there is two major focus as far our PDC business. Certainly, this is a growth opportunity, but also what is increasingly important is PDC accelerating billions of dollars of Applied-enabled PPACt inflections. I talked about earlier gate all around in the wiring, in the memory and all of these different areas, and we have the highest resolution e-beam platform in the industry, we're probably 50% higher resolution. So we can see things that other platforms cannot see. We also have an advantage and the speed of imaging. So mapping out these fingerprints to dial-in these processes faster with bigger process margins that synergy Applied is the only company in the industry that has that combination of the unit processes, integrated material solutions and leading e-beam technology. So that is strategically important, and I think that really we see a great opportunity to accelerate our PDC revenue going forward. We talked about 50% growth this year on the top of 25% last year, but also that pull in the synergy with the rest of Applied Materials is incredibly valuable and very important. Relative to optical inspection, we did introduce this new platform the Enlight. We see very strong pull and adoption especially in leading foundry. And the combination of these technologies, basically you have optical inspection system that is incredibly cost-effective for line monitoring types of applications and certainly in the discussions that I have with many of the R&D leaders, tremendous pull for that technology but also combining that with industry-leading resolution to accurately classify defect and then having that capability to combine with AI gives customers a better overall performance in finding yield limiting defects. So we're seeing definitely strong adoption of this concept with customers, but the key thing for me really is the e-beam leadership that is fundamental, where more than five times larger than our overall largest PDC competitor. We have clear imaging leadership, we will be introducing a new imaging technologies that will further strengthen our leadership in that part of our - in that part of PDC and the synergy in the T for PPACt is very, very, very important.
Operator: Our next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company.
Quinn Bolton: Just wanted to ask about the China business, China looks like it was a record on the dollar basis and about a third of revenue, did that business skew a little bit more to NAND, given the NAND strength, are you still seeing that being pretty broad-based?
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks, Quinn. As we look at our China business, it was a strong performance in the most recent quarter, but it's in line generally with the historical profile of that business over time, some quarters will be a little better than others, but certainly in line with the historical profile on a percent of our overall business. As I take a look and double click at the China domestic market and think about the levels of investment there, I would say, that there is slow steady development of the ecosystem. I see investments from a 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter standpoint. And then within the 300-millimeter geometries, we see investments across all device types, we see NAND, we see DRAM, we see foundry logic. So I wouldn't say it's driven by one specific market, one specific customer. It's really broad-based both from a customer perspective as well as a market perspective. We feel good about how we're positioned against this opportunity and we'll do well over time as that business continues to grow.
Operator: Our next question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.
Pierre Ferragu: So Dan you mentioned that if we give it some time and if we believe in industry heading towards the $1 trillion, we could have like with we've been spending in $140 billion. So let's say over five years or maybe a bit more, we could still see WFE doubling? And then Gary, you talked a lot about like this upcoming inflection points to reach, we feel very close now, where materials is almost taking a revenge of a critical dimension rejection. And so my question was, in a world in which the industry spends $150 billion more or so in equipment spending the incremental $70 billion that would be spend compared to what is spend today, where would that go, if you could give like what in your view would be this most significant drivers of growth for the industry over that kind of long time period where we double again spending?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question, Pierre. So for me, I spend a lot of my time with customers across our entire or all the different market segments. The leading customers, ICAPs I spent a tremendous amount of time there more than ever. And I have a very strong perspective and we can see things that we can't talk about publicly relative to where customers are going, but I really believe that we're at the point where we have the biggest economic competition of our lifetime with technology transforming every industry and semiconductors are part of that key-infrastructure, the data economy going forward and it really is about power, performance and cost from the edge to the cloud and everything in between. And I do believe it and we can see it when you go from 5 to 3, 3 to 2 and what's going beyond that that the playbook that we discussed before and you even see customers supporting this view that the classic 2D Moore's Law will not enable the future infrastructure. I think that is crystal clear and it really is, certainly there is going to be shrink as part of that 2D shrink, but that's not going to enable power and performance across the whole infrastructure for the future. So it's about the new materials, it's about the new structures, the gate all around, 50% reduction in wiring, high-speed memory for a number of different applications, we're adding logic to the periphery, shaping the chip architectures in a very different way. And the other thing and we talked about - I talked about this earlier on the call, packaging is, I think, underappreciated and very important. This year packaging will be over $800 million for us and you think about connecting chips or chiplets or IP blocks that is going to be an enormous opportunity going forward and Applied is in a great position. We have very strong products in PVD, CVD, CMP, plating, this new hybrid bonding technology where you can bond two chips together. We're the only company in the industry that has a full flow advanced packaging lab. So Pierre, I think there is going to be tremendous innovation that's happening there and again, that's another segment of the industry where I think people under-appreciate how important from a competitive standpoint and in a PPACt enabling standpoint that's going to be. So again, those are the things that that we see as we go forward. It's really about those five elements of the new playbook and the other aspect is time to market, that's where we're focused with AIx and especially our industry leadership in e-beam to drive the T.
Operator: Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: Dan, I guess I had a two-part question just about WFE and your share. So you gave a 2020 WFE number from VLSI that's like $61 billion and you did $12.1 billion in SSD last year so that's about 20% WFE share. Then, if I take your July SSD guidance, we know that you're doing about $8.2 billion in the first half and you're saying that it's going to be up in the back half so that's like $16.5 billion to $17 billion for the year, which off of your high $70 billion WFE number is like 21.5% WFE share. So that's up like a 150 basis points this year. So I guess my question is where is that share coming from, can you sort of double-click on that. I know you highlighted process control, but I'm wondering if you can kind of double-click on that? And then the second part of question was for domestic China, you had talked about $10 billion WFE this year, is that still the thinking? Thanks.
Dan Durn: Yes. So Tim, thanks for the question. I think it's important to really get the facts on the table for 2020. If you look at our semi systems business in calendar 2020, it's up 26.5% against the market that was up high teens and so significant outperformance, we view it as gaining 60 basis points of share, so we ended 2020 at 20.5% WFE share. And so your reference to 21.5% share in 2021, we think we're going to significantly outperform this year. You saw us grow almost two to one in foundry logic last year, you saw us significantly outperform peers in 2020 in the DRAM market and we showed strength in our NAND business. And when I look at the customers, node over node whether it's memory or foundry logic, our opportunity is going up. When I look at the end-market profile, we talked about its strength in foundry logic, DRAM, strong business in NAND. So we feel good about the market perspective. And then when I look at the product portfolio, we showed share gains and deposition and removal and process control, Gary talked about packaging, we talked about 240 basis points of conductor etch, 220 basis points of CVD, we talked about strength in PVD, Epi, thermals. 2021, I would expect to do even better across that product portfolio. We talked about the new PPACt playbook, we talked a lot about the enabling technologies at our Investor Meeting, we've held one Masterclass, we've got an upcoming Masterclass on foundry logic. We see these inflections is real. We've got the industry's broadest portfolio of industry-leading technologies and we've got unique abilities to combine those technologies and bring them together in a way to solve our customers highest value problems. And so we feel good about our position, our momentum and our ability to outperform in these markets. And so from a - I'm sorry, Tim, your second question.
Timothy Arcuri: Sorry, again, thanks. Yes, I was just asking about domestic China WFE, I thought you said something like flat year-over-year around $10 billion this year. I was just kind of wondering if you had an update there?
Dan Durn: Yes. So what we said on the last earnings call as we see it up several billion on a year-over-year basis. And as more of the year progresses, I think what we see is domestic China maybe profiling in line with the overall WFE markets and we'll keep an eye on it and we'll keep updating each and every quarter, but we kind of see it up in line with the overall market.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, great, operator. So I think we're at the end of the hour. So Dan would you like to help us close off the call.
Dan Durn: Yes. Sure, Mike. Thanks. So what I'm really struck by this quarter. It's just a broad validation of the trends. We've been talking about for quite some time from the data economy and the opportunity that it creates for the semi-industry and that's at virtually every node to the challenges that Gary talked about with 2D scaling. The industry just needs new ways to deliver the PPACt roadmap. Our customers are committed to very large multi-year investments, but they're also coming at it from a position of financial strength, which is really great and bodes well for the industry long-term. We're going to fully support them with the R&D investments that we make, that'll drive the roadmap, solve our customers highest value problems. We're going to generate profitable growth and we're going to return a lot of cash to shareholders over time. Gary and I hope to see many of you at the Virtual conferences in the next few weeks. And then, I hope you'll join us and our technical leaders on the Logic Masterclass that we're going to have on June 16. Mike let's go ahead and wrap up the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, great. Thanks Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of our call will be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific Time. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-02-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Applied's First Quarter of Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On April 6, Applied plans to host a virtual investor meeting to discuss our markets, strategies and financial targets. We hope you'll save the date. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. I'm very pleased to report another quarter of record performance for Applied Materials. Since the beginning of our fiscal year, we've seen a continued acceleration of demand in our semiconductor business as major macro and industry trends, fuel increasing consumption of silicon across a wide range of markets and applications. 2020 was an excellent year for Applied as we outperformed our markets, while growing our earnings nearly twice as fast as revenue. We carry this strong momentum into 2021. Our broad portfolio and exposure to technology inflections, combined with the traction of our new products, put us in a great position to substantially outgrow our markets, again this year and into the future. I want to thank our employees and suppliers for everything they are doing to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Our operations and field teams are doing an incredible job, as we run the company at record levels and successfully overcome significant logistics and other challenges created by the pandemic. In R&D, our teams are working in new ways to accelerate the time to market of critical innovations for our customers and we're doing all of this, while maintaining a relentless focus on keeping our colleagues and families safe. As Mike outlined, we plan to hold an investor meeting in early April. At that event, we will provide our in-depth analysis of the major growth drivers and inflections that will shape our markets over the next 5 to 10 years and describe our strategy to deliver innovative new technologies to enable our customers' power performance and cost road maps, accelerate their time to market and drive Applied's long-term profitable growth. In today's call, I will focus my comments on the near-term, first, covering the dynamics we currently see in the market and then highlighting some of our recent accomplishments that illustrate the momentum we have across the business. Starting with a high-level view of our markets, we are seeing a diverse combination of macro and technology factors, fueling very strong and sustainable demand for semiconductors. As the world continues to navigate the current challenges and prepares for a post-pandemic era, the digital transformation of the economy is being accelerated. Companies are rethinking and reengineering the way they operate and there's an immense pull for advanced technology. In addition, consumers are making different choices about the way they spend their time, and the products and services they buy. I strongly believe many of the changes we're seeing today are irreversible, since new ways of working offer compelling advantages in terms of time and productivity. Within the electronics ecosystem itself, key technology inflections are driving increasing silicon consumption. I'll highlight three examples. Cloud service providers are forecasting data center CapEx growth of more than 15% this year on top of record spending in 2020. With the broader adoption of 5G handsets, silicon content in smartphones is growing at double-digit rates. And in automotive, where there are known supply shortfalls, total semi consumption is expected to expand more than 15% this year, translating these factors to industry investments. In foundry/logic, leading-edge investments are very strong and have been well articulated by our customers. On top of that, our ICAPS business that serves the IoT, communications, auto, power and sensor markets is expected to grow even faster and is on track to exceed $3 billion of revenue for the fiscal year. And then, 2020 was a strong recovery year, with spending up more than 30%. And in 2021, we expect customers to invest at modestly higher levels. In DRAM, supply-demand fundamentals look more favorable than NAND. And as a result, we still expect DRAM investments to outgrow NAND this year. All of this adds up to a very strong demand environment for wafer fab equipment and we believe this strength is sustainable well beyond 2021. Digital transformation touches every sector of the economy and is nondiscretionary for many industries. In addition, industry investments appear disciplined. When you look at wafer fab equipment intensities, that's wafer fab equipment revenues as a percentage of semiconductor industry revenues, they are well below recent peaks in all three of the device segments: foundry/logic, NAND and DRAM. Turning to Applied's business performance. Our Semiconductor Systems revenues for the first fiscal quarter were up 26% compared to the same period last year. At the midpoint of our Q2 guidance, Semi Systems will be up around 50% year-on-year. And based on our current outlook, we expect to again grow faster than the market for the year as a whole. There are a number of factors contributing to this outstanding performance. First, our business is very well balanced across devices and customers. Second, we have the broadest portfolio of products and capabilities, spanning materials creation, modification, removal and analysis. These technologies, combined with our ability to connect them in unique ways, are fundamental to enabling our customers' power, performance and cost road maps. And third, we have an incredible pipeline of new products and integrated solutions that are winning applications, expanding our served opportunities and reducing the time it takes our customers to bring important new innovations to market. Node-over-node opportunity growth in both foundry/logic and memory favors Applied's leadership businesses, including epi, thermal processing, CMP and PVD. In fact, we believe our PVD business can grow more than 40% this year and generate more than $3 billion of revenue. Our latest-generation products have strong momentum and more than 25% of our 2021 revenues will come from critical applications that we've targeted and won since 2018. Some highlights include: CVD, where we grew revenues 30% in 2020 and have strong customer pull for new differentiated material solutions that are highly enabling for advanced patterning; conductor etch, where we're winning new applications in DRAM and foundry/logic that contributed to our 32% revenue growth in this market last year; process diagnostics and control, where we believe we can grow more than 25% this fiscal year on top of the 45% growth we delivered in 2020, thanks to new optical wafer inspection and e-beam products that are still in the early stages of adoption; in packaging, where we expect revenues to be up 50% year-on-year on top of strong growth in 2020. Also, over the past few years we've started introducing a new class of highly differentiated products that we call Integrated Materials Solutions or IMS. Our IMS products can combine multiple process technologies with onboard metrology and sensors within a single system that are capable of enabling unique films, structures and devices. We have numerous IMS engagements with our leading customers. And this year we will generate meaningful revenues from our initial IMS products. Moving to service. AGS delivered another record quarter. Over the past five years, we've grown our services business at a compound annual growth rate of 12%, which is twice as fast as our installed base growth. In this period, we've increased the percentage of service and parts revenue generated by service agreements from around 40% to more than 60%. These long-term agreements enable us to deliver more value to customers with our advanced service products, while providing us with stickier and more predictable recurring revenue streams. Our renewal rates for these agreements are also very high at over 90%.  Finally, in display. Our outlook remains consistent with the view we shared in November. We expect 2021 revenues to be similar to 2020 as we continue to manage through the current market trough. We do see encouraging leading indicators of future growth including higher OLED adoption in the smartphone market with the vast majority of 5G handsets being equipped with OLED screens and increasing OLED consumption beyond phones in TVs and IT applications. We still believe OLED is a compelling technology and this inflection is a great catalyst for the display market that will create expanded opportunities for Applied.  Before I hand the call over to Dan, I want to again thank all our employees for their outstanding contributions to Applied's success. 2021 is off to a great start with record results and outlook. We see strong and sustainable demand in our semiconductor business fueled by a combination of macro and technology drivers. We have great momentum thanks to our broad market exposure and differentiated portfolio of new products. And we believe we're in a great position to outperform our markets again this year. Finally, we're looking forward to sharing our long-term vision for the industry and Applied Materials at our investor event in April. Now Dan will give his perspective on the business environment and provide more color on our financial results and operational performance. Dan? 
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. Today I'll begin by summarizing Applied's performance in Q1 and then I'll share some of the key drivers of our growth relative to the markets in calendar 2020 and I'll finish with our guidance for Q2.  Beginning with our Q1 performance. Applied delivered record revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. We grew revenue by 24% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance. I'm pleased that we increased gross margin by around 100 basis points year-over-year, particularly since we are still experiencing COVID-related manufacturing protocols and logistics costs.  We also generated record non-GAAP operating profit of nearly $1.5 billion, which was up 40% year-over-year. We increased non-GAAP EPS by 42% year-over-year to $1.39.  Our teams operated with discipline and this enabled Applied to deliver record free cash flow of $1.3 billion, which was up 47% year-over-year. We increased cash and investments on the balance sheet by nearly $950 million to $8.22 billion as we await the regulatory decision for the Kokusai Electric transaction. I look forward to updating you on our capital allocation plans when we get together for the investor meeting in April.  Turning to the segments. Our Semi Systems group increased revenue by 26% year-over-year including new quarterly records in Etch, metal deposition and CMP. Operating margin grew by 320 basis points year-over-year. Applied Global Services also delivered revenue above our expectations, while reporting its highest operating margin over the past two years despite ongoing challenges related to COVID.  The display group exceeded its revenue target and increased operating margin by 590 basis points year-over-year. Looking ahead, our demand outlook calls for growth. We currently expect all three of our segments to post higher revenue in the second-half of our fiscal year.  Next I'll comment on our semiconductor equipment revenue performance in calendar 2020, which is equal to our Q2 of fiscal 2020 through Q1 of fiscal 2021. As I previewed on our November earnings call, 2020 was a memory growth year in which NAND equipment spending grew at nearly twice the rate of the overall market. DRAM customer spending also grew faster than the market and foundry/logic investments grew slower than the overall market, but still accounted for over 55% of total spending.  Applied has balanced share and our revenue profile resembled the overall mix with our highest growth in NAND at 34%. We grew by 27% in DRAM and 23% in foundry/logic and we believe we significantly outperformed in both of these end markets.  Within the semi systems group our growth was strongest in areas where we've made significant investments to drive the new playbook, to develop integrated material solutions for our customers and introduce new products where we have significant room to gain share. One of our fastest-growth areas was in advance packaging, where we have the industry's broadest portfolio and by far the highest share. As Gary said, we expect this momentum to continue into 2021. Our dollar growth was highest in CVD and etch, which reflects the success we've had co-optimizing new CVD films with our Sym3 etch system to create unique patterning solutions across 3D NAND, DRAM and foundry-logic. Among new products, our latest optical wafer inspection system grew by 44% in 2020, achieving over $400 million in cumulative revenue. We'll officially introduce the new system in the near future to explain its unique architectural features, along with breakthrough AI capabilities, that are generating strong customer pull. Turning to calendar 2021. We expect strong foundry-logic spending to continue. We also expect DRAM spending to grow at a faster pace than NAND. This 2021 mix expectation plays particularly well to Applied's technology innovations and strong product roadmap. Now I'll share our Q2 business outlook. We expect company revenue to be approximately $5.39 billion plus or minus $200 million. The midpoint would be up about 36% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $1.50 plus or minus $0.06 or up about 70% year-over-year. Within this outlook, we project Semiconductor Systems revenue of $3.85 billion, up around 50% year-over-year and AGS revenue of about $1.14 billion, up around 12% year-over-year. These forecasts do not include any revenue from shipments that still require government licenses. We expect Display revenue of around $370 million, with growth resuming in the second-half. We expect Applied's non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%, or up around 240 basis points year-over-year and we expect non-GAAP OpEx to increase to $890 million. Our Q2 guidance assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 12% to 13% and a weighted average share count of around 929 million. In summary, I'm pleased that Applied delivered another quarter of record performance in Q1, with strong year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. I'd like to join Gary in thanking our teams for supporting our customers under challenging circumstances and operating with discipline to generate higher margins and free cash flow. Execution by our employees has been and continues to be nothing short of superb in what is still a challenging COVID environment. We look forward to giving you more insights into our markets and our company's growth plans at the investor meeting in April. Now Mike let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. Now to help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today’s call. If you have a second question, please just requeue and we will do our best to come back you later in the session. Operator, let’s please begin.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, if you look back to 2020, it looks like you outperformed WFE by about 8 percentage points. And obviously, you talked about favorable mix coming into 2021 led by foundry and DRAM as well as I assume your strong position on the legacy side. So curious if you can kind of speak to what kind of outperformance we should be thinking about relative to WFE in 2021, and if you can point to the particular drivers that we should be focused on? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, C.J. So in 2020, if we say the markets around $60 billion in 2020, and I would say, it's up a little more than 16% against that backdrop. If you look at our Semi Systems segment, we grew our Semi Systems segment revenue by 26.5%, so significant outperformance as you've called out. As we look at the drivers in 2020 foundry/logic grew below the industry average. It was really a memory-driven growth year; NAND about 2x; DRAM a little more than the industry average. So the company performed really well in that environment. As you go to 2021, we view the spend mix to be a more favorable environment for us as a company. Foundry/logic will continue to be strong in 2021. We see DRAM outgrowing NAND. And so against that more favorable spend mix, we would expect to significantly outperform the market again this year. So we feel really good about how we're positioned against the market opportunity. We've got robust end markets and strong product momentum within those end markets so we feel good. And then as we look beyond 2021, we see from an overall market standpoint and a company-specific momentum standpoint, we see continued strong performance into 2022. So, again, we like how well we're positioned. 2021 is a more favorable mix and I would expect us to significantly outperform again.
Gary Dickerson : Yes. C.J., this is Gary. Thanks for the question. I'll give a little bit more color relative to our specific opportunities. If you look at the industry overall, certainly, technology is transforming every aspect of our lives. That's driving the overall business sustainably higher. And at the same time, we've talked about 2D scaling coming to an end. So really -- and you can even see in recent meetings with some of our largest customers where they're publicly talking about the road map going forward around new chip architectures, new structures, new materials, new ways to connect chips together, design technology co-optimization, again around certain structures and materials. And so that's really where we're focused. And when you think about what's going to enable the future, it really is about new structures, new materials. We talked about packaging up 50% new ways to connect chips together. And we're just in a sweet spot relative to the technologies we have. When you think about creating those new structures and new materials, PVD is a big driver for us. Our epi business is going to be very strong this year. The thermal processing CVD all of those areas are very strong. Etch, we're continuing to win. And when you think about shaping those structures, our Selectra product is a leader in the industry, creating and shaping those structures, and then the modification with CMP and implant. And then in PDC, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, that business is growing for us. So I can certainly give more color later on the call on that. But again, we're just in a really great position. When you think about what's going to enable the future inflections and the power and performance for the infrastructure going forward, we've never been in a better position.
Dan Durn: And C.J. maybe one more point to add to what Gary is saying. And as I went through the profile of spend one data point I left out was the aggregate size of the market in 2021. I think we'll have more to say in a point-specific way around overall WFE size in 2021 and beyond at the investor meeting coming up here in about six weeks. But if the overall industry consensus today, is call it, high 60s, $70 billion, I'd say our view is a bit higher than that as we sit here today.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, C.J. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions and congratulations on the solid results and guide. Dan, it's probably not all that surprising that half-on-half growth is expected both in services and display. But in the Semi System businesses, that's a little bit different than kind of the tone that some of your peers have talked about with kind of a first-half weighting of WFE. And it might be explained by your last comment to C.J.'s question about having a little bit higher view on overall WFE. But I'm kind of curious given that your fiscal year doesn't match up with the calendar year, do you think on a calendar year basis that we're going to have a stronger second-half than first-half? And just relative to your fiscal year commentary, what gives you the bottoms-up confidence of half-on-half growth specifically in the Semi Systems business?
Dan Durn: Yes. Sure John. Thanks for the question. Let me try to unpack it a little bit, so we can talk about sort of what we're seeing in our business versus maybe what others see in theirs. So, I guess, the first thing I'd point to is, we've got very broad end-market exposure. We're very balanced across all three device types; foundry/logic, NAND, DRAM really strong positions in each of those end markets. But within those markets, we've got product breadth and momentum around a number of our businesses. So we've got more balanced end-market exposure than, say, some who are more narrowly focused. Second thing, I'd point to and this ties into the answer I just gave to C.J.'s question, we've got a more favorable mix setup in 2021 with foundry/logic continuing to be strong, DRAM outgrowing NAND. So I think that serves us well for continued and significant outperformance. And then we talked about carrying the momentum, both from a market and product standpoint into 2022. So I feel good about how that transition looks. And then lastly, as you rightfully pointed out, within the fiscal year, we see back-half momentum with each of our respective reporting segments. So again, where we sit today, we think we're really well set up for strong performance throughout the year.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. For either Gary or Dan, there's a lot of talk of chip shortages these days. Do you think this $70 billion WFE for the industry is sufficient to address these shortages? Or can the WFE number be higher? Or do you think that this actually could push out some of the demand into next year as well before the shortages are fully met? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes. So, a couple of things on that, Vivek. First of all, our number for the aggregate size in 2021, we weren't point-specific, but we're a little higher than where the -- a bit higher than where the industry consensus is. I do think there's good strong positive momentum. I think the capacity our customers put in place is around multi-year demand statements. To make these investments make sense over the long run, drive a return on those investments, there has to be a substantive not a transitorial demand statement that sits behind those investments our customers make. And so we do think there's a bit of catch-up spend. When you think about shortages in the auto industry, we think that's going to be a good end market. But I don't think that market in and of itself is sufficiently large to drive the types of demand that we're talking about in the current environment. So then we look at greater than $70 billion in 2021. The demand statement that sits behind that, it's diverse. It's broad. All the respective end markets NAND, DRAM, foundry/logic are strong. Some grow faster than others. And it's on the back of these trends we've been talking about playing out over time. We think we're in the very early innings. This is going to be a decade-plus investment cycle. Semiconductors are going to be on the key path of enabling some pretty major trends that play out around the world. And so, our customers are going to be disciplined. They'll continue to add capacity where it makes sense, but it will be in support of what is a more substantive long-term demand statement in the market as opposed to any near-term dynamic that will be temporary in nature.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about gross margins. Dan you showed nice upside in the January quarter. I was curious what drove that. And then for April, you're guiding up margins nicely both sequentially and year-over-year. Where are the puts and takes there? And I guess going into the second-half of the fiscal year, would it be fair to assume sort of a gradual progression higher given potentially faster growth in your leadership products and hopefully COVID inefficiencies going away? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Toshiya. When I think about gross margins, company is performing well. We're up 100 basis points year-over-year in the most recent quarter's results. On the guide, we're up about 240 basis points year-over-year, and that's against the backdrop of still some pretty sizable headwinds as it relates to the pandemic safety protocols in our factories logistics costs to move material around the world. And so, I think the company is performing extremely well in the current environment. And when I think about what's driving that, there's a set of company-specific actions that drive discipline and efficiency into the core operations of the business. No matter where our gross margins are, I will never be satisfied. We've had a number of actions inside of the company to drive that efficiency, to drive that discipline into the core of the operations, and we're beginning to see some of those really take hold in the current environment. So we feel good about the work streams, a lot of hard work inside of the company doing some really hard work and fundamental things to drive that efficiency. You'll always have an element of customer mix and what we happen to be selling in any one quarter that will influence things from quarter-to-quarter, but there's a whole host of substantive actions that we think are serving the company really well in the current environment. As I look forward into the back half of the fiscal year, this is not a 1-quarter phenomenon. The top end of our long-term target model for gross margin was 47%. And even in the COVID environment we're operating at that level. I would expect us in the back half of the year to be -- continue to be in the 46.5% to 47% top end of our long-term model. At our Analyst Day, we'll talk about what we see beyond the current horizon over the next several years and opportunities we see to work the gross margins up even higher off of these levels but definitely not a 1-quarter phenomenon. Company is performing well. 
Toshiya Hari: Thank you, congrats.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Question is for Gary. Gary we've heard European Union looking into building or redeveloping fabs in Europe. There is a great deal of buzz among investors that semiconductors have become strategic. Are you engaged with any kind of discussions with Washington D.C. on this topic? 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Let me -- so I do think that everyone can see that relative to economic growth and employment growth going forward, it's going to look different. And the digital transformation of every industry is being accelerated in the current environment that we're in. So this is very strategic from -- again from an economic and employment growth perspective. From Applied's perspective, we have been engaged with customers and also government initiatives around investments in different locations. And what I would say from Applied's perspective there are a couple of things to think about. One is, as these companies are moving into new locations, you have to look at the scale of the factories that they're building and -- at least what's been announced is smaller scale somewhat less efficient. Now supply-demand eventually works itself out but that somewhat less efficient factory size is a positive for Applied. And the other thing what we've seen in every case where a company is moving from one geographic location where they have tremendous amount of talent concentration and experience that, that creates an opportunity for our service business as they move into a new location. So I think both of those things the factory efficiency and the service business, our service agreements are much higher also in those cases. That creates an opportunity for us. This can play out over time. But certainly I think from a strategic perspective we can all see that the pull there is very strong. 
Atif Malik: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong results especially the op margins in Jan quarter, given I think it was a 14-week quarter. The question I had for Gary was, you spoke about process control growing over 40% last year and possibly over 20% this year which is very impressive, given you're outgrowing peers. Just kind of curious is it all primarily coming from the new optical inspection tool? Or is e-beam patterning adding some extra fuel to it? Or can you give some puts and takes around the PDC growth this year? 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thank you, Krish. So really I would say there's three major drivers. One is the new optical wafer inspection system where we've seen tremendous pull. And especially in foundry -- leading foundry we've seen a tremendous ramp of that new optical wafer inspection system. And it really gives the customers tremendous performance at a much better cost of ownership so they can insert inspection points in more places in the line and that has a big impact on the speed of the yield ramp. So that's really in the early phase of adoption, the new optical wafer inspection system. Our e-beam products are tremendously strong. If you look at a 2021, our e-beam growth would exceed every prior year for PDC total systems business other than 2020. So that business is very strong. We have leadership in electron optics. We've introduced a new source technology that gives us much higher resolution, much faster imaging in one segment of the EB market. We will take that core technology in electron optics across all of our different platforms, and it creates just a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to extend our leadership in the e-beam part of the market. So that's growing very fast. And the third thing I would say that's really important, when you think about power performance area and cost, what's really important to our customers is how fast they can drive all of those different key metrics. So accelerating certainly for us and for them, we talk about PPACt is enormously important. And there are cases with the -- especially our e-beam products where you can generate orders of magnitude more data in a much faster period of time. So when you're thinking about optimizing the new materials, the new structures with unique imaging and algorithms to accelerate both our internal R&D at Applied and also the PPACt road map for our customers that synergy is increasing from an overall company perspective. So again, I think the optical inspection we're in the early phase of the adoption. E-beam leadership in imaging. We'll extend that leadership with new capabilities. And the synergies with our overall business has never been better and never been more important for us and for our customers.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur : Good afternoon, and great job on the quarterly execution. The chip shortages in the industry are across leading-edge and lagging-edge technologies probably more so on lagging edge just to support analog, mixed signal, microcontroller products that feed into the auto and industrial markets. And I think these customers are scrambling to add capacity. What's order activity been like for lagging-edge tools? And it looks like lagging-edge and IoT contributed about 25% of your systems business last year. Do you guys expect that mix to grow this year? And how do operating margins for these tools compare to the overall systems segment?
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Harlan. Let me just pull up some statistics on the split. So trailing-node versus leading-edge this year we kind of see -- if it was maybe -- yes, it's probably a follow-through on 70-30 again this year: 70% leading-edge, 30% trailing-node geometries. As we go back in time, we've been talking about this a fair amount here over the last couple of years. So strength on the trailing-node geometries is -- has not been new. In fact, if we go back 2010 to 2020 take that 10-year window, if the foundry business over that time in aggregate grew just about 90% a little bit less, the trailing-node geometries have been above the foundry segment average at about just over 110% growth. Leading-edge has grown at about just over 75%. So this trend has been playing out for quite some time. We're well positioned in this segment. We're delivering key technologies and the company is performing well. This will be very value-accretive to us as this segment of the market continues to grow and outgrow WFE.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Harlan, I can add just maybe a little bit to this. I think this opportunity in what people refer to as specialty semiconductor is significant. About two years ago, we formed an organization we call ICAPs focused on IoT communication auto power sensors, pulling together all of our capabilities across the company. And we now see this as one of the fastest-growing opportunities within Applied Materials. And when you think about what drives those markets, whether it's sensor technologies or power devices, RF any of those types of businesses, it really plays to our leadership products: epi, PVD, CVD, implant, thermal, CMP, etch and PDC. So we really have a good position there. We pulled together an incredibly strong group within Applied and we also have a focused device integration team just on those particular devices. So we talk about Integrated Material Solutions and we have some really dynamite integration engineers beyond the unit processes so that our role -- our strategic role in enabling that market has been increasing as we've refocused the organization. So, as Dan said, we're really optimistic, and we think some of these markets could be some of the fastest-growing markets over the next several years.
Harlan Sur: Great insights. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. My question's on the services business. You had a lot of upside there relative to the commentary, the guidance on the quarter. Can you talk about what's driving that? Is that telling us that customer utilizations are better? Or just what should we infer by the upside there and how sustainable those trends could be?
Dan Durn: Yes. So thanks, Joe. So we talked about in the prepared comments growing this business at twice the rate of our overall installed base. So this has been playing out over multiple years. Company has done a good job outgrowing the installed base. We're outgrowing it 2:1 over, an extended period of time. Embedded in that growth are a couple of things. Service entitlement on the new technologies is greater than what we used to ship, say a decade ago or more. The technology is more complex. The customers' integration windows, process windows are tighter, so it requires continually tighter specs and the performance of our equipment and tighter windows. And so that creates a nice adder as well. And then when you think about the strategy, five years ago we had around 40% of our revenue covered by long-term service agreements. The vast majority of those service agreements had a tenor of about one year in duration. Fast-forward to today, we've penetrated over 60% of the revenue covered by long-term service agreements. A third of those long-term service agreements have now stretched out their tenor beyond one year so we feel really good about the value that we're adding to customers. And it's underpinning nice growth for the business. So we feel good about the strategy. We feel good about the execution of the opportunity and it's a nice stable source of profitability, cash flow and value creation for our shareholders. So business is performing well.
Joe Moore: I mean it seems like a really good business. I'm just surprised that there's so much upside relative to 14 weeks ago. Specifically, what was -- I guess you guided to $1.07 billion and came in at $1.155 billion. What is that upside being driven by?
Dan Durn: So if it's a specific comment around the most recent quarter, everybody puts assumptions into their models about how you respond in a current environment, where you're seeing some spikes with respect to the pandemic in different geographies and just making sure that we recovered from an execution standpoint on unknowable things, as we extrapolate those data points to different populations around the globe. We went into that quarter a bit more conservative than we typically would, as a result of those pandemic statistics we are seeing in the fall.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Joe.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. I wanted to ask you a clarification and a question. The clarification is just does your guidance incorporate any shutdown at the Austin manufacturing site due to the deep freeze going on in Texas? And then my follow-on question is a follow-on to Atif's question about the US and European Union to the extent that they provide local support for local supply chains for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, would you see that that WFE spending being additive? Or is that just sort of a reallocation of WFE spending from what otherwise would have taken place in Asia to either the US and Europe? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Quinn. So from an Austin manufacturing standpoint, I would say our business was subjected to the power fluctuations that most commercial enterprises -- manufacturing enterprises saw in Austin. What I would say is we don't see a material impact to the business. We think the weather gets better here another day, power stabilizes. We've been in close contact as you can imagine with our team there. We've got risk-mitigation plans in place. We've got labor prepositioned. I think we're ready to respond quickly once the power stabilizes. And the guidance we've put forward contemplates everything that's going on in that region and the way we are going to respond and drive output as quickly as possible, once we get the stable power back and so we feel good about where we sit today in support of the guide that we put out there. As it relates to localization of supply chains disaggregation of manufacturing footprint, here's what I would say from a business impact standpoint and a market perspective. I would say global supply is going to meet global demand. And Gary mentioned that, if you've got two 50,000 wafer start a month factories that's less a capital-efficient manufacturing footprint than one large 100,000 wafer start a month facility. So while I don't think it's a step-function change from an overall wafer fab equipment standpoint, I would say that wafer fab equipment is probably positively biased to the upside as a result of those multiple smaller-scale facilities. The other impact I would say from a business perspective as these supply chains localize is, we've got a great global footprint of our service organization. They do great things for our customers around the globe. When our customers locate capacity in areas outside of their home geography that's been a nice service adder. We've seen a nice service adder and increased entitlement on that capacity historically and I would expect that to continue. So we think that that's going to be a nice tailwind for our service business as that trend materializes going forward.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Quinn.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Dan, I just want to ask you on OpEx and I feel a little guilty asking given the op margin performance. But considering OpEx in the quarter is up a decent amount. So just maybe what's driving that other than I guess higher commissions? And then just any thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year?
Dan Durn: Yes. So a couple of things and thanks for the question Blayne. Just a couple of things on the transition from Q1 to Q2. What I would observe about Q1 is as we get a holiday shutdown in that period at the end of a calendar year. You also have partial impact of annual merit increases one-month impact. As we move into Q2, you no longer have a shutdown and you get a full quarter impact of merit increases. So there's an embedded cost escalator in that time frame. The other thing I would say and Gary spent a lot of time talking about this, there is a very fundamental transition happening in our industry. Traditional Moore's Law is shrinking -- I mean traditional Moore's Law 2D shrinks are beginning to hit a wall. The industry is pivoting to a new playbook and we have a meaningful key enablement role to play in each element of that new playbook. We are going to be disciplined, but we are going to invest to grow. We're going to drive innovation. We're going to be a key enabler of our customers' road maps. From a discipline standpoint, I think the company has got a good track record. From an OpEx perspective close to 70% of what we spend is fuel for growth R&D with pretty tight containment from a discretionary spend standpoint. So, we're close to 70% of all OpEx goes to R&D. And then from an OpEx leverage perspective, an observation I would make is -- and this goes to growing the company in a very disciplined manner delivering innovation, but doing it in an efficient manner. Over the last 12 months, we've got 340 basis points of OpEx leverage that we've delivered. And if I take it out to eight quarters, we've got to 460 basis points of OpEx leverage that we've delivered to the P&L. So I think the company has demonstrated a great track record of delivering these innovations, but doing it in an efficient way that drives significant value for shareholders. So we feel good about it Blayne.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Blayne. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Gary, I guess I had a longer-term question for you. So, we're going to see gate-all-around maybe late next year, but definitely in 2023. And then we go to FinFETs maybe in '24 or definitely '25 which seems like a long way away, but it's not really that far out there. And there seems to kind of be a broad view that litho is going to be a big headwind for the films companies like you. But it actually seems like the same thing could happen in logic that happened in NAND, where you start to stack transistors, so that you could capture the incremental dollars versus litho, if you look out say three to five years. So can you just kind of talk about what's happening in logic? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks for the question Tim. So, what I would say I meet these CEOs and R&D leaders for leading foundry and logic on a very regular basis, actually more often now than I did before the pandemic, because we're doing all of this virtual. I deeply believe -- and you can see even this week there was one of our leading customers talking about how they're driving their technology roadmaps going forward. And it's really around the five elements that we've been talking about; the new structures; new chip architectures; everybody is designing their own application specific chips; new materials; new ways to shrink. I've talked about packaging and the growth there, but I think we're just in a tremendous position. And when you think about what's going to drive power performance and cost going forward, there's no question it's about these new structures and these new materials. And when you look at really all of the different markets, you talked about the new transistor structures going forward whether -- people call gate-all-around or nano sheets, or also the wiring, the resistance in the wiring there's tremendous focus in those areas, because that is really what enables power and performance going forward. So we're just in a really tremendous position. When you think about the materials that are needed to create those nano sheets or the wiring or 3D DRAM, or any of those big inflections that are going forward in the future, we just have by far the best portfolio of materials that creates those structures. Then you think about shaping the structures. We have strength in conductor etch. We're -- we've certainly had a strong position in memory. We're growing in foundry/logic. You'll see our share continue to grow there. Shaping with the Selectra product is also really important for nano sheets and for other new structures, the modification of those different structures and also accelerating the time-to-market. I talked about the synergies with our PDC and especially our e-beam business. When I'm building this new transistor, if I can see the materials, residual materials inside that structure as I'm driving the R&D versus having to cross-section one particular transistor and look inside that their learning rates go up by orders of magnitude. So those unique imaging capabilities combined with the unique capabilities in creating and shaping and modifying those structures, again, I just -- if you look at what's being presented by our leading customers even this week, you'll see exactly aligns to this new playbook and enabling capabilities for Applied. So again I've never been more excited about our opportunities to enable the roadmap.
Timothy Arcuri: Totally, Gary. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious in your WFE outlook for this year, what's your assumption around domestic China? And does your WFE outlook for this year include the assumption that we don't see any license from customers that are required by the government right now?
Dan Durn: Yes. Hi, Joe, thanks for your question. So from a domestic China standpoint, we think we ended the year 2020 around $10 billion. We think we're up a few billion off of that level. So we'll see this year what we've been seeing for several years now, which is slow-steady ecosystem development. You're going to see some investment in technology roadmaps and still some pretty modest capacity additions that sit behind those technology roadmaps. And then from a licensing standpoint just given where we sit in the process, we think it's prudent to forecast and guide revenue and market sizing, assuming the licenses do not come through. And when we receive the licenses then we'll adjust the expectations. I would expect revenue to go up, and I would expect the market sizing to go up. But the current forecast expectations of greater than $70 billion this calendar year for the overall market size does not assume that those licenses come through. That will be upside to the numbers we've talked about.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Joe. And operator we have time for two more questions please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mitch Steves: Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. Obviously a very great quarter and great guide. My only little nitpick here, just on the display business, I feel like every quarter we kind of try to call a bottom here. But then, you made comments about all of the segments kind of being up, in the second-half. Can you maybe just help us understand, what the magnitude is at for the display business? And then secondly, if you've got, any sort of like actual visibility into that and confidence around display being up in the second-half of the year. Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Mitch. So a couple of things on display, I think we've been very consistent in this business overtime. We know that from quarter-to-quarter, this is a business that will bounce around a little bit. But we've been saying now for many quarters, that the sizing in 2021 from an overall market spend perspective, as well as the proportion of spend, in TV, in mobile, is going to look and feel a lot like 2020. And that's exactly what we see playing out. The implication for our business revenue and we've been saying this for many quarters now, the revenue that we see in our display business in fiscal 2021 is going to be very similar, to what we produced in fiscal 2020. And so I think that gives you the math. You know what we've done in fiscal Q1. You know what we just guided to in fiscal Q2. That gives you a sense of the step-up that we see in the back half of the year. And then, as we look forward into 2022, we are monitoring a number of green shoots. We talked about on the last earnings call our confidence interval around them continue to increase. And the confidence interval around 2022 being a robust investment point in the cycle continues to increase. So we feel good about where we stand, growing off of the guide we just gave in fiscal Q2. From an order standpoint, -- we can see it from an order standpoint, growth into the back half of the year. And we can also see it from a customer deposit perspective. And so we feel good about, how we're shaping expectations around this market. And I've got, no anxiety, given what we see and where we sit, around the second-half being stronger than the first-half in that business.
Michael Sullivan: Hey, thanks Mitch.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much and congrats on a nice finish, to the calendar year. Gary, maybe just to follow up on some of the questions and given the strength that you had in the advance packaging business that looks like it's another growth opportunity for you. Are you able to leverage the products from your, "leadership and existing portfolio?" Or are you also developing new products, given the changes that are going on in advance packaging, particularly as they become more front-end manufacturing-like?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question, Patrick. So I'd start off by saying, we've talked about this as being one of the five key drivers for the PPAC roadmap going forward. And if you look at, what leading customers are talking about packaging is incredibly important for power and performance and cost. So for me personally, I've engaged much more so with the R&D leaders in this particular industry than I ever was. Relative to your question about, existing products versus new products, I would say it's both. If you look at, wafer-level packaging we're number one, in wafer-level packaging, advanced wafer-level packaging with PVD, CVD, CMP plating. We have a new Sym3 via etcher, also where we won one of the largest -- one of our largest customers in that business. So we have all of those combinations of products in packaging. And we also announced recently a new integrated hybrid bonding system, working with another company that is really important. And we have very strong pull from every one of the -- our leading customers with that new technology. So again, it's a combination of both, where we're innovating with our existing products, also looking at accelerating the big inflections in packaging. And hybrid bonding is one example of that. So I think it's just a tremendous opportunity for the company. I think this is going to become more important as we go forward and we're in a unique position with the combinations of capabilities that we have.
Patrick Ho: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Patrick for your question. And Dan, would you like to help us wrap the call?
Dan Durn: Yes. Sure Mike. Thanks. So as I look at this quarter, a few things stand out for me. First, the growing strength of our end markets, second, really strong outperformance in calendar 2020 and I guess third, an even better setup for Applied, as we look forward into 2021. I see strength throughout the year. And that includes fiscal second-half growing across all three reporting segments: Semi Systems, AGS and display. I really like the gross margin improvement. It's been a lot of hard work, especially during COVID-19 and I really want to thank all of our teams one more time, for this great progress. We all hope that the regulatory decision on Kokusai goes in our favor. And Gary and I along with the rest of the management team look forward to seeing you in about six weeks, during the investor meeting. Mike, let's close the call now.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available on our website by 5:00 Pacific Time. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest, in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-11-12 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining Applied’s Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that today’s call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied’s most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today’s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today’s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. I am very pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered record revenue in our fourth fiscal quarter and earnings hit an annualized run-rate of $5 per share for the first time. For the fiscal year, we grew revenues 18% and earnings 37% while making significant, strategic investments in new technologies and products to address the industry’s highest value problems and position the company for sustained, long-term success. These results are all the more impressive considering the unprecedented disruptions we’ve navigated this year. I really want to thank all our employees, suppliers and partners for their resilience and adaptability. Our teams have switched to new ways of working, delivered on our commitments to customers and investors, and kept our technology and product development on track. While our actions to date are driven by a need to protect the health and safety of our employees while keeping our company strong, I am very excited about the long-term benefits of working in new ways, especially remote support and R&D. In today’s call, I’ll begin by sharing our current view of the market environment. Then, as this is the end of our fiscal year, I’ll highlight some of our major accomplishments in 2020, before describing the growth drivers and inflections that will shape our markets over the next several years. I’ll conclude by outlining our strategy and investments that will drive Applied’s long-term profitable growth. As we adapt to the challenges created by COVID-19 and prepare for the post-pandemic era, we are seeing fundamental changes in many areas of our lives and the world is depending on semiconductors more than ever. Investments in IT and communications infrastructure, combined with the accelerated digital transformation of companies and the economy as a whole, are driving very robust semiconductor and wafer fab equipment demand. In foundry-logic, we see leading-edge customers building out their fabs and aggressively driving advanced R&D. This gives us confidence that current investment levels are sustainable into 2021 and beyond. In addition, specialty markets underperformed in 2020 due to headwinds in industrial and automotive, and therefore represent an upside for 2021 as these sectors rebound. In memory, spending is growing faster than foundry-logic this year as customers push forward with their technology roadmaps. We see NAND outgrowing DRAM in 2020, and then DRAM growing significantly faster than NAND in 2021. Consistent with the perspective we shared on the August call, our outlook remains very positive. We are outperforming the market and we are demonstrating we can grow independent of the spending mix. This quarter, semiconductor systems revenues were an all-time – the mid-point of our guidance will be up another 12% next quarter. For the fiscal year, semi systems revenue grew 26%, with broad-based strength across products and device types. Our traditional leadership businesses that provide solutions for creating and modifying materials and structures are benefiting from innovations that enable leading-edge transistors and interconnects. For example, our metals deposition business technology that is critical to interconnect performance grew revenues 42% in fiscal 2020 to nearly $2.2 billion. In our businesses that focus on shaping and analyzing materials and structures, we have significant opportunities to grow our share and we’re demonstrating our strong momentum. In fiscal 2020, our etch business generated record revenues, growing nearly 30% year-on-year. We are gaining share in conductor etch as we win new applications in DRAM and foundry-logic. Our inspection business also delivered record performance, as systems revenues increased 46% for the year. We have significant traction with leading-edge customers and are winning share in optical wafer inspection and E-beam with new products that are still in early stages of adoption. As the benefits of traditional 2D Moore’s Law scaling slow down, leading companies are describing how the industry is transitioning to a new playbook to drive Performance, Power, Area-Cost and Time-to-Market of new devices. This PPACt playbook includes new architectures, new structures, new materials, new ways to shrink geometries and new packaging technology. Applied is uniquely positioned to accelerate this playbook. The breadth of our product portfolio is a key advantage because it allows us to combine technologies in innovative new ways. For example, in patterning where we generated nearly $1.1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020, we have been winning new applications across multiple customers with a new product that delivers a novel hard-mask material combined with a co-optimized etch solution to open the hard-mask. This is a great example of a new class of highly differentiated products we call Integrated Materials Solutions or IMS. We have numerous IMS engagements with our leading customers and I’m very excited about the IMS products we’ll be bringing to market in the next several years. Another area where we are creating value using our broad capabilities is advanced packaging that enables chips to be connected in new ways. Our packaging business is scaling, generating record revenues of half a billion dollars for the year, up over 20% from fiscal 2019. We are also expanding our eco-system footprint through a combination of organic investments and partnerships. Moving to service, AGS also delivered record revenues for the quarter and the year. The portion of AGS revenue generated from subscription-style business also grew to record levels. In fiscal 2020, we increased the number of tools covered by long-term service agreements by 13%. As a result, 60% of our service and spare parts business now comes from these stickier and more predictable recurring revenue streams. Our renewal rates for long-term agreements are also very high, at more than 90%. This illustrates the value customers see in our advanced service products. Rounding out our portfolio with Display, we hit our 2020 revenue target in a challenging market. Our outlook for 2021 is similar to this year with no significant changes to the view we shared in our last call. However, we are starting to see some encouraging leading indicators of future growth that we’ll be watching closely in 2021. These include increasing adoption of Organic LED displays OLED for IT applications, higher OLED adoption in the smartphone market with more than 70% of the 5G handsets launched to date equipped with OLED screens and foldable OLED handsets approaching a price point that could spur volume adoption. As I’ve said before, we are optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Applied in the display market as we focus on addressing the OLED inflection and expanding our available market. Finally, as I look back on our accomplishments this year, I am also very proud of our new 10-year roadmap for environmental and social responsibility that we announced over the summer. This roadmap lays out the detailed actions behind our vision to ‘Make Possible a Better Future’ for everyone. We’ve taken a holistic approach to these plans that considers our operations, how we work with customers and suppliers, and how our technology can be used to advance sustainability on a global scale. We call our framework 1x, 100x, 10,000x, and we’ve used it to rally the company around challenging new goals and commitments. Before I conclude, I’ll take a few minutes to describe the longer-term growth drivers we see for Applied. As I look ahead to the next decade, our opportunities have never been better. There are numerous, trillion-dollar inflections that can be enabled by advances in materials engineering, from next generation displays and AR/VR, to electrification of transport and personalized healthcare. However, the one inflection that really stands out is Al. Al has the potential to change everything and it will touch every major industry and area of the economy. Al also has major implications for the electronics and semiconductor eco-system: First, we are moving from an application-centric to a data-first world where almost all data will be generated and consumed by machines. This means that the industry’s growth will no longer be limited by humans’ ability to create or consume data. Second, the new computing approaches needed to make sense of the massive volumes of data available will work best with workload-specific hardware built from customized and entirely new types of silicon. This diversification of designs and devices is great for the industry. And third, training neural networks for Al computing is incredibly power intensive. So there is a huge imperative for the industry to drive improvements in the performance-per-watt of computing solutions. The advances in technology needed to unlock the potential of Al create tremendous opportunities for Applied Materials. We’ve aligned our strategy and investments around this vision for the future. And, we are uniquely positioned to accelerate the industry’s new PPACt playbook, to advance Power, Performance, Area-Cost and Time-to-market of next generation semi devices. Before hand the call over to Dan, let me quickly summarize. Despite the unprecedented challenges of 2020, Applied is delivering record performance. We are outperforming the market overall and have strong momentum in key growth areas like etch and inspection. The demand outlook for semiconductors remains very strong, driven by IT infrastructure, digital transformation of businesses, and an acceleration of longer-term technology trends, especially Al. Our future opportunities have never been better. We have been investing in next-generation technologies that are critical for the Al ecosystem and laying the groundwork for Applied’s future growth. Our strategy to accelerate the PPACt playbook is already yielding results for our customers and Applied. And, as look ahead, I’m very excited about the innovative new products and integrated solutions we will bring to market in 2021 and beyond. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. Today, I’ll add my perspective on our Q4 performance and full-year results. I’ll share some noteworthy developments in our installed base business and I’ll provide you with our backlog entering our next fiscal year along with our business outlook for Q1. Beginning with our Q4 performance, I’m pleased that our company delivered record revenue and earnings per share despite the ongoing challenges related to COVID. Our teams managed to significantly increase our system shipments and customer support and we did this in a very disciplined manner that resulted in higher operating profits and free cash flow. We’ve now shipped all of the unmet backlog from earlier in the year and our Q1 guidance gives you a direct look at the healthy demand trends we continue to see in our business. In Q4, we delivered revenue above the midpoint of our guidance across all of the segments, including record revenue in Semi Systems and AGS. We grew revenue by 25% versus the same period last year, increased non-GAAP operating profit by 49% year-on-year, and delivered record non-GAAP EPS of $1.25, which was up 56% year-over-year. We also increased operating cash flow to over $1.3 billion, up 59% year-over-year. About two months into our quarter, the U.S. government imposed a licensing requirement related to one of our foundry customers in China. This requirement reduced our revenue in Q4 and our guidance for Q1. We’ve already applied for licenses where needed to comply with the new rules. Turning to our full-year results, I’m especially pleased with the growth of our semiconductor-related businesses. Semi Systems and AGS combined grew by over 20%, year-over-year. Our installed base business, which includes AGS plus 300 millimeter upgrades, grew by over 9% year-on-year and continues to represent close to a third of Applied’s revenue. This growing part of our company provides an annuity-like revenue stream that makes us more resilient across market cycles. Within AGS, we’ve seen positive developments in our long-term service agreements. Until recently, the vast majority of our agreements had one-year terms, but in 2020, about a third of the agreements we signed had terms of at least three years. We’ve increased these extended service agreements by a factor of 10 over the past three years. This outstanding growth underscores the close working relationships we have with customers, who are using our data-enabled services over the life of a node to generate world-class yields, output and costs. In fact, in 2020, we grew the installed base of our data-enabled tools by nearly 40%. For the company as a whole in 2020, we delivered record revenue in both Semi Systems and AGS. We increased non-GAAP gross margin by 110 basis points, invested 69% of non-GAAP OpEx in research and development, grew non-GAAP operating profit by 32%, and increased EPS by 37%. We also generated $3.8 billion in operating cash flow setting a new record and returned $1.44 billion to shareholders. We raised the dividend for the third year in a row, paid dividends of $787 million, and allocated nearly $650 million to stock buybacks, repurchasing at an average price of $56.32. We increased cash on the balance sheet by nearly $2 billion as we prepared for the Kokusai Electric transaction. In Q4, our stock buybacks were limited to $50 million as our legal department imposed a trading blackout out of an abundance of caution in connection with our discussions with the Chinese regulatory agency that is reviewing the Kokusai Electric transaction. We continue to have constructive discussions and we’re working to secure clearance for the transaction before the end of the calendar year. Next I’ll share some color regarding the demand we see as we enter our new fiscal year. Applied’s backlog reached nearly $6.7 billion in Q4, setting a new year-end record. The combined backlog of our semi-related businesses also set a year-end record, growing to nearly $5.5 billion. Our Display backlog declined year-over-year and, as Gary discussed, we’re tracking the leading indicators of the eventual recovery. Now I’ll share our Q1 business outlook. We expect company revenue to be approximately $4.95 billion, plus or minus $200 million, with the midpoint up about 19%, year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $1.26 plus or minus $0.06, or up nearly 30%, year-over-year. Within this outlook, we project Semiconductor Systems revenue of around $3.45 billion, up nearly 23% year-over-year, AGS revenue of about $1.07 billion, up around 7% year-over-year, and Display revenue of around $400 million, up about 20% year-on-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 45.3%, which is higher year-over-year and lower sequentially due to near-term changes in product and customer mix. We expect Non-GAAP OpEx to increase to $860 million reflecting higher expenses from a 14-week quarter plus one month of annual merit increases partially offset by holiday shut-down savings. Our Q1 guidance assumes a tax rate of around 12% and a weighted average share count of around 925 million. In summary, I’m pleased that Applied delivered record performance in Q4 and has strong momentum entering our new fiscal year. Our backlog is at record levels as our products and technology generate strong customer pull. Our installed base business is becoming larger and more resilient with growth in our data-enabled services and multiyear service agreements. I’m incredibly proud of our teams for supporting our customers under challenging global circumstances while delivering record earnings and increased cash flow to our shareholders. Now Mike, let’s begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. Now to help us reach as many of you as we can. Please ask just one question and not more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let’s please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your question please.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, my first question, if I look at your DRAM business and make assumptions around your January quarter, it looks like you’re going to grow about mid-30% for DRAM. And that’s far better than what we’re seeing industry-wide. So I guess, can you discuss what’s driving that outperformance including some discussion on your success with conductor etch? And how should we think about your share of wallet for DRAM given that that’s probably the fastest growing sub segment in calendar 2021?
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks C.J. I’ll take the question. As you pointed out, our DRAM business is showing significant signs of strength this year. We’ve built momentum throughout the year and we expect to close the year very strong. As we think about the overall growth rate of the DRAM market in this year against the backdrop of an industry that’s probably growing 10% to 15% probably at the high end of that range for overall WFE. Our overall systems business is going to be up over 25% for the calendar year against that DRAM as a market is probably a couple of points higher than the overall industry. So based on the math you walked through, you can see that the company is significantly outperforming. On last quarter’s call, Gary talked about the momentum we’re seeing from a conductor etch standpoint. So the team is performing really, really well there. And then as you think about, things like high-k metal gate to get the IO speeds on and off the DRAM device we’ve been talking for a while about that inflection coming into the market, and we’re just really well positioned from a technology standpoint to drive our customers’ roadmaps and seeing strong adoption. So we feel really good about how we’re performing against the backdrop of a good market. But clearly, strong performance and we’re really encouraged by what we see going forward and we would expect this strength to continue in the next year as we continue to push our customers’ roadmap and drive strong adoption of the technology.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, maybe C.J., just add a little bit more color. This is Gary. For high speed, the periphery is moving to more like as Dan said more logic-like processes, where that’s in the sweet spot of where we have leadership with a number of different products. So that’s part of a unique inflection, that’s really fueling our growth in DRAM. And I talked, I think in the last earnings call about the growth that we’ve seen in our DRAM conductor etch, gaining about 30 points of share since 2016. And so with the key technology inflections for the high-speed memory and also the strength of the Sym3 and etch, really that’s fueling our growth, and we feel really good that we’re going to continue to enable the future inflections and continue to grow – outgrow the market in DRAM.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And as my follow-up, I guess, perhaps if you could focus on domestic China and overall China, I think the concern out there is that the types of numbers we’re seeing is not sustainable, particularly given what’s going on with SMIC. But curious if you could offer thoughts on the greater breadth of spending that we’ll probably see in calendar 2021 and then how we should think about multinationals layering in and what impact that will have on overall CapEx coming out of China? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes, sure C.J. Let me jump in on that and see if Gary wants to add anything at the end. From an overall market standpoint in calendar year 2020, we see meaningful spend by both the domestic customers as well as the multinational customers. And if I were to think about weighting of that spend, I would say it favors the domestic market over the multinationals. But both groups of customers are having meaningful spend. I think what you see is a broad-base of investments. You’re seeing investments across 200 millimeter geometries, 300 millimeter geometries, and within 300 millimeter geometries, you’re seeing investments in NAND, DRAM, foundry, logic. So all device types. We think that continues into 2021. We probably won’t see the growth rates that we did in 2020. It’s going to be a strong year, but you certainly won’t see those growth rates. From a growth standpoint, I would expect multinationals to show more growth than the domestic customers, but still strong spend in both categories. So we see, it’s a good market. We continue to see strength in China and expect to see that for the foreseeable future as they build their ecosystem in a slow disciplined manner.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks C.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Just to follow-up on C.J’s question on China, Dan. You talked about it in your prepared comments that the ruling against SMIC did impact your fiscal fourth quarter, fiscal first quarter. Wonder if you can just confirm with us how much of an impact was it? And does SMIC now represent zero within the forward-looking numbers or how are we thinking about kind of the impact there?
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks, John. Here is what I can share with you. As you can imagine, we probably don’t want to be too detailed on what any one customer is doing, but the licensing requirement that we talked about, it was put in place about two-thirds of the way through our fiscal fourth quarter. So we saw about four or five weeks exposure to that new requirement. As we said in the prepared comments, Q4 revenue and Q1 guidance would have been higher if those restrictions had not been in place. So we’re complying with the new rules. We’ve already applied for licenses where we need them. Trade situation remains fluid. So we don’t want to speculate about the future. But certainly the revenue in Q4 and guide for Q1 would have been higher, absent that requirement. As you know, we’ve been in China for a very long time. We’ve got a broad-base of relationships and it’s across all device types and we would expect the China market to continue to be strong for us going forward. And again, we’re working with governments to get the licensing requirement satisfied.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up for Gary. Gary, a lot of the conversation around U.S.-China trade tension. There had been concerns around restriction of shipping equipment into China. But there’s clearly a second side of the story where a lot of countries now are looking at the strategic necessity for semiconductor capacity. You have things like the CHIPS Act in the U.S., you have TSMC announcing a foundry in Arizona earlier this year. EU officials have been talking about perhaps incentivizing more domestic production, in Japan, the same. So I’m just kind of curious, given your vantage point in the industry, how important of a trend do you think this will be, this idea of regionalization of semi capacity? And what kind of potential growth driver, could it be for your business?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question, John. So first-off, I would say that really the major focus for all our customers is to drive their roadmaps, deliver the lowest power, highest performance chips at the best cost. And I deeply believe that the future roadmap is going to look very different than the past. I’ve talked before about classic Moore’s Law and 2D scaling, not being enough to enable the future AI infrastructure at the edge and in the cloud. So I do believe, kind of aligned with your question, that this is highly strategic for many countries and many regions, and I do — we do see that certainly, we see some near-term trends with big customers moving to new regions in alignment with that trend, and I think that that’s going to continue. So it definitely creates an opportunity for Applied going forward, certainly as these customers are moving to new regions, the support in terms of accelerating their R&D, the ramp, transfer of technologies into these new regions, all of that creates a great service opportunity for us. And then even more important, as I said, I do believe the future is going to look different than the past. We’re at an inflection point in the industry relative to how you drive the technology forward. One of our biggest customers two months ago, talked about their roadmap beyond 2020 to double energy efficient computing every two years. And if you go look at the slide two months ago, it exactly aligns what I’ve been talking about with the five elements of the playbook around new architectures, new materials, new structures, new ways to shrink and new ways to connect chips together with advanced packaging. So exactly what we’ve been talking about and Applied is in a really great position with innovative products and integrated solutions to enable that new PPACt playbook. So I think we’ve never been in a better position. And again, I do believe that the industry is at an inflection point and the countries and the companies that are best aligned to this new playbook and get there first are going to win. It’s very, very important for the whole AI infrastructure going forward.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you. John.
John Pitzer: Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Toshiya Hari: Hi guys. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Gary, my first question is on Inspection. I think in your prepared remarks you talked about your business being up 46%. I think it was your systems business was up 46% in fiscal 2020. You probably outperformed most of your peers, if not all your peers during that timeframe. Where are you seeing the most traction in Inspection and how should we think about sustainability for that business into 2021? And I’ve got a quick follow-up.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks Toshiya for the question. So absolutely the Inspection business is a real bright spot for the company. And as you mentioned we grew the systems revenue by 46%. We have a new optical inspection system and new e-beam products that are seeing strong initial adoption with leading customers. And in both areas, we have a lot of room to grow and we’ll make an official launch fairly soon on some of these new capabilities. And the other thing I would say, certainly the – in this business, we have some really, really great leading technology. And the other aspect, that’s important for Applied is the connection in driving the PPACt roadmap. The analysis of all of these new innovations, when you think about wiring to lower resistance to improve the power or gate all around for high performance transistors, having these unique imaging capabilities and we have launched a product that has dramatically higher resolution than any product – e-beam product that’s on the market today. Being able to see those data all around structures and understand how to drive the different films in shaping the structures and modifying the structures, all of that tied together is also tremendously synergistic with the rest of our business in driving the PPACt roadmap. So we’re really in the early adoption of some of these new capabilities. I’m very confident that 2021 and beyond, we’re going to have really good results from our PDC business, but also I’m really excited about the connectivity to the rest of Applied’s business in accelerating the PPACt roadmap for customers.
Toshiya Hari: Great, thanks for that Gary. And then Dan, as my follow-up, just on gross margin, I know there are multiple sort of levers both to the upside and the downside that could impact gross margins, and you guided to a slightly lower number for fiscal Q1. But when you think about gross margins longer term, I think at your most recent Analyst Day, you put up a 47% number, if I recall correctly, but is that still sort of the right target for you internally or is it higher, lower, how should we think about gross margins on a multi-year cadence? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks Toshiya. Hi. So from a gross margin standpoint, the company is performing really well. If you think about what Gary said in the prepared comments, in fiscal year 2020, we’re up 110 basis points year-over-year. Our fiscal Q4 we just reported we’re up 190 basis points year-over-year. And then like you pointed out, we see some different mix as we look into our fiscal Q1. It’s down a little bit sequentially, but still up year-over-year. We think that’s a little temporary and that mix is going to reverse itself as we look out into the fiscal Q2. So we think the company is executing well on a difficult environment. When we think about the long-term gross margin, I think the best way to describe it would be 45% plus or minus 2 points depending on where we are in the cycle. And if you look at the quarter we just printed 45.7% and then you factor in some of the headwinds we’re experiencing in the current environment due to COVID and the pandemic, we would be at the upper end of that range we referenced of 45% plus or minus 2 points. So I think that model that framework around gross margin holds and the company is performing well to that as the legacy impacts and the headwinds from the pandemic begin to wane, I think you would see the performance in the current environment reflecting that framework around long-term gross margin.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question please.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Gary, you made an interesting comment in your prepared remarks that you guys can grow independent of the mix, which is an important distinction from some of your peers, which are more leveraged towards memory or logic. And you talked about the outperformance in Etch and Inspection markets. Looking into next year where you are most excited about Etch or Inspection or different market?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question. So I would say, if I look at what am I most excited about, it’s what I talked about earlier. That I really believe that the industry has had an important inflection point, and you can see this also many leading customers and companies in ecosystem aligning around our view that classic Moore’s Law and 2D scaling is not going to be able to enable the future AI infrastructure at the edge and in the cloud. And you see this playing out in terms of the marketplace from a competitive standpoint, the companies that deliver lower power higher performance at the best cost faster than others, that’s the fundamental driver of all of our customers and the ecosystem. So Applied is in a great position to outperform, because we have many unique technologies and combination of products that are used to create, shape, modify, analyze and connect structures and devices. So I think I talked on the last call about our performance in some of our deposition businesses. Last year, we gained 8 points of combined share and epi, PVD, CVD amounting to about $5.2 billion. This year, we grew our metals deposition business 42% to $2.2 billion. So these leadership businesses are very key to enabling next generation transistor and wiring, materials and structures and combined with other unique capabilities. I’m really optimistic about our opportunities as we go forward to drive the PPAC roadmap. And as you mentioned etch, we’re also performing very well in etch, significant growth in this last year. We’ve expanded beyond our strength in memory to foundry and logic, where we’re winning stats, we’re winning EUV stats as customers are moving to future technology nodes, and really, really, really great performance there. That’s really based on our new Sym3 platform, probably the best platform in the history of Applied Materials. And there are real fundamental advantages. One is conductance. Conductance is where you remove the etch materials from the chamber. So you’re not re-depositing on these structures and causing yield and performance issues, also particles that are deposited on the chamber. So that’s just a fundamental advantage of that particular technology. Also I’m on the phone, often with R&D leaders last night with one of the – our top logic customers, and we are seeing yield benefits with the Sym3 or they are seeing yield benefits with the Sym3, with new coatings that we’ve enabled on that platform that again is giving us better particle performance. So etch again very, very good momentum and I talked already about Inspection and we are in the early phases of adoption of some new products. I’m also very optimistic about that business as we go forward. But the really key thing that I’m most excited about as I do believe the industry is at inflection point, the future is not classic Moore’s Law or 2D scaling, and you look at what I talked about relative to creating and modifying and analyzing, connecting all of the structures and devices, we’re really in a unique position. So again, we are doing really well in different environments from a mix perspective, and I believe that we’re at the foundation of enabling the technologies for this future AI infrastructure.
Atif Malik: Great. And as my follow-up Dan, domestic China WFE is still in that $9 billion to $10 billion range for this year?
Dan Durn: Yes, that’s correct. Our view on that hasn’t changed. We’ve been pretty consistent on that over time. It’s going to be in that $9 billion to $10 billion range.
Atif Malik: Thank you.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Atif.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Your question please.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one for Dan. Dan, are you still targeting the December end close for the Kokusai acquisition or can it be delayed further? And along the same path, any kind of buyback increase, is it really tied to the outcome of what happens at Kokusai and then I had a follow-up for Gary.
Dan Durn: Sure, thanks, Krish. So, as you know we’ve gotten five of the six regulatory authorities to approve the transaction. We’re constructively engaged with the remaining authority and we continue to be optimistic that we’re going to receive clearance by the end of the calendar year. So we’ll stay focused on that. From a buyback standpoint, once we close the transaction, integrate the asset, I think we’ll come back to the investment community and put forward a combined company model over the next several years to give investors a perspective of how the combined company will perform. As part of that communication, we’ll talk about what our capital allocation strategy going forward is, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s what we’ve been doing now for quite some time, which is very shareholder friendly in terms of giving all excess cash back to shareholders and big buyers of our stock, given what we see happening from an overall market standpoint, the structural growth we see and the execution of this company against that opportunity. We see our industry going structurally larger, higher highs, higher lows. And we think there’s a real opportunity to put capital of the work from a share repurchase standpoint. So we’ll probably continue what we’ve been doing now for many years, but we’ll have that conversation once we get the investment community together post close of the transaction.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Dan. And then a longer term question for Gary. Gary, on China, I’m not looking at this from a political angle, from a – but from a long-term business and philosophical standpoint, do you think it’s good business practice for AMAT or other U.S. semi caps to ship to China, because on one side is balancing the needs of your customers, but also on the flip side, it might enable local competition or reverse engineering or how do you protect your IP. So I’m kind of curious how do you balance those two as China gets bigger?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question. Local competition has been a factor for us for many, many years in many different regions. And I just keep coming back to the leading companies want to work with the most innovative technologies and products and there’s just no way to go forward with the technology roadmaps, if you don’t have the combinations of those different technologies. And as I’ve said before, I just deeply believe that the future doesn’t look like the past. I don’t believe that the following the classic 2D Moore’s Law playbook is the path forward for the industry or to enable to this AI infrastructure. So I – there’s going to be tremendous innovation. I mentioned earlier, one of the – one of our leading customers two months ago, if you look at their Architecture Day, and they talked about the road forward beyond 2020 for energy efficient computing to double every two years. And it was exactly aligned with the things that I’ve been talking about over the last two years with the new architectures, new structures, new materials, EUV enhancements and new ways to connect the chips together with 3D advanced packaging. So I just believe there’s going to be tremendous innovation. All of this is going to be a moving target relative to the products. And the other thing is you have the opportunity to connect these products and technologies together in unique ways to manage the interfaces and the interfaces on these structures are becoming much more critical than they’ve ever been in the past. So we know we’ve talked about some innovations in the transistor, where we can enable enormous improvements in leakage current or drive current and it really comes from being able to combine these technologies together, not oxidized or damage those interfaces. Those are completely unique capabilities that you really having this portfolio is a tremendous advantage at a very unique advantage for Applied. So I think that the world will operate the best certainly with fair and free trade and that these inflections that we’re seeing today around AI, biggest inflections of our lifetimes will transform every industry and Applied is right at the foundation of those inflections.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Krish.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. I had two. I guess, Gary, first, I know you think about capital intensity a lot and I’ve seen your charts and I totally agree with the 10.5% to 11% longer-term WFE intensity. And it seems like if you strip out some of the duplicative spending today, there’s probably at least $3 billion to $4 billion in China that’s not backed by revenue. So it seems like if you strip that out, we’re probably closer to like 12% right now. So I know when you think longer-term, you do a lot of modeling about longer-term WFE. But when you kind of think about where WFE can go, and you build out a underlying semiconductor revenue number, is it fair to use like a 12% sort of a real or a core WFE intensity number. And then you can layer on top of that spending that you think might happen because of issues that John had mentioned before, but that’s not real dollars that’s backed by revenue. So the question is, is that 12% a good number?
Dan Durn: Hi, Tim, this is Dan, I’ll jump in on this one. So I do think 12% is a good number to start with. So I think there is a upward bias on that over time, given what we see from a technology roadmap standpoint. Yes, I think you can make that argument, but I think 12% is a good number to lock-in on. Just a couple of more perspectives on it. We talked about when 300 millimeter came in around the 2000 timeframe, we saw multiple concurrent investments in both wafer size technologies and we saw probably 17%. So that’s probably an all-time high. And what you saw is the 300 millimeter wafer size technology came into the industry and all of the efficiency gains that came with it as well as the consolidation of our customer base, we hit a low point in 2013 at about 9%, and it’s been on a steady upward trajectory since then. And so we think the trend is a pretty good one. The other thing I would point you to, and maybe this is a little bit of a different way of thinking about the industry. If you take that low point of capital intensity and you combine 2012 and 2013 as a combined two-year window, and then compare it to the next two-year combined window of 2013 and 2014, compare that for the next two year window of 2014 and 2015, and onwards when you do that exercise out 2021 and what you’ll see is each successive two-year windows within upwardly sloping line. And so we think our industry has gone from no growth cyclical to growth with a upward sloping trend line. And we will see higher highs and higher lows as that thesis plays out. And so we feel really good about where this industry is going and support of all the thematic trends that Gary has talked about for many quarters now.
Timothy Arcuri: Yes, yes, got it, Dan, thanks. And then I guess my second question is just on DRAM, I know, Gary, you sort of emphasized the DRAM is going to outgrow NAND on a percentage basis next year, which I guess sounds a little ominous for DRAM, but can you put that in the context of demand. It seems like DRAM WFE is certainly coming off of a much lower base this year and on the supply side, we’re in a far better point right now than we are in NAND. So can you sort of back those numbers into what that means for the supply demand balance packaging? Thanks.
Dan Durn: Yes, sure. Tim. I’ll jump in on that one again. And I think the best way to get at this and unpack it for the investment community is talk about what we see in 2020, and then use that as a jumping-off point to describe the contours around 2021. So starting with 2020, we continue to see the overall market up 10% to 15%. We’re probably at the high end of that range. We talked about Applied systems business against the market, that’s up 15%. Our systems business is going to be up 25% for the calendar year. By device type, we see foundry, logic greater than 55% in 2020, but it’s growing below the market average. DRAM in the memory side of the house, DRAM it’s growing a little faster than the overall market. I think the real story in 2020 is NAND. NAND is growing 2x the overall market in 2020. And so I think that’s maybe a little contrary to what the conventional thinking is around 2020. 2020 is a memory growth year especially for NAND. And against that backdrop of the memory growth year, Applied is outperforming very nicely. So we feel good about 2020. As we look into 2021, we expect another strong year for the industry and for Applied. And while we’re not sharing specific forecast around WFE, I think it’s premature to be point specific at this time. We see foundry, logic is going to continue to be strong and we see it is over 55% of total WFE again next year. But what you’ll see in the memory side of the house is going to be a reversal from a growth standpoint. NAND we expect to be flattish year-over-year and DRAM set up to significantly outgrow the market. So this is a great set up for Applied given the strong share gains we’ve been talking about now throughout 2020 in DRAM. It gives us confidence as we look into 2021 that the set up from an overall end market standpoint, strong foundry, logic, flattish NAND, strong DRAM is a good set up for Applied as we look into next year.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot, Dan.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. On your commentary on leading edge systems driving much of the incremental revenue growth this year with lagging edge system shipments muted, just given the weakness in auto industrial and analog segments of the market, the recovery in these markets, we’re seeing now and into next year should be a tailwind for the business. And so, what’s your expectation on the mix of leading edge versus lagging edge over the next few years, just given the number of new 12-inch analog fabs and microcontroller content and analog content growth in all-electronic applications? And what’s your positioning in these segments of the market?
Dan Durn: Hi Harlan, I’ll jump in on that one. I think you pointed out, rightfully. This is a little bit of a weaker market for the trailing no geometries. A couple of quarters ago or even last quarter we talked about auto and industrial market showing some signs of weakness as a result of the pandemic. Since then we’ve seen those end markets continuing to perform stronger. But I think it’s going to follow the natural progression we would see in any one of our end markets off of low utilization levels, we see utilization rise. Once utilization gets to a certain level, then you’ll see customers begin to layer in capacity. And so I would expect to see legs up in those markets, trailing no geometries as we look into next year. Longer-term, we think the trailing no geometries as a result of Communications Infrastructure, Industrial Auto, Internet of Things, there is a whole host of drivers that are taking that industry structurally larger over time. And we would expect that trailing no geometry segment to outgrow the overall market over a multi-year window. So we feel good about it. In the near term, while customers are pulling really hard multiple customers, multiple nodes, on the leading edge, you’ve seen a rotation from a very balanced foundry, logic market between leading edge and trailing node to probably more weighted to leading-edge technologies in the current environment. Over time, we would expect that to moderate a bit and get back to a more balanced profile than what we’ve seen maybe in 2020 or 2021. But we do think that those markets are set up to do well and we’re encouraged by that, because anytime you broaden the growth drivers of an industry, it just makes it structurally stronger, less cyclical, less volatile and we think that that’s going to benefit this industry significantly. From a positioning standpoint, we’re well-positioned competitively across that entire node profile. And so we’re going to continue to deliver enabling technology to the market and we continue to see strong pull from customers top to bottom across the new profiles.
Harlan Sur: Thanks for the insights there. And then as the industry moves towards more innovative and complex packaging technologies, multi-chip modules, chip-let strategy or actually in some cases even seen the return of [indiscernible] integration. I’m pleasantly surprised by the size of Applied’s advanced packaging business, $500 million in revenues this year. How big is this markets do you estimate and what type of growth outlook do you guys see for this emerging segment of the business?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question. So as I mentioned before, the packaging part of the ecosystem is one of the key drivers. There are the five drivers that I talked about before and then you see this being also discussed by many leading companies, our customers, other companies in the ecosystem fabless companies relative to the importance of packaging. I definitely think if you look at the power performance and costs going forward, packaging is really, really, really important, and we have a very strong position. We are number one in advanced wafer-level packaging. And we’re working with a number of different ecosystem partners. We talked about a partner with another company to deliver the first – industry’s first fully integrated solution for hybrid bonding, where you can connect two chips together in die form and that enables shorter interconnect distance 4x increase in IO density. So there is a lot of innovation that’s going to happen in that market. And we have very, very strong positions. If you look at just that one particular innovation, you need to optimize etch CMP deposition wafer surface cleaning, we have metrology inspection defect particle control that we can add to enable that inflection. And then we also had the Center of Excellence at Applied’s advanced packaging technology center in Singapore and we have some very large leading customers working with us on some of these new innovative architecture. So I’m really excited. Certainly it’s a meaningful part of our business today, but I think we’re really at the early phase of the adoption of many of these new technologies. And we are number one in advanced packaging, expanding with partnerships through the ecosystem. So I’m excited about it. I don’t want to give a specific number right now, but I think it’s going to become much more important than most people realize in the ecosystem.
Harlan Sur: Yes, thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Harlan. And operator, we have time for two more questions, please.
Operator: Certainly. Then our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham. Your question please.
Quinn Bolton: Hey guys, congratulations on the nice results and outlook. Just not to take anything away from what you’ve achieved this year in the foundry, logic and DRAM segments, but if I look at your NAND revenue at least in fiscal 2020, revenue was roughly flat year-on-year where it sounds like the overall NAND WFE may be up close to 30%. So it looks like you’ve lost share this year. Wondering as you look forward, are there opportunities to stem that share loss in fiscal 2021 or does your outperformance really depend on continued strength in DRAM and foundry, logic? Thanks.
Dan Durn: Yes, hi, Quinn. I think you might be drawing the wrong conclusion. When we talk about the WFE end market and we talk about NAND that’s a calendar year comment. And so if you look at the first three quarters of calendar year 2020, you see our NAND business up significantly more than the flat, you referenced. And at the midpoint of our guide, we won’t talk about by device type, but I think you’ll see the performance of that business, roughly in line with the overall market. It just the peculiarities of quarters when they happen to hit, and the revenue expectations within those quarters. And so if you look at the quarterly profile for the trailing 12 months, you will see that the one quarter out there from a historical standpoint was quite large showing performance this year on a fiscal year basis flattish. The first three quarters of 2020, you see a very different number. And when we’re talking three months from now at next quarter’s results, I think you’ll see a business that’s more roughly in line with the overall market. So we’re very comfortable, confident with how we’re positioned within that end market and we’re going to continue to drive our business in technology and look to do better over time.
Quinn Bolton: Great, thanks for that.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question then comes from Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question please.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I was curious on your prepared remarks you talked about a long-term service agreements now one-third of those being over three years. When you look at your current kind of book of contracts for your installed base, how do you think about that trending over the next few quarters?
Dan Durn: So, hi, Joe, this has been playing out over a multi-year period. If we go back in time, one point 30% of our revenue was generated from long-term service agreements, then we grew it to 40%, than 50%, now, you see at it 60%. I think we’ve got the right strategy around this business. You see those long-term service agreements, extending out in 10-year, which provides even more stability and we’re going to look to drive that number north off of the 60% of revenues over time. We’re going to look to continue to drive that number north. So we’ll take it one quarter at a time, one year at a time and continue to execute against our strategy, but we see more headroom against that number and look to push this business forward in a much more stable growth oriented way.
Michael Sullivan: Hey, thanks, Joe for your question. And Dan, would you like to help us close out the call today.
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks, Mike. I’m really pleased that in a year we’re all going to remember for its extraordinary challenges. Applied delivered record revenue, earnings, operating cash flow, year-end backlog. And I would like to sincerely thank our employees and partners for everything they did to support our customers in that difficult environment. Looking into next year, just a few quick thoughts to leave you with. I think the growth opportunities for the semiconductor industry are bigger than ever. The industry roadmap is clearly moving towards our new playbook and our balanced market exposure lets us perform well regardless of the spending mix. Our installed base business is growing and making us more resilient across the cycles and I’m encouraged by the early green shoots we’re seeing in Display. Gary and I look forward to seeing many of you at the Credit Suisse Conference next month and until then I hope you all enjoy a happy and safe Thanksgiving. Take care.
Michael Sullivan: All right, thank you very much. That concludes our conference call and thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participant lines will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Good afternoon and thank you for joining Applied's third quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings presentation materials, which are all available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. This time last quarter, I started the call by outlining the steps we were taking inside of Applied Materials to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Our actions have been guided by two key principles: first, maintaining the trust of our employees, customers, suppliers, and partners; and second, focusing on strategic initiatives that will allow us to emerge stronger over the longer term. Today, I'm pleased to report that both our manufacturing operations and R&D labs are running smoothly at pre-COVID levels of productivity. I'd like to acknowledge the exceptional contributions, resilience, and creativity of our employees and suppliers, who have rapidly adapted to new ways of working to deliver this quarter's outstanding results. A few weeks ago at SEMICON West, I outlined Applied's vision for the next decade. I talked about the critical role semiconductors will play in shaping a better future for everyone, the advances in technology needed to unlock the potential of artificial intelligence, and how materials engineering will enable the industry's new PPACt playbook to advance power, performance, area/cost, and time to market. I also announced Applied's new 10-year goals and roadmap for environmental sustainability, which is part of our commitment to grow our business responsibly and make possible a better future. Having covered our long-term perspective in detail at that event, today I'm going to focus my comments on current market dynamics and provide additional insights into our product portfolio and business momentum. Starting with the market environment, we remain mindful of global economic concerns and that consumer spending is a potential headwind for many sectors, including the electronics industry. With that said, demand for semiconductors has strengthened over recent months. As the world adapts to the challenges created by the pandemic, several major technology inflections are being accelerated. Work-from-home, homeschooling, and online retail are driving investments in cloud data centers and communications infrastructure. Many organizations are building stronger business continuity plans and increasing the use of automation and IoT technologies. And because AI has the potential to transform entire industries, its adoption remains non-discretionary for many companies. In wafer fab equipment, we expect overall foundry/logic spending to grow this year, even with soft demand in specialty nodes that serve automotive and industrial markets. At the leading edge, we see a strong commitment from customers to build out their fabs and aggressively drive their R&D roadmaps. This gives us confidence these levels of spending are sustainable in 2021 and beyond. As I've described before, with the slowing of traditional 2D Moore's Law scaling, there will be a transition from general purpose computing to customized solutions tailored for specific applications or workloads. Recent announcements by leading systems companies illustrate this inflection very well. Custom designed silicon and diversification of architectures play to the strengths of the foundries and underpin their ongoing investments. In memory, we see investments for the year growing slightly faster than in foundry/logic, as customers push forward with their technology roadmaps. We also see the growth rate in DRAM being very similar to NAND. Against this backdrop of a strengthening demand, our semiconductor systems revenues are up 18% on a trailing 12-month basis, and at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance will be up 25% for our fiscal year. Next, I'll explain what's driving our outperformance today and how, by focusing on our customers' highest value problems, we are positioned to grow faster than our markets over the next several years. The process complexity required to produce leading-edge transistors and interconnects continues to grow, and new innovations in materials and structures are fundamental to driving higher performance and lower power consumption. This plays directly to the strengths of Applied's traditional leadership areas, namely, creating and modifying materials and structures. For example, our deposition businesses, CVD, PVD, and Epi, generated more than $5.2 billion of revenue in calendar 2019, and according to VLSI's data, gained 8 points of market share. In our growth businesses that focus on shaping and analyzing materials and structures, we have strong momentum. We are the fastest-growing company in etch, even though we don't currently serve the dielectric market segment. At the midpoint of our guidance, our etch revenues will be up nearly 30% this fiscal year. Since we introduced our Sym3 system in 2015, we have shipped more than 5,000 chambers, and we recently introduced Sym3 Y, which is the most advanced etch system we've ever built. This system provides extremely high material selectivity as well as precise depth and profile control needed to form the densely packed high-aspect ratio structures in next-generation 3D, NAND, DRAM, and logic devices. We're also the fastest growing company in the metrology and inspection market. At the midpoint of our guidance, revenue for our Process Diagnostics and Control business will be up more than 40% in fiscal 2020. We're winning share in optical wafer inspection and e-beam, with new products that are in the early stages of adoption and have significant traction with leading customers. Applied has by far the broadest product portfolio in the industry, spanning materials creation, modification, shaping, analysis, and packaging. This allows us to see inflections early and develop more complete solutions for customers, from co-optimizing deposition and removal processes all the way to our integrated materials solutions that combine multiple process and metrology technologies within a single system to address our customers' most complex challenges. In addition, our business is very well balanced across device segments. In foundry, where we are traditionally very strong, we are seeing our available market grow node over node, and we are positioned to outperform the market as these new technologies ramp in high-volume manufacturing. In DRAM, our share is even higher than in foundry/logic. Over the past five years, we've gained 25 points of DRAM patterning share and still have significant potential to grow. We've recently won multiple process tool-of-record positions for future node transitions, including multi-patterning, hard mask, and hard mask open applications. In addition, the industry's upcoming transition to high-speed DDR5 is enabled by advanced logic-like features, including high-k/metal gate. This grows the available market in areas where Applied has clear technology leadership. Another area where we're delivering more value to customers and have strong growth momentum is our aftermarket businesses. If we look at Applied Global Services' plus 300-millimeter upgrades, revenues are up 21% compared to the same period in 2019. Within AGS, 60% of our service and spare parts business comes from predictable recurring revenue streams in the form of long-term service agreements. This year, the renewal rate for these long-term agreements is in excess of 90%, which is clear validation of the value customers see in our advanced service products. In display, our revenue outlook for fiscal 2020 is unchanged at $1.6 billion, and we expect 2021 to be similar. However, we're seeing some encouraging signs on the high end of the market, specifically robust demand for 8K screens and the adoption of OLED in TVs. We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Applied in the display market, as we focus on addressing future technology inflections and expanding our available market. Finally, I'll highlight how we're working differently inside the company as well as with our customers and suppliers. COVID-19 restrictions have stimulated many changes in the way companies in the industry are operating. For example, since March, we've provided thousands of digital support sessions using AR and video, held more than 900 training sessions with field support engineers using VR and live distance learning, and fully restored R&D lab productivity while bringing only a fraction of our engineering staff onsite. I strongly believe that Innovate Anywhere provides substantial long-term benefits by eliminating waste, saving time and money, and reducing the industry's carbon footprint. Over the past several years, Applied has been making significant investments in state-of-the-art digital infrastructure, sensors and metrology, data science, machine learning, and simulation. The combination of these technologies enables us to accelerate product development cycles, speed up transfer of new technologies from lab to fab, and optimize cost, output, and yield for our customers in high-volume production. Before I hand the call over to Dan, I will quickly summarize. First, thanks to the extraordinary hard work of our employees and suppliers, we are operating the company at pre-COVID levels of productivity while maintaining stringent protocols to keep our workplaces safe and healthy. Second, while we're mindful of potential macroeconomic headwinds, semiconductor equipment demand is strengthening, and the longer-term industry growth drivers remain firmly in place. Based on what we hear from our customers, we believe current spending levels will be sustained or even higher in 2021. Third, our strategy to accelerate the PPACt playbook is yielding results for our customers and Applied. Today, we're outperforming the market overall and especially in key growth areas, including etch and inspection. Looking ahead, I am very excited about the innovative new products and integrated solutions we will bring to market this year and beyond. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan.
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Gary. Today I'll summarize our Q3 results, give you more insights into the performance trends Gary outlined, and share our business outlook for Q4. I'm pleased that, despite challenges related to COVID-19, our teams delivered double-digit year-over-year revenue growth across semiconductor systems, AGS, and display. Our install base business, which includes AGS plus 300-millimeter upgrades, grew by 11% sequentially and 21% year over year, and now represents about a third of our company's total revenue. For the company as a whole, we grew revenue by 23% year over year and generated non-GAAP earnings of $1.06, up 43% year on year. We anticipate continued momentum in our fiscal Q4 and Q1. During the third quarter, we shipped a significant proportion of the backlog that we couldn't satisfy in Q2 due to COVID-related supply chain disruptions. Our demand has remained strong, and our Q3 ending backlog was nearly unchanged from the prior quarter. The industry's supply chain performance continues to improve. And despite ongoing logistical challenges in Q3, we increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 40 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year on year. We also delivered sequential operating margin gains in both semiconductor systems and AGS. Non-GAAP OpEx was in line with our targets, and we allocated 69% to research and development. We increased non-GAAP operating profit to $1.16 billion, up 41% year over year. In May, we successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior notes at historically low rates and later redeemed $1.35 billion of maturities that were due in October 2020 and June 2021. These transactions extended our weighted average maturities by about five years and reduced the average coupon of our notes outstanding. During the quarter, we returned $402 million to shareholders in dividends and buybacks. We remain strongly committed to our shareholder distribution program and to closing the Kokusai Electric transaction. We're having constructive discussions to close the final regulatory approval we need. We continue to expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to our non-GAAP financial results, and we look forward to providing you with a new financial model soon after we close the proposed transaction. Next, I'll expand on the performance trends Gary highlighted in his remarks. We've discussed our conviction in the attractiveness of our markets and the opportunity we have to generate strong returns by consistently investing for growth. The investments we've made in recent years are resulting in momentum that's already visible today and will accelerate as new nodes ramp over the next several years. Let's examine how Applied's revenue is profiling in the first half of the calendar year, which is our fiscal Q2 plus fiscal Q3. Compared to the same period last year, our semiconductor systems revenue is up 23%. This compares very favorably with our closest peers. In foundry, we're significantly outperforming in the market. We're winning critical new applications in advanced patterning, and we're working closely with customers to develop next-generation transistors and interconnects, using innovative approaches like our integrated materials solutions. This is strengthening our leadership in foundry/logic and also giving us new application wins in memory, where we're outperforming in the market as well. In fact, we believe we'll be the number one company in DRAM conductor etch this year, winning greater than 50% of the available market. We look forward to demonstrating more growth as DRAM spending improves and demonstrates Applied's unique ability to perform well in a variety of spending environments. Based on discussions with our customers, we expect momentum to continue throughout the calendar year. Specifically, we believe our revenue in both foundry/logic and memory will be second-half weighted, leading to another year of growth and outperformance for Applied. This strength in our systems business is fuel for growth in our install base business, which is also on track to be up in the second half and into the future. As new systems go off warranty, we have opportunities to win subscription-like long-term service agreements, which are a significant growth multiplier for our parts and service revenue. Now I'll share our fiscal Q4 business outlook. We expect company revenue to be approximately $4.6 billion plus or minus $200 million. The midpoint of the range would be up by around 23% year over year. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $1.17 plus or minus $0.06. Within this outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to be approximately $3.025 billion, which would be up about 31% year over year. Applied Global Services revenue should be about $1.07 billion or up about 10% year over year. And display revenue should be about $475 million. Non-GAAP gross margin should be about 45.7%, or up nearly 2 points year on year. And non-GAAP OpEx should be around $820 million. In summary, Applied delivered double-digit revenue growth across all of our segments in Q3, with strong operating leverage. We're pleased to see how the investments we've made are translating to growth and relative outperformance both in foundry/logic and also in memory, where we've made significant investments in recent years. The company is also positioned to weather cycles better than ever, with our install base now driving a third of our revenue and 60% of our parts and service business coming through subscriptions. I'm incredibly proud of our teams for driving our innovation, increasing our shipments and customer support, all while driving strong shareholder returns in a very challenging environment. Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, I'm going to ask you to please ask just one question and not more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on the gross margins, really great performance year on year, both for the actual and the guide, and just curious. Firstly, how should we think about any room for upside just based on lower expenses related to reduced costs associated with COVID, logistics, et cetera? And then as you think about the portfolio that you've kind of discussed that you see in the next year or two, can we get back to that peak 36.6% we saw in 2018 for silicon?
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, C.J. On gross margin, the company has performed really well in the current environment. You talk about the year-over-year performance. If you take a look at our guide, we're going to be up almost 200 basis points into the fiscal Q4, so the company is performing really well. I would like to underscore the hard work that our operations and supply chain and logistics team are doing to mitigate the impacts of the current pandemic environment we're in. They've done an absolutely superb job. And so the company is doing well on that front. As we take a step back and think about the longer-term trajectory around gross margins, there's clearly a lot of activity going on inside of the company. This is something we spend a lot of time focused on. And we're hopeful that over time, we've got an opportunity to raise those gross margins, even off of these levels, as we deliver the new innovation to market that Gary talked about in his prepared comments. Ultimately, I don't think we'll ever be satisfied no matter where the gross margins are. But clearly, the company is performing well in the current environment that we're in. Then when we take a step back and look at our semiconductor systems operating margin, again, the company is performing well. I think what you'll see into the coming quarter, while we don't guide operating margin by segment, I think you'll see some strength on that front as well. And so I do think that we've got an opportunity over time to get back to that prior benchmark for the segment. So again, a lot of hard work, and I think the company is doing well in a difficult environment.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: That's very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, it sounds like within your prepared remarks that your view on memory CapEx is actually better than perhaps where we were three months ago. And I think as we listened to Micron today and others in the storage arena, concern that perhaps things might be getting softer. So can you provide some color on how exactly you're seeing memory CapEx trends into the second half of the year and then through 2021? Thank you.
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Sure, C.J. Let me paint a little bit of a bigger picture for you that puts what we're seeing in the memory market in context. And so if we look at WFE this year, our best estimate at this point, given everything we see from the market and our customers, we're going to be up about 10% to 15% year over year. That's off of a 2019 baseline that's about $51.5 billion. We think it's a good number. It's a third-party validated number by VLSI. And so we think we're up 10% to 15%. And as you take a look at our prepared comments, we think that there's going to be strength in both memory and foundry/logic. We think both of those segments for us from a revenue standpoint are both going to be second-half weighted throughout the year. And we think the proportion of spend within WFE is weighted towards foundry/logic. More than 55% of the spend is in foundry/logic. We think that strength continues into next year, both the overall market as well as our position against that opportunity. We see strength into 2021. And we feel like the proportion of spend in 2021 is going to be very similar to what we're seeing this year. So as we look at the back half of calendar 2020, we're not expecting a spike in memory spending, and we're not expecting a precipitous fall. The company is performing well in this environment. You see how well we've performed in the first half of the calendar year versus the first half of calendar 2019, and we're just going to keep competing, delivering innovation for customers, and driving our business. So we feel good about how we're doing.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dan, maybe just to follow up on that, it sounds like in your answer to C.J.'s question that foundry actually gets stronger half-on-half in the second half of the year. I'm just kind of curious. Given that the largest foundry guy spent more than half of his CapEx budget this year, can you help me understand better sort of the business outside of that large guy, and especially coming from China? How much more growth do you see in kind of the – I hate to call it second or third-tier foundries, but let's just use that for lack of a better term, and/or from China as you look into your fiscal fourth quarter guidance?
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Hi, John. Let me try to help you with what we're seeing in the market. So as we look at our foundry/logic business, a couple things I would say. We've been saying for several quarters now that we are going to see strength in foundry/logic throughout the year. Nothing has changed on that front. We see a diversification of spend underway in the market. We see multiple customers ramping multiple nodes with a strong pull for the technology and innovation that we're bringing to market. We see our business significantly outperforming the overall foundry/logic market. And about a quarter ago, about three months ago, we reported our fiscal Q2 revenues, which is the equivalent of calendar Q1 in 2020. And as I look at the profile of foundry/logic spend this year and our revenue against that opportunity, it looks like our fiscal Q2 is going to be the low point for calendar 2020 in terms of foundry/logic business. And then as I think about strength into the back half of the calendar year, which is our fiscal Q4-fiscal Q1, based on everything we see today, things look good. So it's just a fundamental underlying diversification of spend, multiple customers, multiple nodes, and very consistent with what we've been saying now for several quarters.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's helpful, guys. And then maybe as my follow-up for Gary, clearly one of the things that COVID has shone a spotlight on is kind of the strategic importance of semiconductor manufacturing capacity. We've got the CHIPS Act moving its way through Washington. Prime Minister Abe in Japan has talked about building more fabs in Japan, and I think even the EU has set up a commission. I'm just kind of curious from your perspective. How do you see kind of this regionalization of capacity potentially playing out over the next several years and what incremental opportunities it might afford Applied Materials?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, John, for the question. So first I'd echo what Dan said. I was on a call with one of our major foundry/logic customers two nights ago, and not only strength in 2020 but also into 2021. And I think if you take a step back and you look at what's driving this, and it gets back to your question also about the strategic nature of semiconductors, and what we're seeing with COVID-19 is an acceleration of technology transforming every industry. Certainly, my 10-year-old twins are doing learning from home. You have remote working from different locations, e-commerce. All of those things that we've been talking about are accelerating, and we're all living that right now. And you also see kind of from a multiyear secular transition many leading companies developing custom workload-specific silicon that's going to the foundry. So again, you see that happening, even some recent announcements. And I think also when you look at really what is the foundation for the 1 trillion connected devices of the future, it's really all of the semiconductor chips. And you need to keep driving the PPAC. We talk about power, performance, area/cost roadmap to get to the performance per watt that you need to have the right infrastructure for the data economy. So I think that driving power and performance, lower power, higher performance at the right cost is just fundamental to competitiveness going forward and way more important from an economic perspective. And you absolutely see it, like you talked about, with TSMC coming to United States. And I said before that we were certainly encouraging that to happen. I think it's a great thing for the United States. You talked about Abe in Japan and also what's going on in other geographic regions. I think that everyone recognizes the strategic importance of these technologies. I think it will become even more clear to everyone on power, performance, area/cost what's driving that future technology roadmap, and that's again where Applied is in a super-good position. So absolutely, I see that playing out in the way that you've described it. It's certainly good for Applied as customers move into different geographic regions. What we've seen is really a boost in our service business, and certainly it strengthens the strategic relationships we have with a number of different customers.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon, and thank you very much for taking the question. Gary, I was hoping you could provide a little bit of an update on the Kokusai acquisition. You guys talked about it a little bit in your prepared remarks, but what are some of the last standing items? And if you can remind us on the industrial logic of the deal and help us a little bit with the accretion math, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Toshiya. Let me talk about the deal, and then I'll pass it back to Gary to talk about the industrial logic that underpins that transaction. So we've made a lot of good progress on the regulatory front. We closed out five of the six regulatory approvals that we need in this transaction, as you know. So we feel good about that progress. We're having constructive discussions to close the final regulatory approval that we have in the process. We hope to close soon, optimistic about our progress. So we feel good about progress to date. And then just as a reminder, we continue to expect the transaction is going to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP financial results upon close. So we feel we're making good progress.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah, Toshiya, we've talked about the power, performance, area/cost roadmap really being fundamental to how all of our customers compete. And really people also talk about the limitations with 2D scaling, Moore's Law slowing down, classic Moore's Law slowing down. And I just deeply believe – I'm on calls with leading customer CEOs, R&D leaders on a regular basis. And I just really strongly believe that new architectures you'll see emerge over the next two or three years are going to be a big driver of the PPAC roadmap. New structures, new materials, new ways to connect chips together, all of those things, I'm just incredibly optimistic that we're going to be able to drive power, performance, and cost going forward. But it's not going to be what's been happening in the past. So then if you look at Kokusai, Kokusai certainly in memory is very strong. And when we look at what some of those future structures look like, what some of those future architectures or materials look like, Kokusai has some unique technologies where they can go to much higher temperatures. They can process many, many wafers simultaneously. And it gives you another technology that we can combine with all of the other technologies that we have to create, shape, modify, analyze, and connect structures and devices. So we haven't really communicated a lot on the strategic value. We will be doing that as soon as the transaction closes. But there are really some tremendous opportunities in combining these different capabilities together. And certainly, we've made tremendous progress relative to our memory market share over the last few years, and Kokusai will definitely be additive to that.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And, Gary, you talked about your level of outperformance relative to the market in fiscal year 2020. I think you talked about your etch business at the midpoint of your guidance growing 30%. I think you talked about your process control business being up 40% in the year as well. Based on your customer conversations, based on some of the PTOR (00:34:03) wins that you're aware of, when you think about 2021, and if you can compare and contrast the potential level of outperformance into next year relative to what you achieved this year, that would be super-helpful. Thank you.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah, Toshiya, so again, one of the things that's very interesting about the current environment that we're working in, I certainly miss having dinners with R&D leaders and some of our key customers, but I'm actually probably in more frequent connections with many of those different customers, and I'm just really optimistic. If you look at what is driving the roadmap going forward, as I talked about, power, performance area, and cost, we have deep visibility. And the reason we have deep visibility into what's happening at 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer is because we're co-developing the next-generation transistor structures with customers. And the wiring speed is also incredibly important for customers and driving the next nodes from a memory perspective. All of those areas we have very, very, very deep engagement and deep insight into what those architectures will look like. And we've never been in a better position when we look at all of the N+ nodes, I would say, and certainly in foundry and logic. We will continue to grow our etch business. We're in a great position with the Sym3 Y. We're delivering higher yield with that technology on the most critical steps for those customers. So we're in a great position to continue to outperform there. In inspection and measurement, we have two new platforms that we've launched that we're really in the early innings relative to that particular adoption. And then also we have the synergy with our inspection/measurement, not only in driving our PDC business, but accelerating our technology inside Applied's labs and also with customers with new materials and new structures. But when you really look at those next nodes and the materials, the integrated processes that we're delivering with customers, we've just never been in a better position, and I'm very, very optimistic. We have high visibility in terms of what those architectures will look like and also very high visibility in terms of our position.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Toshiya.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon, great job on the quarterly execution. As a follow-up to the last question, it's good to see the strong traction in process control, especially in the optical and e-beam inspection. I think that's about a $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion market opportunity, and it's actually a pretty sticky part of the market. So what are the differentiators that are enabling the team to win here? And then on the metrology side, again, about another $1 billion market opportunity for discrete platforms. Any plans for the Applied team to try and intersect this market opportunity longer term as well?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks for the question. So if you look at our PDC business this year, this fiscal year we'll be significantly over $1 billion if you look at our systems and service business in PDC, and as I said in the prepared remarks, a greater than 40% growth rate. And there really are two things I think that are really important with PDC. One is the PDC growth, and I'll talk about that here in just a minute. But also, our ability to accelerate the PPAC roadmap within Applied on our technologies and also with customers. So if you look at the PDC growth, there are really two major drivers this year. One is a new optical inspection system, and we've already generated several hundred million dollars of revenue with that new optical inspection system, and it's ramping at multiple leading customers. And we're certainly still in the very early innings with the adoption of that new system. And it's really targeted towards line monitoring, where you have multiple inspection points in a fab. And in some of the leading customers driving the PPAC roadmap, we have pretty extensive adoption already of that new optical inspection system. And then the other technology that we've introduced this year is a new e-beam technology that has the highest resolution electron optics in the market today. It's about 60% higher resolution from an e-beam perspective and also has very fast imaging. So that particular technology, when you think about driving the PPAC roadmap with gate-all-around – or one customer I had dinner with in March was talking about nanosheets and the ability to have a very, very high correlation with this higher resolution imaging capability in developing those future transistor technologies. And the same thing is true in memory devices or new interconnects like selective tungsten. All of those areas, having this unique capability is really important relative to driving the technology roadmap going forward. And that particular technology, we have thousands of e-beam products and columns in the field today. But that higher resolution, you can almost think about it EUV versus previous products with a wavelength reduction. It is an enabling foundation for our e-beam leadership for the next decade. So that will proliferate across all of our different platforms. So really those are the two things that are driving our business this year, but also the synergy with our process businesses has also never been better inside our labs and also with customers. So those are the two areas we're driving and I think really in the early innings of continuing drive value in both of those different areas.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you for the insights there. And of the $650 million of backlog that the team wasn't able to ship in the first half of this year, I think, Dan, based on your commentary, it looks like you were able to make much of that up in Q3. But how much more do you have to make up? And would you true everything up exiting Q4, or would there still be some spillover into fiscal Q1?
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Hi, Harlan, so a little color on the $650 million. We talked about $650 million of unmet demand in our fiscal Q2. That was across all device types, spread out between foundry/logic, NAND, DRAM. And in the most recent quarter, our fiscal Q3, as you heard in one of the previous answers, our operations team, supply chain team, logistics team, and our supply chain partners have just done an amazing job in a difficult environment making much better progress than we originally thought three months ago. And so we've got a significant chunk of that $650 million that was satisfied in fiscal Q3. We've got more to go. Our expectation is all of that will be in the rearview mirror exiting our fiscal Q4. And our fiscal Q1, which is calendar Q4, is going to be a first look-through of true end market demand across our markets. And what has me encouraged is, as I look at that true look-through on end market demand and seeing the strength we are across our businesses, it just gives me confidence that we're continuing to see a strong environment by our customers and strong demand and pull for the innovation we're bringing to market to enable their technology roadmaps. I guess the last point I'd make on this is we made comments on our call three months ago about the strong backlog that we are carrying into Q3. Not only did we satisfy a significant chunk of that end market demand in our fiscal Q3, we're entering our fiscal Q4 with the company's backlog virtually unchanged. And so it's a strong endorsement of the strong environment we continue to find ourselves in.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar - Cowen and Company, LLC: You spoke about your strength in DRAM, conductor etch, and overall DRAM verticals. How much of this strength is coming from the fact the DRAM is more getting logic-like in terms of profit? All I'm trying to figure out is can this DRAM subset be translated into NAND, or is NAND a whole different beast?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: This is Gary. So certainly, high-speed memory is a big focus for a number of different customers. So like you said on the high-k/metal gate technologies, those are areas where we have significant leadership, and that's helping to drive our DRAM business. And also in etch, we've grown our etch business a significant amount in DRAM. If you look at the conductor etch, we gained almost 30 points of conductor etch share in DRAM since 2016 with the Sym3 platform, so really good drivers there. And as these new high-speed memories are adopted and ramp up in the next technology node, it puts us in a really good position to continue to outperform from a DRAM perspective. And in NAND, you have different drivers, but it really still is about scaling the number of layers going vertical. And we have a number of very innovative films, different compounds that are being adopted in the next-generation NAND devices. So the combination of those very, very high selectivity films with our etch products position us to perform well also in NAND. And the other thing I would say – really the other thing I would say, and I talked about this a little bit earlier, is Kokusai will be definitely additive to Applied overall from a memory perspective. If you think back over the last several years, we've grown our memory business share of total spend for both NAND and DRAM from the mid-teens to 20% or more in those different segments. So we think – we believe we're very well positioned in both NAND and DRAM going forward, and certainly Kokusai will add to that overall performance.
Krish Sankar - Cowen and Company, LLC: That makes sense, Gary. And then as a follow-up, your semiconductor business is getting less cyclical these days, but display is still very deeply cyclical. So I'm kind of curious. How important is display to the long-term strategic rationale of the company?
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks a lot for the question. As we think about the display business, Krish, we see display as a great opportunity to take core technology into adjacent markets, drive enhanced revenue and cash flow for the company. And as we sit here today, we know we're at a cyclical bottom. The market continues to bounce along the bottom. We do think there are opportunities going forward for this market to grow structurally larger off the levels that we're at now. What we're seeing in the current environment is a strengthening post the initial stages of COVID that gives us some confidence as we look into 2021. And then as we take a look at the technology inflections on the horizon, OLED coming to TV, foldable/flexible displays coming to the handset, both of those technology inflections being more capital-intensive than the current generation of technologies, we think there's some growth on the horizon in this market. So it's a great way to take core technology and monetize it in an adjacent market to drive enhanced revenue and cash flow for the company.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Hey, thanks, Krish. And we still have a lot of people in the queue, so operator, I'd like to ask that we please do one question at this time and no follow-ups. Okay, so please give us our next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel Financial Corp.: ...quarter. Gary, maybe as a follow-up to some of the technology questions that have been asked already, can you give a little bit of color of how Applied can continue to outperform? You mentioned process control, conductor etch. You have new technologies, like you mentioned gate-all-around, nanowires, and others. Can you I guess maybe provide a little more color in terms of some of the opportunities, maybe a little more on the conductor etch side but also in your core deposition businesses as well?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Okay, thanks for the question, Patrick. Wow, that's a very broad one. But let me say that I deeply believe and I love the technology. I love interacting with R&D leaders for our customers. And I would just say – and you see this dynamic in the marketplace driving power, performance, area/cost faster than others. Low power, higher performance at a better cost is really the key focus for all of our customers. And I talked a lot about what drives the roadmap going forward. It really is about new architectures, new structures, interconnect structures. Certainly that includes gate-all-around, but there are other technologies we're working on that are really, really, really important for customers. New interconnect technologies so that you reduce the resistance in the wiring, that's also a key, key driver for all of our customers. New ways to connect the chips together from a packaging standpoint, all the new materials that we're bringing to market. So there are a number of those different areas that are super-important relative to driving the PPAC roadmap going forward. And I would say that one thing that I'm just so encouraged with, our portfolio, when you look at creating, shaping, modifying, analyzing, connecting devices and structures, there's no one that can do all of those different things. And even if you look at FinFET today, I talked about a technology where we integrate together multiple products or multiple different chambers on a single platform under vacuum to manage interfaces, where we can improve leakage current far beyond what exists today. So you think about improving the leakage current or a 10% improvement in drive current, that is incredibly, incredibly important. And that particular technology, again, is an integrated materials solution. It works in FinFET. And I think there's a high probability you'll see that coming to market sometime in the next year for some of our customers. You have that technology can also work in gate-all-around or our nanosheets. Again, there's just a number of different areas where we're driving innovation. We announced recently selective tungsten, which is kind of like atomic layer 3D printing, to increase the diameter of the wire to reduce the resistance. That is a really big technology development for our customers, driving the PPAC roadmap forward. And the other thing I talked about, combining these things together with the highest resolution electron beam imaging capability in the industry and proprietary algorithms where you can – and very high-speed imaging, so you can image thousands of points on a wafer, look at the key technologies that are being developed, look at the spatial distribution, and dial in your process windows for all of those new technologies lightning fast with a combination of massive, unique, actionable insight and data analytics and machine learning that we have developed within Applied. Those are really game-changer technologies. So it's really a combination of many of those enabling, creating materials and films, shaping, modifying. We have many unique technologies, the analyzing many unique technologies. The combination of those things together also means that we're strategically connected to customers in a very unique way. We have unique insights into their future technology nodes, their future architectures, the critical challenges that customers are facing. And the pull, Patrick, that we have from our customers has never been stronger.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks a lot. Gary, I guess I had a bigger picture question on the indigenous China market. And it seems like more than half of the growth in overall WFE this year is coming from indigenous China. And I guess my question is, can you update us on the $9.5 billion that you were sort of implying last call? And really, like bigger picture here, it sounds like there really wasn't any impact from the recent military end-use stuff. And my question really is, can you talk about the discussions you had with Commerce? They expanded regulation and it had zero impact. So sort of what are the tone of the discussions tells you that this is it for a while or whether there could be a further effort to additionally and truly restrict access? Thanks.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah, Tim, thanks for the question. I'll start off and then Dan can answer the market size question. So relative to the geopolitical question, I'm not going to speculate on any future actions that can take place. But really, what we've seen today is similar to what and consistent with what we've previously discussed. We've assessed the rules, and as we had discussed in our last call, we continue to see no meaningful impact on our business. And so I'll also let Dan answer the overall market question.
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Gary. Hi, Tim. So as we think about the market in China, domestic China market, off of a baseline of about $6.5 billion in 2019, we've been saying for several quarters now that we see $2 billion to $3 billion of incremental spend. And a couple quarters ago, I think, or last quarter, we said we're going to be at the high end of that range. And so we're at about $9.5 billion of spend. It's pretty consistent with how we viewed that market for several quarters now. And as I think about the profile of spend in China, we do see slow, steady development of ecosystems, investment in technology roadmaps. You see modest capacity additions behind that. You probably see a little more capacity this year. But it's not a lot more. It's a little more. And we see spend across 200-millimeter, 300-millimeter geometries. You see from a device type standpoint investment in foundry/logic, DRAM, NAND. So it's really a balanced profile of spend and slow, steady development of their ecosystem, but no real change in the profile as we viewed the market for several quarters now.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Joe Quatrochi - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you can kind of talk a little bit about the demand you're seeing in memory. How do we think about that being driven for technology transitions versus wafer additions? And how do we think about that into 2021 as we kind of see more normalized fab utilization rates this year?
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, Joe. So that's the great thing about what we see today is we still see investments in technology transitions of our customers. We still don't see, nor do we see in the back half of the year, a big spike from a capacity standpoint. And one of the things that we're really encouraged about given the performance of our business relative to the market opportunity, we're growing stronger than the overall market. It just shows us that we're well positioned from an innovation standpoint to deliver key enabling technologies for our customers and their roadmaps. So we really don't see a lot of capacity wafer starts going into the industry. We see continued investment from a technology roadmap standpoint.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. And, operator, we have time for two more questions, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Co. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. I just wanted to follow up on that last question. If I heard your prepared comments, I think you said that you didn't see a big shift in the mix between foundry/logic and memory as we head into 2021. I just, one, wanted to confirm that. And two, I guess I'm surprised by that comment because I think we've all been looking for probably a better capacity addition next year in memory. And if the mix stays the same, it feels like maybe we're not going to get it. So I was hoping you could expand on your thoughts on memory, particularly from a capacity perspective looking into calendar 2021.
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Hi, Quinn. So what we're seeing in the market is continued investment from a technology roadmap standpoint. We see strength in the market from a proportion of spend this year. We see more of the spend going to foundry/logic. Over 55% of the aggregate spend is going to be foundry/logic related. We see memory growing a little more than foundry/logic this year. And as we window into 2021, from a proportion of spend, it feels very similar to what we're seeing this year. It's continued strength on our foundry/logic customers. We see it being more than 55% of the spend next year in 2021. And what I would say about the industry is if we go back to 2017-2018, technology transition in the industry, concurrent investment in planar and 3D technologies, new architectures, I would say there was an inefficient level of spend as it relates to bit addition to the industry. I think you're seeing a much more efficient spend profile. Over time, we see capital intensity rising, but you're seeing a much more efficient bit production out of CapEx that's going into the industry. The other thing I'd say is we've got a very balanced portfolio from a share standpoint across all device types, so we're a very balanced company. And we're fairly agnostic to where customers want to spend, whether it's foundry/logic, NAND, DRAM. I think we're set up to perform well in all of those environments given our broad portfolio. So we'll watch the market, and we'll continue to update every quarter on what we're seeing.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Quinn.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya - BofA Securities, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. I know it's hard to reconcile on a real-time basis, but I'm curious. How do we reconcile your encouraging words on memory demand with somewhat mixed picture and the views from some of your memory customers who are mentioning some deceleration in data center demand or some declines in China smartphones, as an example? So I completely understand and appreciate that your demand and their demand doesn't have to correlate on a real-time basis, but how are you ensuring that your memory customers are shipping to their end demand?
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Again, our comments reflect continued pursuit of technology roadmaps. And all we're doing is reflecting the strength of our business, and we talked about the first half of the calendar year. Calendar year 2020 over the first half of calendar year 2019, our DRAM business is up 20%, our NAND business is up 14%. Over the last couple quarters sequentially, two quarters ago memory was up for us 24%, the most recent quarter up almost 17%. We're seeing sequential performance in both NAND and DRAM. And so it's more of a comment of what we're seeing in the demand for our business as our customers roll out their technology roadmaps. And in an environment where technology roadmaps define the cost structure of our customers, it's cost per bit. We see continued investment on roadmaps with modest additions from a capacity standpoint to drive the bit demand growth that the market is requiring.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Vivek, for your question. And, Dan, any closing thoughts for today?
Daniel J. Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Sure, Mike. So what stands out for me, especially in this quarter, is how investments in our strategy are translating to growth and outperformance in the market. I like the balanced share we now have as a company, and that's across all device types. I like that we're generating one-third of our total business from our install base, and that's going to give us more predictable revenue and cash flow over time. I really want to thank our employees and partners for aggressively ramping up to meet our customers' needs in a really difficult environment and doing it safely. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Citi Conference and a whole bunch of virtual events sprinkled throughout the quarter. Until then, keep safe. Mike, let's close the call.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 Pacific Time. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-05-14 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Applied’s second quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that today’s call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied’s Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today’s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today’s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings presentation, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. I'd like to start today's call by addressing the topic at the forefront of everyone's mind, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created unprecedented challenges around the world. My thoughts and best wishes go out to all of you and especially those whose families have been directly affected by the illness. As the situation has evolved over the past several months, our actions at Applied Materials have been guided by two key principles. First, maintaining the trust of our employees, customers, suppliers, and partners. And second, focusing on driving initiatives that will allow us to emerge stronger over the longer term. As always, our number one priority is the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families. Our workforce remains highly productive, many are working effectively from home and for those working on site, we've implemented strict safety protocols, in close collaboration with our medical advisors, customers and suppliers. In our factories, labs and logistics centers, we've changed physical layouts to allow for social distancing, introduced enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, implemented health screenings and mandated the use of personal protective equipment. All our employees and contingent workers have continued to receive full pay and we've introduced additional incentives and benefits for employees supporting our critical operations. While we've been working through certain supply chain constraints, we have remained laser focused on the needs of our customers and doing what it takes to keep their factories running smoothly and their R&D programs on track.  Across the company, I see amazing examples of our manufacturing, logistics, and field operations teams going above and beyond to keep our customers and the industry moving forward in a difficult set of circumstances. We're also defining new ways of working with customers that not only provide solutions today, but will also create significant benefits over the long term.  Finally, in line with Applied's long held values to make a positive contribution to the communities where we live and work. We've created a global charitable COVID fund. The purpose of this fund is to address immediate humanitarian needs and combat long-term effects on local communities and the non-profit sector. We've also donated masks and equipment to medical facilities. And in addition, there have been numerous employee driven initiatives across the company. It's inspiring to see these employees stepping forward to help volunteering their time, skills and resources to demonstrate our shared passion to make a difference.  Now, let me turn to the agenda for today's call. I'll begin with a summary of our second quarter performance and near-term outlook. Then I'll provide a longer-term perspective on our markets. And I'll finish with a summary of our strategy highlighting some of our recent accomplishments. Later, Dan will give more color on our financial results, operational performance and business environment.  Starting with our near term business outlook demand from our semiconductor customers remains strong. In fiscal Q2, our financial performance was negatively affected by our ability to ship systems to customers as shelter in place and locked down orders impacted some of our suppliers’ operations, particularly in the Bay Area and Malaysia. However, we're in a much better position today. Thanks to the flexibility in our global operations footprint, we've been able to make adjustments. And we continue to work closely with our suppliers to ensure they can meet our needs. Our supply chain remains a critical area of focus as we enter our third quarter with record orders and a record backlog for our semiconductor and service businesses combined. In terms of the semiconductor industry environment, I will focus my comments on what we currently see in the market and what we're hearing from customers. In foundry/logic demand at the leading edge remains very healthy with a strong commitment from these customers to build out their factories and push forward with their development road maps. However, we're seeing some pockets of weakness in specialty markets, mainly as a result of a pullback in the automotive and industrial sectors. In memory, there are no major changes to the outlook we provided last quarter. We continue to see a positive progression in the market with inventory levels, approaching normal and improvements in pricing trends.  As a result, we're seeing incremental strength in investment by memory customers as we move through the year. Based on the visibility that we have today, underlying demand for semiconductor equipment is robust. And even when COVID-related effects are taking into account, we still believe that our semiconductor business can deliver strong double digit growth for our fiscal year. In display, we expect our FY 2020 revenues to be close to FY 2019 as the industry navigates the bottom of this spending cycle.  Our display business remains solidly profitable, even as we invest in next generation products ready for when the market picks up. Looking further out, we're well aware of global economic concerns. While I'm not going to speculate on possible macro scenarios, I will share some of the key assumptions that we're using to guide our strategy, which are based on carefully monitoring market indicators and staying very close to our customers. Clearly, consumer spending is a potential headwind for many sectors, including the electronics industry. At the same time, the global pandemic is acting as an accelerator for key technology inflections that were already under way. Working from home, learning from home and e-commerce are driving investments in cloud data centers and communications infrastructure. We expect companies to build stronger business continuity plans, which will include geographic redundancy and increased use of automation and IoT technologies and the adoption of AI and big data remains non-discretionary for many companies. As I've said before, these game changing technologies will transform entire industries and there will be big winners and losers through the transition. My personal view is that we will see significant and permanent changes in the way companies operate and prioritize their investments. In fact, this is already happening in our business and the ways we are working with customers. Over the past several years, we made significant investments in state-of-the art, digital infrastructure, sensors, and metrology, data science, machine learning and simulation.  The combination of these technologies enables us to reduce product development cycles, speed up transfer of new technologies from lab to fab and optimize cost output and yield for our customers and volume production. In the past few months, our field and R&D teams have been working with customers to further expand secured data sharing, to enhance remote support and accelerate the deployment of these powerful new tools. In our own labs, we also have many examples of R&D teams increasing utilization and productivity of lab assets, by applying creative new strategies for mode operations. While near-term actions are being driven by necessity, the long-term benefits of working this way are compelling as they provide significant time to market and cost advantages for Applied and our customers. Our long-term perspective about AI and big data shaping the next decade is unchanged. And we see strong potential for certain elements of these inflections to scale faster than previously expected. As I've said before, to enable these new computing systems and unlock the potential of AI technologies, major advances in the power, performance, and area of cost or PPAC of semiconductor devices are needed.  Based on recent input from customers, we've updated our PPAC framework to PPACT, where T stands for time to market, acknowledging the enormous value of speed. Applied has by far, the largest broad portfolio of technologies and products to accelerate the PPACT playbook which spans creating, shaping, modifying, analyzing and connecting structures and devices. We're the only company with process and metrology under one roof. And we have highly differentiated silicon and packaging lab capabilities. As a result, we have a significant advantage in our ability to accelerate new PPACT innovations for the semiconductor ecosystem. The capabilities we have built and the multi-year investments we have made are yielding results. According to VLSI Research’s recently published report. We outperformed the market in both semiconductor equipment and services last year. Our performance in deposition technology was especially strong with our PVD business gaining seven points of share. We also have great momentum in metrology and inspection. Our process diagnostics and control group delivered record revenue in the first half of the year. One of the key contributors to this record performance is our new optical inspection system that we will be officially launching later this year. Before I hand the call over to Dan, I will quickly summarize. First as we navigate the challenges created by COVID-19, we've rallied the company around two guiding principles, maintain the trust of employees, customers, suppliers, and partners, and focus on driving actions that ensure Applied Materials emerges stronger over the longterm.  Second while we're mindful of potential macroeconomic headwinds, based on what we see and hear today, semiconductor equipment demand remains robust and our supply chain is getting healthier. Third, we remain fully committed to our strategy to accelerate the PPACT playbook and our pipeline of new innovative products and integrated processes has never been better.  Now, I will turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. Today, I'll summarize our second quarter results and activities. Give you an update on the environment and share our current expectations for the second half of our fiscal year. As a reminder on March 23, we suspended our Q2 guidance because of the global response to COVID-19 was creating significant challenges across our supply chain, manufacturing, operations, and logistics. Due to the extreme uncertainty, we also decided to borrow against our revolving credit facility. We promised to provide our investors with an update on this earnings webcast, and I'll do that in a moment. This afternoon, we announced our Q2 results, which were below our original guidance, but solid considering the extreme challenges our teams faced due to COVID. I'm proud of our employees for putting health and safety first and still doing everything possible to support our customers, both in keeping our factories running and by keeping our R&D programs moving. Despite the incremental challenges we experienced in the last six weeks of our quarter, we delivered AGS and display revenue that was higher than our original expectations in February. Our semi systems revenue was below our original outlook, and that was entirely due to COVID-related supply constraints and demand remains strong. And while the environment remains fluid, we exited the quarter with the second highest company backlog in our history and record backlog for semi systems plus AGS combined. For the company as a whole in Q2 on a year-over-year basis, we grew revenue by 12%, increased non-GAAP operating profit by 23% and grew non-GAAP EPS by 27% to $0.89. During the quarter, we returned $392 million to shareholders in buybacks and dividends and announced a dividend increase of nearly 5%. We ended Q2 with nearly $7.4 billion on the balance sheet, including $1.5 billion in credit facility proceeds. Now I'll share my assessment of the COVID environment, which includes several encouraging developments. Our industry has been designated critical infrastructure in many parts of the world. All of our suppliers have now been able to resume operations and they were recovering to normal output. We've been in very close communications with our customers and their demand indications remained strong.  We're mindful of the macro economic impacts of COVID including job losses in the consumer and industrial sectors of the global economy. But governments have provided strong financial support to workers, businesses and the banking system. As a result of our assessment of the environment, we fully repaid our revolving credit facility, borrowings subsequent to the end of the quarter. We currently have approximately $5.9 billion of cash and investments on the balance sheet, which is an increase of about $200 million compared to our Q1 balance. We are continuing to prepare for the planned acquisition of Kokusai Electric. During Q2, we received Taiwan's clearance for the transaction, and we have one final approval pending from China. Turning to the business outlook, while I see positive signs, there is still potential for COVID-related disruptions around the world, and we're not providing revenue and earnings guidance for Q3. I know there is concern about the risk of further economic impacts and changes in customer investment patterns, but rather than speculate, I'll attempt to help our investors by providing visibility into what we are seeing across our operating segments.  In semiconductor systems, our Q2 revenue would have been nearly $650 million higher absent COVID related constraints. We hope to recover this revenue in Q3 and Q4 as the supply chain improves. In the second quarter our semi systems orders were up significantly and demand is broadening to more customers based on what we're hearing from our customers. We believe Q3 semi revenue could be up in the high single digits, sequentially and higher again in Q4 resulting in strong double digit growth for the fiscal year. Our services business has proven highly resilient during the crisis, and we continue to generate a growing proportion of revenue from subscription like long-term service agreements. AGS posted its first $1 billion dollar quarter ever in Q2 with nearly 60% of revenue coming from service agreements. In Q3, we believe AGS revenue could be flat to slightly higher sequentially and higher again in Q4. Within AGS, our semi parts and services business has grown to $3.2 billion or 24% of our company's semi-related revenue.  VLSI research has begun to size and compare the parts and service revenue of companies in the industry. Ours is the strongest among our peers, both on a dollar basis and as a percent of our semi-related revenue. Our total semiconductor installed based business, which includes parts, services, 200-millimeter systems and 300-millimeter upgrades and refurbs has grown to become 38% of our semi-related revenue. This ratio is about five points higher than our peers. As Gary indicated, we still expect our display revenue to be nearly the same this year as last. We believe revenue is likely to be flat to slightly higher sequentially in Q3 and higher again in Q4. In short, if the demand indications from our customers hold and our supply chains continue to improve, then we should have second half weighted revenue in each segment. Based on everything we see today, this would translate to sequential revenue growth and earnings growth in Q3, and then again in Q4. So in summary, while the situation remains fluid and macroeconomic impacts are still unknown, our customers remain committed to their technology roadmaps and are signaling growth for Applied. We will remain vigilant, stay close to our customers and be ready to respond quickly if the environment changes. Once again, I'm incredibly proud of our employees for their strong commitment to health and safety and their strong support of our customers, both in meeting today's demand that our factories and theirs and innovating in our R&D labs to enable the technology of the future. Now, Mike let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. There are a lot of people on the call today. So to help us reach as many of you as we can, I'm going to ask you to please ask just one question and not more than one brief followup. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, you talked about expectations for incremental strength from memory through the calendar year. I was hoping perhaps you could elaborate on that in terms of mix between both NAND and DRAM as well as new wafer starts versus strengths. And what gives you the confidence that, that is sustainable in this world of COVID?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, C.J. As we look into the year, we see the year profiling pretty similar from a proportion of spend standpoint that we talked about a quarter ago. We see strength in foundry/logic continuing throughout the year as our order book and customer base broadens, and we feel good about that. As we profile to memory, we talked about seeing some incremental strength this year, both on DRAM and NAND. I think it's too early to call the magnitude of that, but we do see balance across the device types from a spend standpoint. And I do think there is going to be similarities in terms of 2019 being an investment year, primarily focused on technology road maps.  And we actually saw wafer starts per month last year, 2019, actually go down year-over-year in both DRAM and NAND. And as we look into this year, we don't really see strong capacity adds. We continue to see our customers driving their technology road maps. Because that is, in effect, their cost structure. It allows them to drive margins and cash flow when industries recover. So we see continued investments from a technology road map standpoint, but we see probably less wafer starts per month coming out of the system than we did the year before. So it's sort of on the margin. We continue to stay close. We will watch it. And we'll continue to be open and transparent. In an environment that's defined by uncertainty, what we want to try to do is be as helpful as possible, share with investors the things we're seeing and hearing from our customers and we'll let you know what we see each quarter as the situation evolves.
C.J. Muse: That's helpful. If I could sneak a quick follow-up, Mike. On gross margins, can you speak to how you see the trajectory into the second half considering what looks to be a positive mix from both silicon and AGS? And also as it relates to supply chain, I think you took out $8 million of COVID-related expenses. Is that something that should sustain into the back half? How should we be thinking about that? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, C.J. I'll take both. As we think about the actions the company took in the current environment, we made conscious decisions about how we were going to position ourselves from an operating and manufacturing standpoint and decisions were made very early in the process. We implemented our business continuity team in the middle of January. And as part of contingency planning and mapping out potential points of risk, we made decisions to put in place surge capacity from a personnel standpoint. And that decision was made probably the first week of February. So clearly there is an impact to maintain cycle times and throughputs that are on par with where we were before COVID. That's a result of really strong teamwork and execution and planning. But it certainly has a headwind from a margin standpoint. And we're optimizing around serving our customers and taking care of the things that we can take care of so we can better withstand the things we can't control which is what we saw from a supply chain disruption standpoint and the rate and pace of that recovery. So we feel good about that. But certainly it does create a bit of a headwind. And you see that profiling through some of the segments and I'm happy to share more of that thinking, but it's definitely there. From a gross margin standpoint, as we look into next quarter what we signaled was a favorable segment mix and in a normal environment that would create improvement from a gross margin standpoint. What I'd also say is what we experienced in our most recent quarter was six weeks of impact of a material supply chain disruption driven by a concurrent shelter-in-place order in the Bay Area and Malaysia. It affected a material part of our supply chain, but it was a six-week impact. Going into Q3, we've got a full 13-week impact as the supply chain becomes healthier and that will sort of offset a bit of the favorable segment mix. So I think the best way to think about our gross margin as we look into Q3 from a planning assumption standpoint is to think about it flat. If we can do better, we certainly will. But we'll take it one quarter at a time and give investors our best view of what we see and the pluses and minuses as we manage the business to the best of our ability in this environment.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. First for Gary. Company gained 0.5 point of equipment share last year and served variable markets led by deposition. Which end markets or technologies are you more confident to show outsized growth this year and next year? And as a follow-up, Dan, I'm curious what your take is on recent Department of Commerce's China equipment licensees for the future shipments.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks for the question. I think I'll take both of those. So let me start with market share. And starting from an overall company perspective, one of the things that we've discussed before is that we have very good balance across all device segments, including leading and trailing logic, DRAM and NAND. This enables us to perform well really regardless of the device mix. It gives us ability to perform well in pretty much any environment. So if we look at overall, 2019 was a good year for us. Your question I think is related to 2020. We look at 2020 as also a very good setup for us. As I said in the prepared remarks, we anticipate strong double-digit growth for Applied in 2020. And what I would say is that in this new environment, I used to travel a significant amount. And I'm still on the phone very frequently with CEOs, R&D leaders. In fact, I had a call with one of the CEOs this morning. And one of the things that's a real advantage for Applied is the traction we have with customers to accelerate their PPACT road maps. And that really is both for memory and also for foundry and logic. So performance in 2019, we gained about two points in the markets that we serve and a 0.5 point overall WFE share. So if we look at the setup for 2020, we continue to see strong foundry/logic investments where we have leadership products, PVD, epi, strong traction in new etch applications. We see currently double-digit growth in our memory business, strong double-digit growth in memory, gaining traction with new capabilities that are key for scaling and strong growth in memory patterning applications. So overall, again we have balance across all of these different segments. I would say that our pipeline of our new products in our integrated materials solutions has never been better relative to accelerating PPACT road maps for customers. Then the second question is around, I think the export controls. So let me start with a perspective of the overall geopolitical situation. And I've said before on this one, Applied believes in fair trade and intellectual property protection. The semi ecosystem and innovation road map rely on these principles.  So regarding the new regulations that were recently announced by the Department of Commerce, we're working very closely with the U.S. government, trade associations and our advisors to better define the requirements for the industry and to be able to comply with the new regulations. We have some very good people working on this and based on our work to-date, our current expectation is Applied is going to be able to meet the government's required standards when the rules come into effect at the end of June without significant disruptions to our business. If needed, we have significant flexibility in our global operations footprint and we're developing contingency plans that we could implement. But again overall, we believe we're going to be able to meet the government's required standards when the rules become effective.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Atif.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking the question. Gary, I was hoping you could give us an update on your business in China, both on the memory side as well as the logic and foundry side. One of your foundry customers just raised CapEx, I think it was yesterday, by $1 billion plus. I'm guessing the activity on the memory side continues to be pretty robust as well. But if you can give us an update on what you're seeing near term and what your expectations are for the second half that would be great. And then I've got a quick follow-up.
Dan Durn: Hi, Toshiya. I'll jump in on that question. So as we think about China, let's talk about where we ended 2019 and use that as a jumping-off point to talk about what we see incrementally into 2020 as it relates to domestic China spend. So if we look back into 2019, the market sizing was about $6.5 billion. And a quarter ago, we set our expectation for 2020 was an incremental $2 billion to $3 billion of domestic China spend. Our expectation in 2020 is still $2 billion to $3 billion. But now, given the customer news overnight, we're probably at the high end of that range. And so a quarter ago as we think about the decomposition of that incremental spend, we said about one-third 200 millimeter trailing node foundry specialty logic spend, two-thirds of it was 300 millimeter. And as you decompose the 300 millimeter spend, it was roughly split 50-50 between foundry/logic and memory with balance among device types in memory. And as you think about us at the higher end of the range now, think about incrementally more spend in 300 millimeter trailing node foundry/logic. And I think that gives you an evolution of that spend profile of how the now $2.5 billion to $3 billion is spend toward the high end of that incremental range. That's the best insight we have at this point based on everything we see in the market and what we're talking with our customers about.
Toshiya Hari: That's helpful, Dan. Thank you. And then I think this one is for Gary. I just wanted to follow up on some of your market share comments. I think you said you gained seven percentage points of share in PVD. I was curious what you're seeing on the etch side in terms of market share. And you also spoke to your new product in optical inspection. If you can kind of speak to the differentiating factors for your tool with some of the competition and what your aspirations are over the next couple of years in terms of market share, that would be great. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, so let me start with the PDC business overall, and then I’ll answer the edge question. So our inspection measurement business is one of the segments where we have strongest momentum. We talked about the record last quarter we had in the first half of FY2020. And this is far above our previous best half year for the business. We've got strong – we will achieve strong double digit growth overall in 2020 and semi. And this segment will be one of the highest growth businesses for us this year, the inspection and measurement business. Relevant to the new optical inspection system, we have tremendous momentum with that system. We'll launch it later this year, very, very strong adoption in foundry/logic. I'd say the other thing that is positive relative to our PDC business is in e-beam. We have a strong leadership position we have also some new capabilities there, the highest resolution imaging technology in the industry and very strong initial adoption with new capability there with leading customers. So again, we're off to a great start in 2020 in PDC. And I would say the best position that we've ever had relative to that business. Etch to also, I think, as you know, we've had tremendous growth in the conductor etch business about 5x in terms of revenue growth between 2020 and 2018. And this is also where we have probably the best product, most successful product ever in the history of Applied Materials to SIM3. Relative to 2019, we gained about a half a point of overall Etch share. And in 2020, we also anticipate strong double digit growth in Etch. We have good momentum in memory, significant traction with all leading customers in foundry/logic where we haven't had very high shares, it’s been very low in the past. We have really significant traction there. And a new product in packaging that also has strong momentum. So overall we anticipate strong growth in 2020 and we have good momentum with new capabilities and confidence that we're going to continue to grow Etch’s share going forward.
Toshiya Hari: Thanks guys. See you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for, letting me ask the question. Dan I think I just want to try to better understand the impact of the supply constraints you are seeing from COVID. You talked about it impacting the April quarter by like $650 million and you said you will be able to make that up in both the fiscal third and fourth quarter. But then you also said in an answer to a question that you'd have some gross margin headwinds in the fiscal third quarter because you'd have 13 weeks of sort of these supply issues. And so I guess my question is supply also impacting what you can ship in the fiscal third quarter if so by how much? And when do you think we get to a situation where you guys can actually meet the demand that's on your books?
Dan Durn: Yeah, thanks John. Let me try to unpack it a little bit for you and give you a sense of how we think about it. Hopefully that gives you insight that addresses the question. And if I miss something, please let me know and I'll definitely follow-up. So as we think about where the supply chain is and how the supply chain gets healthier over time, I think, it's important to break it up into three components. And we'll deal with each of these three buckets in sequence. The first, our suppliers back in business, raising their staffing levels and getting back to pre-COVID levels of output. That's sort of a set of issues bucket one. Bucket two, how quickly can they make up for lost volumes? And then the third bucket is, is the logistics channels and how they get healthier over time. And so as we think about the time sequence and overlay of each of those three vectors, all of our suppliers are back in the game, they're working back to hundred percent staffing levels and getting back to pre-COVID levels of output. I think exiting our fiscal Q3, I think, a good portion, a disproportionate share of that will be behind us. That leaves then the second bucket, which is how quickly can you make up for lost volumes? I think that happens given the robust environment we see. I think that happens over our fiscal Q4 and our fiscal Q1. So exiting the calendar year, it should be a direct read through on true and market demand in terms of our business activity, based on what we can see today, that looks like the trajectory.  The third bucket, the logistics, this is something that's going to be a longer term issue to get back to normal. And the reason I say that is there's a correlation between the commercial airline industry and the logistics channels. What I mean is if we're not shipping a full system, full systems, they'll go on special freighter aircraft. A lot of what we do, short of a full system will ride in the belly of a commercial aircraft. We've had to pivot that to alternative freight and logistics channels. And the costs associated with that have risen and create a margin headwind. Given the correlation to the health of the commercial industry, I think, this one is with us for the foreseeable future. And we're likely to have those increased freight and logistics costs stick with us until we can see the degrees of freedom in commercial aviation begin to get much healthier and more active versus the levels today. So if you hear my comments about that margin headwind being around for a while, I sort of disconnect that from the fundamental health of the supply chain. I think we're back, our suppliers are back to pre-COVID levels of output exiting the current fiscal quarter. I think the balance of the calendar year we make up for lost volumes, hard to predict at this point when the commercial aviation channels begin to free up to something similar to what we saw pre-COVID. Hopefully that shed some light on how we're seeing things John and answers your question.
John Pitzer: That's really helpful. And then as my follow-up, Gary, there has been a lot of investor focus on the opportunities you might have in China and maybe some of the risks associated with that from just a geopolitical perspective. Over the weekend we kind of got a different flavor of that with some arguments about perhaps more domestic manufacturing of leading edge semiconductors, not only here in the U.S., but there were some articles out of Japan. I guess I'd be curious, I know it's early, I'd love to get your thoughts on this potential drive for more sovereign manufacturing of leading edge chips. And as you think about that opportunity, would this be sort of redundant capacity in your estimation, or would it be growth capacity, or how do you think that that plays out over the coming years?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question, John. So this has been discussed for a while. But the focus certainly has been increasing with the current geopolitical situation. I can't, of course, share any details of any discussions I've had with anyone on the topic, but for sure this is a good opportunity for the United States and also for Applied. And we'd be very supporting – supportive of making the concept a success. If we look at when our customers go into different geographic regions, it does create a good opportunity for us. If we look at some of our major customers, I'm not going to talk about anyone in specific, but it creates a really great service opportunity for us as they move into a different geographic location, where they don't have the same nucleus or critical mass of technical horsepower. So as we've had discussions with some of the customers that are thinking about moving into different geographic locations, support of course is one of the key aspects of their decision making. And so again, I think, it could be a really good opportunity for Applied Materials. And certainly from a geopolitical standpoint, a good thing for the United States for this opportunity.
John Pitzer: Thanks John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Yes hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on operating in such a tough environment with the results. So first question either for Dan, when I look at the second half you said that there's going to be $650 million that got impacted in April, that's going to flow through in the second half of this year. If you strip out the $650 million, is it fair to assume second half revenues would be lower than the first half of revenues? And then I have a follow-up.
Dan Durn: Yes, Krish just give me a second to pull up the model. Yes, I wouldn't necessarily say that's true. And here is why I go there. First we talked about supply chain, getting back to pre-COVID levels of output throughout our fiscal Q3. So that's an exit rate comment. And implicit in that exit rate comment is the fact that they're not able to supply true end market demand throughout Q3. And we exited Q3, as Gary talked about in his prepared comments, with record backlog in our semi-related business, SSG plus AGS and actually record orders in Q2 as well. So demand continues to be strong and the supply chain will get healthier exiting Q3. And then make up volumes from unmet demand to date through Q3 – I'm sorry, fiscal Q4 and fiscal Q1. So we think we exit the calendar year shipping to true end market demand. So there's a bit of a bleed over of this dynamic into the next fiscal year. And so I think given what we've seen from an order standpoint and what we're entering Q3 with from a backlog perspective, I still think we see strength in the back half of our year. If we break that down by device type, what do we see? We see continued strength throughout the year in foundry, logic. We talked about broadening of our order book in foundry/logic, we talked about multiple customers, multiple nodes we talked about some softness as it relates to things like auto, and industrial, and consumer end markets and that's more trailing node geometries. What we're seeing on the leading edge continues to be strong. As we think about memory, a quarter ago we talked about the second half of the year being the swing factor. And that construct still holds from a memory standpoint, calendar year Q4 is still beyond the horizon of visibility. And so we do think we're in a strong environment and we think the company performed pretty well in the back half of the year even without the 650 million that the – we were unable to meet in the most recent fiscal quarter.
Krish Sankar: Go it. That's pretty helpful Dan. And then just as a follow-up, thanks for the color on your view on the commerce department ruling. I’m curious on the services side, how much of your revenue comes from China? And if you have a view things go negative with the commerce department ruling for you or for the U.S. semi-cap company, what happens to the service revenue especially in the foundry side when you have existing tools out there?
Dan Durn: Yes. So thanks Krish. Let me just try to walk through a little bit of a construct. As we think about the business we do in China today, there we do both semiconductor business and display business. So I'm going to walk you through a bit of a framework of how to think about it to get a sense of how much service business is done in China. So just bear with me as I walk you through this framework. So we do both display and semiconductor business, as you know, in China. So if we take 2019, you add about 29% of our overall company revenue done in China. We've got a large display business, $1.6, almost $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2019. The vast, vast majority of that business goes into China. So if you extract that from the overall China business, that gives you a pretty good look at the size of the semi systems and service business that's done in China. If I then disaggregate it and take the service segment out of that revenue pool and you think about kind of the corporate average service to semi systems, it's kind of a 70-30 split give or take. And so I think that gives you a sense when you extract the display revenues, you get a clean look through on the semi-related business in China. And then you about it as a 70 30 split gives you a sense. But you also have to keep in mind that that service business and systems business service, both multinationals and the domestic industry. And the rough order of magnitude of how the systems business splits up across those two dimensions, think of it maybe 65% domestic, 35% multinational. That gives you a rough framework of how to think about the decomposition of the China business. And hopefully that helps give you a little insight into how to think about that business without being point specific because we don't disclose that level of detail.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Krish.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the foundry/logic side the leading foundry supplier has steadily moved down the path of Moore's Law on the equipment industry has certainly benefited from their aggressive technology migration cadence. Now it looks like that your large logic customer is also getting back on track to executing to a two, two and a half year cadence on node migration, after about a three or four year pause and probably a lot of views. So now that you have multiple large customers in foundry/logic moving at an aggressive cadence over the next few years, how are you guys thinking about the mix of WFE spend foundry/logic versus memory over the next few years?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks Harlan. So as we take a look at what happened in 2019 and then talk about what we see in 2020 but then I also want to project forward. So just kind of breaking it down a little bit, we talked about a quarter ago WFE being about $51 billion, $52 billion in 2019. We think we see the market pretty well. Subsequent to our earnings call a quarter ago, VLSI came out and sized 2019 at $51.5 billion. So right in the middle of how we were thinking about it. So we feel good about that view and it's a good number around 2019. We think about how you decompose that WFE number in 2019 by device type. And it's roughly 60% foundry, 40% memory, balance across the two device types and memory. That gives you a rough order of the structure of the market in 2019. And while I think it's premature today to size the market for a variety of reasons that we can go into premature to size the market in 2020 we think the rough order of split by device type looks and feels similar to what we saw in 2019 so again, another year of 60% foundry/logic, 40% memory with balance between device types. As we look forward, we talk about the new playbook. We talk about the suite of innovation that this company is bringing to market, the ability to integrate those technologies, the ability to drive onboard sensors and metrologies to dial in process recipes faster. There’s a clear enablement strategy by this company to drive our customers power, performance, area, cost and time roadmaps. We think we're incredibly well positioned to do that against the backdrop of rising capital intensity over time, with time being a really important element of this. We have the opportunity to play a really valuable role with our customers in driving that time to market dimension across that new playbook. And that puts us in a really strong position competitively. And we think the dynamic of the position, the innovation, where the market is going in terms of time to market, as well as rising capital intensity, we feel good about where the spend profile and Foundry/logic is going over time. So while I can't be point specific going forward, I think, I gave you some insight in terms of how we, as a company, are thinking about this trend off of where we sit today.
Harlan Sur: Yes, extremely helpful. Thanks for the insights there. And then within your framework for the fiscal second half of the year, from a revenue perspective, how should we think about the trajectory of OpEx for the remainder of the fiscal year from the Q2 levels?
Dan Durn: So if we go back a quarter, we said for the last three quarters of our fiscal year, we would, from a planning assumption standpoint, think about $820 million of OpEx per quarter. As you can see in the current environment, clearly, there're savings from a travel standpoint, but the company also did a good job from a discretionary spend perspective. And R&D as a percent of OpEx in the most recent quarter is almost 70%, 69.5%. The company is doing a really good job controlling discretionary spend and we are able to do better than that original guidance around $820 million. I think given where we sit today in an environment that's defined by a little bit higher operating expenses, I think, a good planning assumption for us is, is to keep the $820 million as the right way to think about it. This is a company that will always be disciplined around what we do and how we do it. There's no sacred cows and no entitlement to spend. We will be very disciplined around discretionary spend and make sure that we channel those resources to fuel for future growth. But $820 million is the right assumption in the back part of our fiscal year. There's an opportunity to do better. We certainly will.
Harlan Sur: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Your line is now open.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's very refreshing to hear you talking about the rest of the year with, I would say, a good – a nice dose of optimism. It's nice to see that the value chain – seems to be well engaged. And I was just trying to think through what would be the downside risk against your current view. So if you're thinking 2020 could be in line with 2019. That's in the context of still a lot of uncertainty being out there. And to me it's a big uncertainty is end demand and the general micro economic environment. And so I was wondering in a world in which things do not recover in the second half and actually, the macro environment is very difficult, and in particular consumer demand for smartphones, for PCs, for consumer electronics get badly hit. How do you think it's going to affect investment plans of your clients? And maybe another way to put it is in the revenues you see between now and the end of your fiscal year, how much do you think is driven by like the technology train and it's going to happen, it has to go through? And how much could be actually adjusted down if the industry has to scale down significantly on capacity, on manufacturing volumes? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Okay, Pierre let me just try to – there's a lot in there, let me try to hit these. So first I want to just maybe address the framing of the question. When we said profile in 2020, similar to 2019, that was kind of a percent split across device types. I think it's too early to be point specific on the aggregate dollar amount of WFE spend. But what we want to do though is communicate in an attempt to be helpful, communicate about what we see and hear from our customers and what we're see and hear in our business and then extrapolate that towards a view on a market. So what do we see in our business? We see Q1 of our fiscal year our semi-related businesses, SSG and AGS, up 18% year-over-year. Q2 we saw strong demand, but we're actually supply chain limited. Despite that, we were up 13% year-over-year in those two businesses. So the first half of our fiscal year, we're up about 16% year-over-year in our semi-related business. We enter Q3, record backlog in those two businesses. And based on what we're seeing and hearing from customers, we're planning for Q3 to be up sequentially. And then we're expecting it to be up again in Q4. And our view for the fiscal year is strong double digit growth of our systems business. Now, as we think about WFE in the back half of the year, the best framing that I can give you, independent of what we see and hear from our customers because we feel good about our business. What we see and hear, I'm sorry, what we – the best way to frame the back half of WFE, I think, there's going to be two factors that influence WFE in the back half of the year. There's what the customers do and then there's what the supply chain does as it gets healthier. And we know and are aware of the economic, macroeconomic environment. We're aware of what's going on. We see pluses and minuses, cloud, data center, PC, comm infrastructure, are still showing signs of strength. It's offset by softness in things like auto, industrial, consumer, travel, leisure. So we do have that push and pull from a macro environment standpoint and we see those pluses and minuses playing out in the market. Too early for us to decide how that ultimately plays out. Then you have to overlay the comments we made on the supply chain. The combination of those two will influence the shape of WFE in the back half of the year. That said, we feel good about where we sit looking into our Q3 and our Q4.
Pierre Ferragu: Thanks Dan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the…
Dan Durn: Yes, operator if you don't mind, I just wanted to let you know that we have time for just one more question. Thank you.
Operator: No problem. Last question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joe Moore: Yes, thank you. I wonder just in terms of the way that you've characterized the coming quarter, you didn't give guidance, but then you gave fairly specific segment guidance. Can you just talk about the message we should be taking away from that? Is that just that there's the segment guidance, but there's uncertainty around it and why not just guide with a wider range if that's the case?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks Joe. I wouldn't read anything into it other than if we were to go back three months and think about our Q1 earnings call, what we knew at the time was we had a hotspot in China, the rest of the globe was fine. Based on what we saw we de-risked our guide by $300 million and we talked about it being $150 million semi systems, a $100 million in display and $50 million in AGS. And against that backdrop, we executed really well in display and AGS. We fell short in semi systems. And then you ask yourself, why we fell short. There was a concurrent shelter in place order issued for six weeks of our quarter that impacted a material part of the supply chain. That was unknowable at the time we guided a quarter ago. And given the potential for other aspects of this COVID pandemic to spring up in unexpected places, we felt it was prudent to not guide but share in an attempt to be helpful, share what we're seeing in the business. And we tried to strike the right balance between openness and transparency and trying to be helpful without putting a number out there that there's things that could potentially happen we have no control of. We can't execute our way out of a complete shutdown of our supply chain. And nursing it back to health that impacted six weeks of our quarter.  That was an unknowable event at the time we guided. So it's nothing more than trying to strike the right balance between that transparency and prudent in an environment recognizing the elevated macro risk of where we sit today around the world.
Joe Moore: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then in terms of the second half memory spending, I guess when I talk to your memory customers, they're – it's basically sounding like Q2 is pretty solid still, but most of them are conveying a fair amount of uncertainty as to the back half and talking about memory companies not being a leading indicator. And seem to be getting ready for a variety of scenarios. So as you think about that spending pattern, is enough of it technology spending that you feel like this is pretty solid kind of, regardless of the memory pricing environment, or is some of it, I guess – just what's any vulnerability to conditions worsening in the second half?
Dan Durn: So what I would say to that is, is we shared with you what we're seeing and hearing from customers today. I think we recognize that there's pluses and minuses at play in the market. We try to be open about what we're seeing on both sides of that ledger. And what I would say is, is we're just going to continue to be very vigilant at the business. We're going to be ready to respond quickly as the situation evolves. We'll continue to be transparent, and we will let you know what we see each quarter, but hard at this point to call it with precision exactly how that unfolds and profiles in the back part of the year. And so let's take it one quarter at a time and we'll share with you what we see along the way.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you so much.
Michael Sullivan: All right, thanks Joe. Dan, anything you'd like to say before we close the call?
Dan Durn: Sure Mike. I'd like to share our best – I'd like to share our best wishes to everyone who has been affected by the COVID situation. I'd also like to sincerely thank our employees for adapting to a difficult environment and showing strong support for our customers. They've done a truly strong job and we appreciate it. Our company is privileged. It's privileged to pay a big role in enabling the work-from-home and the learn-from-home and enabling those technologies that the world needs right now. We're mindful of the macroeconomic risks, but our business is broader, more resilient than it has in the past. And we continue to see strength throughout the second half of our fiscal year. We will stay close to the investors throughout this situation. Gary and I, we’re going to be at the Bernstein conference in a couple of weeks. I'm going to attend events hosted by Needham, and Cowen and BofA. So we hope to see many of you soon. Stay safe. Be healthy. Mike, let's close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, thanks Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of our call is going to be available on the website by 5:00 P.M. Pacific Time. And we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-02-12 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Applied’s first quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that today’s call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied’s most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today’s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today’s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. I’m pleased to report that earnings for our first fiscal quarter exceeded the top-end of our guidance, reflecting outstanding execution across the Company in a market environment that is strengthening. Based on our calendar year revenues, we believe we outperformed both the markets and our direct peers in 2019. We entered 2020 with momentum, and the signals we see give us increased confidence that the years ahead will be very good for the industry, and especially for Applied Materials. In today’s call, I’ll give you my perspective on how our markets are evolving and provide our near-term outlook. Then, I’ll highlight the key components of our strategy to address the changing needs of our customers and drive sustainable profitable growth for Applied Materials. Before I get started, I’ll take a minute to address the implications of the coronavirus outbreak. To direct a comprehensive response across all the regions where we operate, we quickly activated our business continuity teams. Our top priority is the health and safety of our employees and their families. We’re also doing everything we can to provide our customers the support they need to minimize disruption to their business. In addition, the Applied Materials Foundation is sending medical equipment into Wuhan, and we’ve created humanitarian response fund for our employees in China, and the communities where they live and work. In terms of the business our current assessment is that the overall impact for fiscal 2020 will be minimal. However, with travel and logistics restrictions, we do expect changes in the timing of revenues during the year. We are actively managing the situation in collaboration with our customers and suppliers. While we’re making the necessary adjustments to our near-term plans, we are not taking our eye off the powerful trends that are driving the semiconductor industry forward and creating a structurally larger and less volatile market. At the low point of this recent downcycle in customer spending, which occurred in the second calendar quarter of 2019, the combined quarterly revenues of the top five semi-equipment companies were only 17% lower than at the cycle’s peak. In contrast, during the industry cycles that took place between 2000 and 2013, peak-to-trough revenues for the same five companies combined, dropped on average 44%. Another important metric we look at is equipment intensity or annual equipment spending as a percentage of annual semiconductor industry revenues. Between 1990 and 2014, this equipment intensity metric fluctuated between 17% and 6%. However, when we look at the most recent five-year period, equipment intensity has been in a tight band of 10.5% to 12% with a mean of 11.5%. We believe this is a good estimate going forward and reflects the ever more complex technology challenges we’re addressing and the increasing value we’re delivering to the ecosystem. In addition to the higher growth and lower cyclicality we see in the market as a whole, Applied is demonstrating even lower volatility than our peers. The reasons for this include the breadth of our product portfolio and the balance we have across different device segments. Dan will provide more color on this topic in his section. Moving to our near-term outlook. We see robust foundry/logic investment continuing. There is a strong commitment on the part of these customers to advance the leading-edge as they get ready for demand related to the rollout of 5G. At the same time, we’re also seeing healthy spending for specialty nodes to support growing demand from the IoT, communications, automotive, power and image sensor markets. Progression in the memory market is consistent with the view we’ve shared over the past several quarters. NAND appears to be in the early stages of recovery with prices rising and inventory levels down to 4 to 5 weeks that’s compared to 8 to 10 weeks this time last year. We also see a good setup for DRAM to recover. Encouraging signs include supplier and end-market inventories that are starting to get back to normal levels and prices that appear to have bottomed. These leading indicators bode well for a pickup in investment by memory customers later in the year. Overall, we like the way the market is shaping up for 2020 and beyond. We believe that our semiconductor business can deliver strong double-digit growth this year and feel very good about our longer term opportunities. In display, there are no major changes to the outlook we provided last quarter. We expect FY20 revenues to be similar to FY19 as the industry navigates the bottom of this spending cycle. We still believe that display is an attractive adjacent market for Applied that provides good long-term growth opportunities. The business remains solidly profitable, even as we make the necessary investments to ensure that we have the right portfolio of products ready for when the market picks up. Stepping back and looking at this year in its broader context it’s important to note that the overall electronics industry is in a period of expansion and diversification. Major new growth drivers, including IoT, big data and artificial intelligence are layering on top of traditional demand for smartphones and PCs. As I look ahead, I strongly believe that the future will not be like the past. The emerging workloads that will shape the next era of computing require domain-specific approaches, new system architectures, and new types of semiconductor devices. I believe that we need a new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing to deliver the power, performance and area cost improvements that will unlock the potential of AI and big data. At Applied, we’ve aligned our strategy and investments around this new playbook, so that we can enable new system architectures, new devices and 3D structures, the introduction of novel new materials, new advances in 2D geometric shrinks, and new ways to connect chips together through advanced packaging. Applied has a unique portfolio of materials engineering capabilities and products to enable the new playbook. Getting these new technologies to market faster has never been more valuable. And this is a major emphasis across the company. For example, we’re using advanced metrology sensors, data science and simulation to improve learning rates, speed of the transfer of new technologies from Applied’s labs to customers’ factories, and reduce the time it takes to optimize device performance, yield, output and cost. In addition, we have more engagement with the broader ecosystem than ever before, focused on accelerating innovation all the way from materials to systems. Our strategy is yielding results for our customers and Applied. Calendar 2019 was a new record for our foundry/logic revenues, and the current leading edge node transition further grows our opportunity. For an equivalent number of wafer starts, our available market increases by more than 10%. We’re also generating record revenue from specialty markets where customers build their technology upon trailing geometries. For these customers, the innovation roadmap is driven by materials innovation rather than geometric scaling. Strengthened leading edge combined with healthy investments and specialty nodes means that several of our leadership businesses, including metal deposition and Epi are delivering record revenue. At the same time, we continue building momentum in areas of the market where we still have plenty of room to grow. In the quarter, we secured major application wins for critical etch steps at both foundry/logic and memory customers. Our process diagnostics and control business delivered record quarterly revenue, driven by strong adoption of our new optical wafer inspection system and continued strength in our leading eBeam products. We’re also making great progress in packaging. As the industry introduces increasingly sophisticated packaging approaches, our strategy has been to focus on addressing the most critical process steps. As a result, we’ve been steadily gaining market share. Our packaging business delivered record revenues in 2019 while winning well over 50% of our available market. Another important growth factor for the Company is our service business. Equipment maintenance is an attractive recurring revenue stream for Applied and in calendar 2019, we added more than 2000 systems to our installed base. As I’ve talked about before, we are finding new ways to deliver value through data-enabled services that accelerate customers’ fab ramps and optimize their device performance, yield, output and cost in high-volume manufacturing. As we do this, we’re increasing number of installed base systems covered by long-term maintenance agreements. In the past 12 months alone, we have grown the number of systems covered by these agreements by nearly 15%. Before I hand the call over to Dan, I will quickly summarize. While we’re adapting our near-term plans in response to the coronavirus outbreak, our outlook for 2020 remains very positive. We believe we can drive strong double-digit growth in our semiconductor business this year and significantly outperform the market. We also like the setup for 2021 and beyond. Our markets are better than ever with powerful new growth drivers still only in their early innings. Applied’s opportunities have also never been better. We are uniquely positioned to enable the new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing while helping our customers accelerate innovation from materials to systems. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. Applied Materials returned to year-over-year growth in Q1 with revenue up 11% and non-GAAP EPS up 21%, versus the same period last year. Revenue and gross margin exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and earnings were above the high-end of our range. Our revenue performance was driven by semiconductor systems, which was up 24% year-over-year. We generated nearly $1 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter and returned close to $400 million to shareholders. Our business outlook calls for continued strength in Q2 and our second half. Our relative performance is especially strong. We outgrew the overall semi equipment market in calendar 2019 and we significantly outperformed our closest peers. Applied has made strong investments across our portfolio in recent years. And today, we are larger and more resilient company that performs well in a variety of market conditions. One of Applied’s unique attributes is our broad portfolio, which is more diversified across end markets and more balanced among semiconductor device types, including memory, leading edge and specialty nodes in logic, and packaging. Our portfolio makes us more stable relative to our past and relative to our peers, the closest of which were 50% to 100% more volatile in the recent cycle. Today, our traditional strength in foundry/logic is apparent as we set new quarterly records for overall foundry/logic revenue as well as in metal deposition and process control system sales. Our investments in memory have given us a balanced share profile and this will enable us to continue to generate strong returns when spending recovers later this year. A key pillar of our stability is our aftermarket business, which includes Applied Global Services and our 300-millimeter upgrades and refurbs. Our aftermarket revenue is a product of three drivers, installed base growth, the higher service intensity of new nodes, and our data-enabled service agreements. Our service agreements provide a higher return on investment for our customers and subscription-like recurring revenue for Applied. In Q1, AGS generated record revenue of nearly $1 billion. Our overall aftermarket business also set a new record in Q1 and has grown every year since 2013. Against this backdrop, we’re pleased to be making further progress towards the acquisition of Kokusai Electric, which has an outstanding equipment business, a very large installed base and a highly talented management team. During the quarter, we received regulatory approvals from Japan and Korea. And we grew our cash position by over $350 million as we prepare for the transaction. As a reminder, upon close, we plan to prioritize our free cash flow towards repaying the term loan we’re using to help finance the transaction. We expect to limit buybacks until we’ve repaid the loan. Next, I’ll comment on the near-term environment and provide our Q2 guidance. Since the middle of January, our business continuity team has been working around the clock assessing the needs and capabilities of our employees, customers and suppliers. I’m impressed by the decisive action and compassion being demonstrated by our people across the globe. Our Q2 guidance ranges are wider than usual. And our revenue forecast reflects all of the risk factors we can see today. In Q2, we expect our overall revenue to be $4.34 billion, plus or minus $200 million, which would be up by about 23% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings to be $1.04 per share, plus or minus $0.06. The midpoint would be up nearly 50% year-over-year. Within the outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to be around $3.05 billion, up by around 40% year-over-year. Our services revenue should be about $955 million and display revenue should be around $310 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of around 45.4%, which would be up nearly 2 points year-over-year, and non-GAAP OpEx should be around $820 million. Finally, I will give you some additional color on how our risk-adjusted Q2 guidance compares to the strong underlying demand for our products and services. Absent the near-term risks, our revenue guidance would have been about $300 million higher at the midpoint or up about 30% year-over-year, and AGS revenue would have exceeded $1 billion. While the situation remains fluid, we believe we can address the vast majority of our unmet Q2 demand in Q3 and Q4 and deliver strong growth for the year. In summary, we are seeing very strong demand for our products, solutions and services. We have a broad, diverse and balanced portfolio that is delivering strong relative performance and stability in a variety of market conditions. As Gary outlined, the semiconductor industry is enjoying a new wave of growth, and the equipment industry is growing along with our customers. For Applied’s part, we’re investing in new products and solutions that will accelerate the new playbook and position Applied Materials to deliver superior performance, stable growth and shareholder returns. Now, Mike, let’s begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. Now, I know there are a lot of people on the call today. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and not more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let’s please begin.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. And apologies for the noise in the background. I guess, first question, can you speak to gross margin leverage, as you look forward, particularly around an accelerating service business combined with -- on the tool side where you are mix-wise leadership versus growth, and some of the new products as they layer in? I would love to hear your thoughts around that.
Dan Durn: Thanks, C.J. As we look at gross margins, I think, it’s important to look at the evolution of the business over time. We’re different business today. We’re driving a significant amount of growth in foundry/logic, but we’re also more diversified business than we’ve been in the past. If you were to go back a handful of years, you would have seen us spike highly in the foundry business from a share perspective, and the other three device types were mid-teens. And today, we’re a very-balanced portfolio, and I think that’s served us really well in 2019, both from a revenue volatility standpoint, significantly less than the peers in the industry, but also from a gross margin standpoint, the Company has performed pretty well in the most recent downturn. As we go forward, foundry/logic is going to continue to be a strong market for the industry. The trend line on foundry/logic is up into the right. Every quarter won’t be a record, but we will see an upward trending market, less volatility and higher highs and higher lows. Embedded within that strength in foundry/logic is growth in specialty nodes and technologies as edge devices proliferate. This is a great business for a strong driver of cash flow, strong driver of operating margins. You’re also seeing us in the broad set of markets drive businesses like etch over time. We are making significant share gains into the NAND market followed by DRAM and then foundry/logic, and the Company is performing really, really well, growing that market share. And we’re going to continue to do that going forward. And so, you see an evolution and profile change of the business. You also see our services business going structurally larger. It’s a great source of stable revenues, cash flows and operating margin for the business. And so, we’re a broader, bigger, more resilient business, and it’s going to change the profile of the business over time. As you look at gross margin for the rest of this year, our semi systems business on a half over half progression looks fairly linear, and then you see a growing services business into the back half of the year, and a growing display business into the back half of the year, and all three of those business look positioned to grow well into 2021. And so, where we’re guiding Q2, we expect to be around those levels for the rest of 2020 against this mix profile as we see into the back half of the year. Are we ever satisfied with gross margins as they exist today? No. Are we looking to continually optimize the performance of this Company and drive as much of value for our shareholders? Absolutely. And we’re going to continue to drive as hard as possible at delivering that value. But, I think that gives you a good sense of where gross margin is going to go for the rest of this year and some of the drivers of our business that deliver that result.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. I guess, as a quick follow-up. Can you speak to I guess the improved visibility that you have to memory, and kind of one of the guideposts that gives you the confidence on the second half from foundry over to memory to sustain the growth through the year and into next year? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks C.J. I think, the best way I’d describe the profile and shape of the business in 2020. We’re going to continue to see strength in foundry/logic throughout the year. And we’re seeing early signs of memory recovery today. I think, ultimately what happens in 2020 is really going to depend on the magnitude of the memory recovery later in the year. We posted a really strong fiscal Q1, our guide into fiscal Q2 we see is very strong, and we see that strength continuing into the back part of the year. Again, we’re going to be relatively balanced half-over-half in our systems business. And the ultimate shape of that systems business and strength in the back part of the calendar year is going to be a function of what we’ve been saying for a couple quarters now, which is, it’s going to depend on the magnitude of the memory recovery later in the year. But right now, we feel really good given what we see, fairly balanced half-over-half from a semi systems standpoint. And I think there’s an opportunity to do better in our fiscal Q4 and our fiscal Q1 as the memory recovery begins to accelerate.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. C.J., this is Gary. I’ll add a little bit more color. Certainly, what we see for the year is foundry/logic, NAND, DRAM pretty balanced. And relative to the memory recovery and timing, we talked about the supply and demand, the inventory levels on the prepared remarks. And then, obviously, we also have demand signals coming from our customers. So, that’s really what is driving our comments relative to the way the year is going to shape out, and also the balance in all of those different segments.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and good job on results and guidance. I have a question on the display business. Flattish outlook, not super exciting this year. Gary, does this make you look at some of the disruptive products in the R&D pipeline, like the evaporation or the inkjet tools differently? And if you can share the long-term view on display market?
Gary Dickerson: So display, we still see as a very attractive adjacent market for the Company. If you look at the growth that we’ve seen over the last few years, it’s up significantly. I think, we’re around a $0.5 billion. The business was up over $2 billion, down a little bit this year, but still a very, very attractive market. And certainly, our near-term guidance is impacted also because of the coronavirus. Some of our customers are in areas that are impacted. And so, that reduced our guidance in terms of Q2. But as Dan said, we see the second half of the year being very positive. And we also, if you think about visual experiences and the way they differentiate, different mobile devices, or all of the trillion connected devices that will be happening, will be growing over the next several years, we see that that market’s going to continue to grow. So, 2021, we certainly see the business being up a fair amount over what we see in 2020. The capital intensity is rising as new technologies are adopted. So, we see a good opportunity in our core business. And certainly just like we do in semi, we’re very-focused on enabling customer roadmaps and enabling new structures, new materials for our customers. So, we have those investments that we’re also making in terms of display. We’re making good progress on the pipeline of those new opportunities. Not going to announce anything here on the call today, but we’re still very optimistic overall about the business and also those new opportunities.
Atif Malik: Great. And then, a quick one for Dan. Dan, on OpEx, I know you don’t like to peg OpEx to a ratio. And how should we think about the spending for the rest of the year?
Dan Durn: Yes. I think in the current environment, $820 million a quarter feels like about the right level. You’ll obviously see us continue to drive discipline into our spend. I think, you’ve seen that over time over the last handful of years, operating leverage has delivered some - pretty significant reductions of OpEx as a percent of sales. And right now, R&D as a percent of OpEx is at an all time high for the Company. So, I think the Company is being very-disciplined from a discretionary spend standpoint, and investing the right amount of money to capture the significant opportunities we see in front of us. But, we’ll continue to monitor those opportunities and guide one quarter at a time, but this level feels about right.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. I guess, I would add one thing to that. I think, we’re not emotional over the investments we’re making. We make investments where we think we can drive shareholder value. So, that’s basically the way we look at that this. We do have a point of view. I think, as a leader, you need to have a point of view and courage in terms of how you drive your business. We believe that this business is going to be fundamentally bigger based on AI, big data, IoT layering on top of mobile and social media and PCs. So, we see that that business is going to be larger and the new playbook that I talked about in the prepared remarks for AI and big data is absolutely essential as classic Moore’s Law is slowing. So, we see tremendous opportunities. Applied is in the best position, if you look at the five aspects of that new playbook and we’re going to make those investments. And as I said earlier, 2021 shapes up really well for us, many different aspects come together and we definitely see great growth opportunities going forward. But, we also are not emotional about how we make those investments. So, we’re not married to anything.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on solid results. Gary, you’ve given us a lot of qualitative guidance on semi cap equipment spending for this year. I’m wondering if you can give us a sense of what you think the overall WFE market grows in calendar year ‘20? But perhaps more importantly, how important is China in your mind to that growth? Can you help kind of profile the Chinese spend between sort of memory, foundry/logic? I got to imagine a lot of edge logic stuff you were talking about in your prepared comments is situated in China. But, how do we think about that?
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, John. This is Dan. I’ll jump in and take that. So, let’s break it up into pieces. Let’s first talk about WFE in 2020 and the growth rate over ‘19 and then I’ll come back and talk a little bit about China and what we see in that market embedded in that overall growth rate. So, we think, 2020 is going to be a really strong year for the industry. We feel good about that. The ultimate question around growth rate is a function of what you use as a starting reference point for 2019. So, I’m going to break this up piece-by-piece. Hopefully, I can shed some light and be hopeful to clear up, I think some of the confusion that existed in the market. So, what’s important is, as we establish a reference point for 2019, and then we talk about growth off of that. So we know the number for 2019 WFE. It’s not mid-40s. I think one advantage we have is we’ve got a very broad portfolio and we got insight into all the different device types. And that gives us some unique insights in terms of market sizing. So, let me share with you what we’re seeing, and hopefully we can help out. 2018 was $56 billion. That’s according to Gartner. It’s a good number. It’s validated by a third-party. So, 2018 was $56 billion. Off of that number, we see 2019 down 10% to 12%. And that’s the baseline we’re using for 2020 growth. We see 2020 as a market up 10% to 15% based on everything we see and likely at the high end of that range, given the conversations we’re having with customers. So, while it’s too early to know 2020 with precision. 2019 is very clear as a baseline. So, hopefully now the baseline for 2019 is clear, off of that baseline, we’re likely up 15%. We expect to significantly outgrow the market with our semi-systems business. And it’s not one device type. Coming to China, embedded in that outlook. As we think about 2019 and where that ended? We see that market as about $6.5 billion. And we see growth off of that market of about $2 billion to $3 billion. Embedded within that, if you take a look at that $2 billion to $3 billion, I would say a third of it is 200-millimeter trailing node foundry/logic, two thirds of it is 300-millimeter business. Of the two thirds that’s 300-millimeter business, it’s roughly evenly split between trailing nodes foundry/logic and memory. And there’s balance within the memory profile. And so, I think that gives you a sense of what we’re thinking for the China market. And if I were to take a step back and distill down what we’re seeing. We see consistent, steady, ecosystem building, investments in technology roadmaps with modest capacity additions. And even if we look at the $2 billion to $3 billion of incremental spend that we’re seeing in China, and domestic China, and we take a look at what it costs to build new memory factory, $7 billion, $8 billion, or a new foundry/logic factory of $15 billion to $18 billion even, embedded within that $2 billion to $3 billion of growth, its modest capacity additions. And part of that spend is 200 millimeter, part of it is 300 millimeter with diversification across device types. Hopefully that helps shed some light on both the overall WFE market, john, as well as what we’re seeing in China. 
John Pitzer: That’s great color. And then, quickly as my follow-up, I want to make sure I heard you correctly. I think you said in the prepared comments that for the full fiscal year 2220, you expect flat panel to be roughly flattish, year-over-year which would kind of imply a second half run rate of close to $1 billion if not slightly over. I’m just kind of curious as to why are you confident about that? Is it mainly because the $300 million Cushion you had in the April guidance with a coronavirus is mostly coming out of flat panel or headed by thinking about the math right on that?
Dan Durn: Yes. So, let me start with the math. You are thinking about the math correctly. We’ve had a point of view for couple quarters that revenue in 2020 in the display business is going to be similar to what we saw in 2019. Everything we see in the market today, increases the confidence we have in terms of that outlook. So, no change to the full year guidance. As we look at the risk we’ve assessed as part of the coronavirus, we think we’re taking a -- first of all, we think the risk is temporary and we think there is no change to our full year outlook, fiscal year outlook as a result of that. And so, we think we’re being prudent in derisking our guide by about $300 million and we see recovery of those revenues in Q3, Q4, as we unpack $300 million across our reporting segments. We talked about services, would have been our first billion-dollar quarter, but we’ve derisked it based on the virus. In terms of rank order of the $300 million, first, most impacted is our semi systems business, followed by our display business, followed by our service business. So, if you put the pieces together without being point specific on any one of those, I think you get a sense of how much we’ve derisked our services business, display will be incrementally more than that, and semi systems will be incrementally more than that. The some of those three will equal $300 million. Our thesis around display being -- or I’m sorry, TVs being a recovery market -- or going through a digestion period in the market. You’ll see recovery of the handset market. That framing of the profile of spend in Display still holds. We see both markets looking good into 2021, and we think we return to nice growth profile in the back part of the year and into 2021.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Krish Sankar from Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And Dan, again, thanks for the terrific color on all the industry stuff. Two-part question. Number one is based on your guidance of roughly $3 billion for semis and around the same, maybe plus or minus $200 million for the rest of fiscal ‘20. It looks like when I look at your last cyclical peak in April 2018, you guys did about $3 billion and then the sales trailed off. I understand at the time it was SSG, now with semi systems, there is probably some shift in numbers. But overall, it looks like you can sustain a $3 billion sales number for the rest of the fiscal year. I’m kind of curious from your vantage point, how much of this growth versus the prior peak number was capital intensity going up versus AMAT’s specific share gains? And then, the second quick housekeeping question on your color on China. If I remember right, I think you said 200-millimeter is going to be a third of your number, which is about $3 billion for China WFE. I’m kind of surprised it’s that high, given the fact that last year if I remember right, China 200-millimeter is really $0.5 billion, why is it jumping up so much this year? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Krish. So, taking the second question first, we’ve been talking about specialty nodes, we’ve been talking about trailing node geometries, we’ve been talking about billions of edge devices and intelligence on the edge and sensor technologies that are supporting the buildout of the Internet of Things. And we see trailing node geometries is one place that China can, in the near term, play a strong role in helping to build out their ecosystem in a disciplined way. And so, it fits in with the framing that we’ve been talking about technology development, ecosystem development, and disciplined investments to support that ecosystem from a capacity standpoint. And so, it’s very consistent from a framing standpoint.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. I think, on a -- maybe I can add something on this part of the question. If you look at this market, IoT, communication, auto, power devices, sensors, it has a very, very high growth rate. And innovation is driven by materials innovation. So, 2018 was the first year machines generated more data than people. In the next five years, the forecasts are that machines will generate 10 times more data than people. And when you go to CES, you see everything getting smarter. So, this market is a big market. I think, specifically to your question in China, your numbers are roughly correct. Our numbers are a little bit different, but roughly correct that there’s a lot of growth in China in these areas. And they can build those types of devices. And so, if you look at 1 trillion connected devices at the edge by 2030, the explosion of data and really the transformation of many industries, healthcare, education, you see retail, transportation, all of these areas growing very fast. And the companies that are growing quickly from a market cap standpoint are companies that are data centric companies. So again, I think that’s really what we’re seeing is this explosion of data. And this market is a very big market. Applied has a very strong position. We put together in the last year a team of great leaders across the Company for 300-millimeter and smaller wafer sizes. I personally am meeting many of the CEOs and R&D leaders in this ecosystem. And we have really, really strong momentum. One example is one particular large customer where we won two thirds of the available opportunities in a market that is very, very sticky over a long period of time. So, I think you’re correct in that. Maybe it’s surprising that the market is growing like that. But we think this is really the early innings of these particular markets, IoT, communication, auto power and sensors from a growth perspective. And Applied has a really great position inside that market.
Dan Durn: And Chris, coming back to the first part of your question where you talked about growth and how much of it is share gain versus capital intensity. I think, it’s important to take a step back and set a context around how the Company has evolved over time. If we were to go back a handful of years, we were strong in foundry, over 20% and around mid-teens in all three other device types. Today, we’re balanced across all of the device types. The Company’s made steady progress on that front over the last handful of years since Gary’s took over the Company. Your specific question referenced to time period in 2018. We were high-teens, a little over 19% from an overall WFE share standpoint that year. Today, we’re -- I’m sorry, 2019, we were a little over -- probably a little over 20% in 2019. So, we feel really good about the progress we made and significantly outperforming the peers and the market in 2019. So, you definitely see some share accretion playing out in the current environment. The second thing I would say, our thesis around increasing capital intensity, you see it in the foundry/logic, you see it NAND, you see it in DRAM. That thesis of increasing capital intensity over time is firmly intact. We know our customers are investing a lot of money in WFE. And so, their profitability -- WFE as a percent of their profitability has come down since 2012. WFE as a percent of EBITDA in memory and foundry/logic is down 25% over the last half of dozen years. And so, they’re spending a lot but they’re making a lot of money. And so, the health of our customers is good as it’s ever been. And then, from a capital intensity standpoint, what we see is WFE as a percent of overall semiconductor industry revenue bottomed around 2013 at 9%. Of course we’re taking the one data point around the ‘08, ‘09 downturn of 6% off the table. 2013, it was 9%. And Gary referenced in his prepared comments, we’ve been in a tight band, centered around 11.5% for the last five years. So, it’s a clear indication, this industry is experiencing increased capital intensity. The macro demand drivers driving the overall semiconductor industry are firmly intact. Semiconductors are going to go structurally larger as the data economy kicks in. And by implication, our industry and Applied Materials are going structurally larger. So, we think the opportunities in front of us have never looked as good as they do today, and we are really excited about what we see.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. One way to combat the slowing of traditional Moore’s Law on the manufacturing front, but still drive Moore’s Law like performance improvement at the chip level is through the use of these advanced package, whether that’s chiplet strategy, multi-chip die stacking. You guys have a pretty strong position in these markets. How is this segment expected to do this year? And roughly how big is your advanced packaging segment relative to the size of your overall semi business?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. So, you’re right. We talked about this new playbook going beyond the classic 2D shrinking and Moore’s Law. And packaging is one of those five drivers for the new playbook, and it really, really, really is very important. The one example is, if you take GPU in a new package and this is a product that was released over the last couple of years, you get 50% lower power and 3x increase in speed, 3 times increase in speed just from the package. So, definitely, really important as part of the new playbook. From an Applied perspective, we had record revenues in packaging in 2019 and we have really strong momentum into 2020. We have the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions to support the packaging roadmaps for our customers, and as you talked about, heterogeneous integration approaches. In 2019, we won over 50% of the applications we competed for, and we have this broad portfolio with CVD, PVD, CMP, plating, and etch where we have highly differentiated new products. We have very deep engagement with leading customers. And there’s a lot of focus on innovating with new packaging architectures. Applied has very deep engagements with really across the whole ecosystem. Those engagements are really driven by two things. One, we have the broadest portfolio of current and new products that haven’t been announced yet that are enabling from a packaging perspective. We also have the most advanced packaging lab where we can run entire end to end process and codevelop new packaging technology with leading customers and partners. So again, overall very strong momentum with record business in ‘19. And I think this area -- we haven’t quantified it in terms of dollar amount, but it’s sizable. And I would say relative to growth opportunities and as one of the elements of the new playbook, it’s underappreciated and the opportunities are bigger than what people would think, relative to our growth potential here.
Harlan Sur: Thanks for the insights there. And then, you guys have talked about memory spending recovery, with NAND leading the way this year. But with DRAM pricing now steadily rising, especially in mobile and servers, and looking to be sustainable, and you’ve also got the new gaming console platforms launched in the second half that are driving pretty strong demand growth for graphics DRAM. Are you guys starting to get some visibility on a return to spending by some of your DRAM customers in the second half of this year?
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Harlan. I’ll take that. I think, what we see, we talked about the magnitude of the growth we see in WFE year-over-year into 2020. Our view on that is as it’s broad-based. I think that you’ll see a good profile from foundry logic. I think, you see a good profile from memory and I think you will see balance across device types within memory. The growth profile into 2020 is going to be across those different device types. And yes, we will start seeing DRAM this year.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Harlan. Operator, we still have a number of people in the queue. I’d like to have us please move to one question per person. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu from Newstreet Research. Your line is now open.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi. Thanks, guys for taking my question. On foundry/logic, you had like a record quarter, $1.9 billion. I was surprised -- I was curious to see how much of that comes from deep EUV nodes where a lot of capacity is being added today, [Technical Difficulty] and how much of the revenues are already coming from the new EUV nodes?
Michael Sullivan: Hi, Pierre. This is Mike. Unfortunately, I couldn’t hear. I think you’re maybe on the cell phone. So, we can tell you were talking about foundry and the mix of getting to a number like 1.9. But, we unfortunately couldn’t hear the rest of the details of your question. So, we’re not sure how to respond. Could you try one more time, please?
Pierre Ferragu: Yes. Is it better now?
Michael Sullivan: That is a little better. Let’s try again.
Pierre Ferragu: Okay. Sorry for that. So, I was wondering how much of the revenues from deep EUV nodes where capacity is being added at the moment 7-nanometer foundry and [indiscernible] and 10-millimeter IGM and how much is coming from the EUV nodes ramping today?
Dan Durn: Yes. So, thanks Pierre. Let me take a stab at that and see if Gary wants to add anything. So, what I would say is, we won’t share internal forecast of how foundry/logic breaks out across nodes. But, I think, let me provide some color in context around the $1.9 billion. I think, we would say that we’re seeing strong adoption at 7-nanometers as they build out the node, strong adoption node-over-node as 5 nanometers gets deployed from a capacity standpoint and the logic equivalence of that. And while we talk about a more balanced market in foundry/logic, I think what you would see in the near-term environment that it’s going to be significantly more weighted in the near term to these leading edge technologies. And so, we really like the way the business is performing node-over-node. In fact as we look out into 3 nanometers, we really like the position and we think we can significantly enhance our relative positioning node-over-node. So, we really like the way the business is performing on the leading edge. And what you see in the near-term environment, given the strong ramp around 5 and 7 nanometers is less balance in the market in the near-term, but the long-term trend of diversification within foundry/logic is still intact.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Pierre, the only thing I would add relative to the leading foundry/logic is that all of these customers are driving performance, power, area cost PPAC improvements. And that’s really all about new materials, new structures to drive power and performance. And so, for Applied, as Dan said, really from a leading perspective -- leading node perspective, it’s really -- it is those EUV nodes like 5-nanometer where you see that adoption. But still, we’re achieving record revenue. We have so many opportunities when we’re driving these new structures, new materials, new architectures, all of those different areas. So, we see record revenue there. We’re also seeing growth, not only in transistor interconnect and patterning with some of our leading products, but we also have growth in areas where we have had lower share In etch, we have many new critical etch steps that we’ve won, new soft line multi-patterning wins and EUV patterning steps where we really didn’t participate in the past. So, we look at etch our business in foundry/logic, we are extremely optimistic about the growth that we’re seeing as new nodes are adopted even as EUV is also being adopted as one of the five drivers of power performance area and cost. The other thing I talked about is in process control, we have continued strength in e-beam. We also have strong adoption of a new inspection tool, and we had record revenues in that market this last quarter. So again, it’s really about driving that new playbook along those five vectors, power and performance are leading products. We’re seeing new steps being adopted. And in some areas, we have room to grow, the opportunities for us to have never been better and our position has never been better than today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joe Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could address the $300 million of kind of deferred revenue that pushes to next quarter. Can you talk about why that’s happening? Is that just sort of issues with your customers getting up and running, is it logistics issues getting tools for them, or is it supply constraints that you have getting kind of sub assemblies to build tools? Just can you kind of tell us what’s driving the deferral?
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Joe. I think, the best way to describe it is, the actions China’s taking to contain the spread of the virus has led to travel restrictions and logistics of moving things around the country. We see those impacts as being temporary, and it reprofiles revenue from Q2 to the back part of our fiscal year. And so, in the early stages of the China workforce coming back after the Lunar New Year and after the imposed restrictions by the government, we’re seeing some early signs that are encouraging of some return to normalcy. So, fluid environment. It’s too early to draw a conclusion from it, but we like some of the early indications that we see. We’re going to continue to monitor the situation closely and update as necessary. And again, as we break out that 300, you rank order it, semi systems, display services. It’s about getting our people into the factories and being able to service the equipment. That certainly puts some restrictions on it. We know Wuhan is an important geography in our display business, getting our systems into the factories in that region are impacted in the near term. And then, semi systems, it’s more of the same. And so, we think that given everything we know, it’s a prudent approach to the environment we see. We’re going to continue to monitor it. There’s an opportunity to do better in Q2. We think the customer demand is there, and we do think that we recover in Q3, Q4. And our full year, fiscal year outlook remains intact.
Joe Moore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and for all the color you gave. A lot of questions are asked on the product side. I wanted to ask about services. Were you surprised to see the slowdown in services in the last few quarters? What drove that? And then, more importantly, let’s say, you’re targeting 15%, 20% growth for next year, how much does AGS need to grow for that or how much can AGS grow in that kind of a product growth environment? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. So, as we look at services, we talked about the framework of growth in that business in the prepared comments. It’s size of the installed base, it’s complexity of the leading-node technologies, and it’s the execution against the long-term service agreement opportunity we have. Those underlying growth drivers are absolutely intact. This is a business that’s grown strong double-digits over the last handful of years. Q1 was a record quarter for us and significantly above seasonal. Q2 would have been our first $1 billion quarter. And so, the team is doing a great job executing. We also know the slowdown in the near-term is a function of the memory correction that we’re seeing profile throughout 2019 as industry utilizations come down, our transactional component of the business has reflected what’s happening to industry-wide utilizations. The team is still executing against the long-term service agreement opportunity and grew that business nicely in the mind-teens in 2019. What we like about the setup through the back half of the year and as we look into 2021 with the services business in particularly, as the memory recovery begins to take hold and as we look at that building momentum throughout 2021, foundry logic demand continues to be strong. Those are going to provide a nice tailwind for that business to grow into the back half of the year and into 2021. So, underlying demand drivers intact, team is executing well, and we like the profile going forward.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Just one more data point. I talked about in the prepared remarks. We added 15% increase in the tools under service agreements. And those -- that subscription type revenue is very sticky and also gives us a higher entitlement for tool. So, that’s been a big focus. It’s been a tremendous change in last few years, the significant growth. And it’s really based on the value that we’re providing our customers.
Vivek Arya: Okay. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Vivek. And operator, can we have just two more quick questions, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I guess, I wanted to go through some numbers with you guys. So, you, I think you said a 19.2% of WFE last year. So, if I assume that the second half is flat versus the first flat, that would put SSG sort of in the $11.5 billion to $12 billion range. So, I don’t think you would argue with either of those numbers since that’ what you guided. So, if I use that and then I assume that you don’t gain or lose any share this year, that would imply like a $61 billion WFE number, you’re sort of saying we’ll, it’s probably going to be more like 57. So, if I just average those two and take 59 and if I try to figure how much revenue is required to support that much WFE, and I listen to what Gary said, which I totally agree with about WFE intensity that it usually peaks out at about 12%. So, if you take 12%, that would imply that you need over $500 million worth of semiconductor revenue this year, which would be up like 25% year-over-year. So, I definitely get that line YMTC is some of the incremental WFE, and they don’t have much revenue. But how can you build a path to have enough revenue to support this? I guess, that’s the question. It’s just hard to see WFE growing off of this. It’s going to take a long time for revenue to kind of grow into these WFE levels. Thanks.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, Tim. I appreciate the question. So, a couple of things. We have insight in what we think our Sunday systems business can do against the backdrop of the environment we see. And we’re very confident in our ability to significantly outgrow the market. And then, from a modeling standpoint, here’s I guess how I would get at some of the assumptions. We think 2020 is going to be a really good year. We expect to outperform the market. One of the key variables in the model that you’re putting together is what you assume for market share. And small changes in market share can make big differences in the model. So, we see continued strength from foundry and logic in our business throughout the year. We’ve got signs of memory recovery. And as we’ve been saying for a couple quarters, ultimately, it depends on the magnitude and shape of the memory recovery later in the year. And if we see more momentum in that than we’re currently planning for, then I do think that we have an opportunity to outperform in Q4 and into our fiscal Q1. And so net-net, we don’t see this as being, an isolated pocket of performance. We’re relatively balanced half over half. And we feel really good about our positions and how we’re performing this year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Gary, maybe just a follow-up on the share position for Applied, both in terms of the customer spending mix, which is influential for you, as well as some of the competitive and design wins you talked about, process control being a record revenue year. How do you look at the next couple of years as I guess new products continue to be introduced, and additional competitive wins you believe can drive the Company on this outperformance?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. So, I would say, I’ve never been more optimistic relative to the market. Again, you have new demand drivers that are layered on top of mobile, social media and PC. So, the market is going to be bigger than we’ve seen in the past. And you can also see indications over the last few years the market is structurally larger and less volatile. We have very good share spread across all of the different segments, leading foundry/logic, we have momentum as customers are driving improvements in power, performance, area and cost. In specialty nodes, we have very, very strong positions, whether it’s in image sensors or any of the other markets, like IoT, communication, auto and power, devices. So, we have strength there. We’ve grown a significant amount in DRAM and in NAND relative to market share. Dan talked about this earlier. We’ve grown several points over the last few years. So, we have very strong balance. And what I would say is, again, the path forward for the industry is really this new playbook around new architectures, new structures, new materials, new packages, also where we had record last year and we have strength and new ways to strength. So, we have the product pipeline and we have some very significant products in the pipeline that are targeted at multi-billion dollar types of opportunities. But, the other thing I would say that’s really important is the combination of these different technologies with integrated materials solutions, driving significant improvements in throughput and drive currents or power, the things really that are crucial for the edge and the cloud. We have unique capabilities to combine these technologies, some of them under vacuum. So, you’re not damaging interfaces electrically. So, that’s another area. We have engagements across every single customer with integrated material solutions. We have very good momentum there besides the current products we have and the products that we have in the pipeline. So, again from my perspective, I’ve never been more optimistic. I spend a huge amount of my personal time with the R&D leaders for the customers through this entire ecosystem. They’re struggling to drive the performance, power improvements that are needed. And I think Applied is in the best position that we’ve ever been relative to our ability to drive our opportunities and growth going forward.
Patrick Ho: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks for your question. Dan, would you like to help us close the call?
Dan Durn: Sure, Mike. First, our sympathy is to everybody who has been affected by the coronavirus situation. I want to personally thank all of our employees who are helping their families and their communities while also taking really good care of our customers. Applied’s outlook for 2020 remains really positive. We expect to deliver strong double-digit growth in our semi systems business this year, significantly outperforming our end markets. Looking out into the future, I really like the setup. I really like what I see. Continued strong pull of foundry/logic, improvement in memory, both of those elements are going to drive and fuel growth in our services business over time. I like what I see in display, increasing into the second half of 2020 and into 2021, and we expect to close the Kokusai transaction in the middle of this year. So, I really like the setup in 2020 and 2021. Gary and I hope to see many of you tomorrow at Goldman. And next week, I’ll be on the East Coast and look forward to seeing many of you as well. Let’s close the call, Mike.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, thanks. And we’d like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of our call is going to be available on our website by 5 o’clock Pacific Time. And we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-11-14 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Applied’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. I'm pleased to report our results for the quarter were at the top end of guidance driven by a healthy uptick in demand for semiconductor equipment combined with strong execution across the company. This rounds out a solid year of performance in a challenging environment, as we navigated down cycles in both memory and display. These results would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of Applied Materials employees around the world. I would like to thank them for the passion they bring to work every day and congratulate them on their accomplishments this year.  As this is our year end call, I'll begin with a brief recap of the past 12 months before providing our perspective on the current market environment. I'll then talk about the broader context for the industry, including the major growth drivers and inflections that will shape our markets over the next several years. I'll conclude by summarizing the key elements of our strategy and outlining the investments we're making to put Applied in the best position for the tremendous opportunities ahead.  Applied’s fiscal 2019 was shaped by the first significant pullback in customer investments since 2013. However, this provides a good illustration of how the semiconductor industry is evolving. As I have highlighted before, the market for semi equipment and services is now significantly larger and less volatile than it was in the past. If the second calendar quarter of 2019 proves to be the low point of the spending cycle, then the downturn lasted four quarters and our quarterly revenue at the trough was approximately 20% lower than at the peak.  In contrast, during the industry cycles that took place between 2000 and 2013, our average peak to trough revenue drop was more than twice that magnitude. This cycle was different in large part due to the growth in diversification of demand drivers spanning consumer and enterprise end markets. It’s also important to note that the fundamental dynamics of the memory market are healthier through this cycle. The memory makers are highly focused making disciplined investments in capacity and continuing to drive their technology roadmaps forward. As well as a more robust core market Applied is a more resilient company that's balanced across different areas of the market and can perform well in a variety of conditions. Thanks to the breadth of our portfolio, our semi equipment business is outperforming both the wafer fab equipment market and our direct peers this year. Fiscal 2019 was also a record year for Applied Global Services. In fact, we're growing our services revenue significantly faster than underlying equipment businesses. Over the past 12 months, we've grown our installed base of semi and display equipment by about 2,000 systems to almost 43,000. We have also increased the number of installed base tools covered by long-term service agreement which generates subscription style revenues by around 30% since 2017. Overall, 45% of our FY ‘19 revenues came from sources other than new 300 millimeter equipment sales. This is up from 41% just two years ago.  In terms of our near-term outlook, while I don't want to speculate about the exact shape or timing of the market recovery, I can characterize what we currently see with three observations. First, strong investment by foundry logic customers, driven by demand in key geographies and acceleration of the 5G roadmap and commitment to advance the leading-edge. Second, early signs of a recovery in NAND investments. And third, positive progression of the ongoing inventory correction in DRAM.  Because of the strength seen in recent months, we're revising our estimates for 2019 wafer fab equipment upwards. We now believe 2019 spending levels could be similar to 2017. Based on the visibility we have today, we're optimistic about 2020 with an expectation of sustained strength in foundry logic and a step-up in memory investments during the year with NAND recovering ahead of DRAM.  In display, as anticipated, FY ‘19 revenues were down a third relative to FY ‘18. At this point, we expect FY '20 revenues to be at similar levels as we bounce along the bottom of this market cycle. In this environment, our display business remains profitable even as we fund R&D for next generation products. We still believe the display market provides good long-term growth opportunities for Applied as the industry becomes increasingly technology-intensive. We remain focused on working closely with customers to drive their technology roadmaps forward and ensuring we have the right portfolio of products in place to outperform the market when investment levels pick up.  Looking beyond the cycle at the broader context for the electronics industry, it's important to recognize that we are in a period of transition as major new growth drivers emerge in the form of IoT, Big Data, and artificial intelligence. Over the next decade, we expect hundreds of billions of edge devices to be deployed, and explosion of data generation and new approaches to computing to sustainably process and create value from all the data that's available.  AI and Big Data have the potential to transform every area of the economy and our lives. These inflections will also have a profound impact on the semiconductor industry. As we move from the age of general purpose computing to domain-specific approaches, new system architectures and new types of semiconductor devices are needed in the data center and at the edge. A major factor in the adoption rate of AI will be how quickly we can realize improvements in the power, performance, area and cost or PPAC of the foundational semiconductor technologies.  However, at a time when PPAC improvements are on the critical path, classic Moore's Law scaling is slowing. To drive the PPAC roadmap in the future, a new playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing is needed. This playbook has five main elements, new architectures, new devices and 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink the feature geometries and new ways to connect chips together. Then to accelerate implementation of this new playbook, I strongly believe the ecosystem needs to work together differently by breaking down traditional industry silos. At Applied, we've aligned our strategy and investments around this vision of the future. While we are carefully managing all non-R&D spending, we're investing more than ever in new capabilities and products to accelerate the new playbook.  We recently announced the official opening of our META Center in New York. This state-of-the art facility enables us to work with customers and partners in new ways, accelerating the transfer of novel technologies from lab to fab. I'm equally excited about how our future product pipeline is shaping up. In addition to our traditional unit process equipment, which spans deposition, removal, modification, and analysis of materials, we're developing entirely new categories of products that we call Integrated Materials Solutions. The applications for these IMS products include co-optimization of deposition, removal and analysis, all the way to creating, shaping, modifying and analyzing new structures and devices. We'll share more details as we bring new products to market in 2020 and 2021.  For the time being, let me highlight a few examples of how we are defending our leadership positions, winning new applications and expanding our available market in the near term. In DRAM, customers are introducing advanced transistors and interconnects to improve performance and low power. These technologies where Applied has long held leadership were originally developed for logic applications, and are now migrating to memory. Growing demand for specialty nodes that serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power and image sensor markets is also driving robust investments in capacity and new technologies. PPAC improvements are equally important for these applications. And we're finding new ways to migrate our leading-edge technologies into these specialty markets. Advanced patterning is a critical enabler for shrinking feature geometries, which translates to a large growing opportunity in foundry logic and DRAM. The patterning roadmap is increasingly enabled by new materials as well as co-optimization of materials deposition and removal. As a result, we are expanding our positions in memory and winning new applications at foundry logic customers. And in markets where we have plenty of room to grow, we're also building momentum. In optical wafer inspection, we're winning new positions at foundry logic customers. And in etch, we've recently won multiple critical applications in NAND, as well as in foundry logic, where we delivered record etch revenues for the year. Before I hand the call over to Dan, let me summarize. First, we're seeing a strong finish to 2019, driven by a healthy uptick in foundry logic spending. Although it's still too early to call the shape and timing of the recovery in memory, we're encouraged by the signs we're seeing. Second, we have a strong positive point of view about the opportunities, the AI-Big Data era will create for the industry and Applied. While we're tightly controlling non-R&D related spending, we are investing more than ever in new products and capabilities that put us in winning positions for the future. Third, the technical collaboration between Applied and our customers has never been stronger, and we're working with a broader set of customers and partners to accelerate the time-to-market for new game-changing technologies. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Durn: Thanks Gary. Applied delivered another solid quarter in Q4, with revenue, margins and earnings in the upper-end of our guidance range. I like the way we ended our fiscal year and I particularly like the way we're set up for the year ahead. On today's call, I'll summarize our fiscal 2019, give you my sense of the business entering fiscal 2020 and share our outlook for Q1. In 2019, our end markets were softer across semi, display and the transactional portion of our services business. Despite that, we delivered revenue of $14.6 billion and our quarterly revenue and earnings were stable, which demonstrates the resilience of our broad portfolio, even in a memory correction year. In fact, we earned significantly more in every quarter in fiscal 2019 than we did in all of fiscal 2013, which is the most recent year that included a significant equipment correction. I also like our relative performance.  In calendar 2019, we expect to significantly outperform our core market and our most direct peers. Specifically, while the equipment market will be down by mid-teen percentage, we expect semi equipment plus AGS to be down in the mid-single-digits year-over-year. Looking ahead to 2020 and beyond, we have high confidence in the future growth of our markets and the unique opportunities Applied has to enable our customers’ roadmaps. As a result, we invested a record amount in R&D this year, while reducing our spending in SG&A. We delivered over $3 in non-GAAP earnings per share and generated nearly $3.25 billion of cash from operations. Our capital return strategy is to fully fund our profitable growth opportunities, maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver attractive cash returns to our shareholders through dividends and dividend growth along with opportunistic share buyback.  In 2019, we've returned nearly $3.2 billion to shareholders, equivalent to 113% of free cash flow. We returned nearly $800 million in dividends, raised the dividend by 5% and took advantage of market volatility to repurchase 60 million shares of our stock at an average price of $39.86. As a reminder, we're working to complete the acquisition of Kokusai Electric. Upon close, we plan to direct most of our free cash flow towards repaying the term loan we're using to help fund the transaction. Now, I'll share my thoughts on the business environment. On our previous earnings call, I talked about positive leading indicators of future growth. These included inventory reductions across memory, demand elasticity in NAND and strong foundry, logic demand both in leading edge and specialty nodes. Today, I feel more positive. In semi, we have strong pull for our leadership products, including record demand for epitaxy, a metal deposition. We're also winning many new applications for our high growth semi products in dielectric deposition, etch and inspection. We are significantly outgrowing our markets in foundry, logic, with growing strength of the leading-edge nodes and key wins in automotive and advanced packaging. While it’s always hard to call the timing and magnitude of a recovery in memory, we think it's a matter of when, not if, and we expect NAND to lead the way. In AGS, revenue was stronger than we expected in Q4, and we still expect better than seasonal revenue in Q1. The subscription-like portion of AGS has momentum and will benefit from the thousands of new systems we added to our installed base in 2019. The transactional portion of the business should strengthen as memory utilization recovers in 2020.  Rolling it all up, we are entering the new fiscal year with a backlog of $6.5 billion, which is our highest year-end backlog ever. Now, I'll provide our Q1 guidance. We expect company revenue of $4.10 billion, plus or minus $150 million, which would be up by about 9% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.95 per share. Within this outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to be approximately $2.775 billion. Services revenue should be about $975 million and display revenue should be around $330 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 44.6% and non-GAAP OpEx should be around $800 million. In summary, I like the setup for Applied as we enter fiscal 2020. Our thesis surrounding IoT, Big Data and AI is being validated throughout the ecosystem and our business outlook is transitioning from positive leading indicators to growing demand. The investments we're making in the new playbook are strengthening our product portfolio and driving new design wins that will service exceptionally well as the new nodes ramp across foundry, logic, NAND, and DRAM. Our opportunities in the specialty nodes are also expanding. Our services business delivered a record year in 2019 and is on track for solid year-over-year growth in 2020. Finally, we look forward to closing the acquisition of Kokusai Electric and welcoming its talented team to Applied Materials.  Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Dan. Now to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and not more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: I know you don't want to be too specific around the timing and magnitude of recovery in memory. But I was hoping perhaps you could give just a little bit more color around your product positioning for when that does come, as you look at leadership product as well as some of the new products that you have in the pipeline that you expect to come to market in 2020?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, C.J. So, what we're seeing in memory is customers continuing to drive technology roadmaps this year, even if they're cutting the capacity additions to help with supply and demand. We really like the setup for Applied when memory spending recovers, which we think is in 2020 led by NAND. So, if we look at different types of devices, in DRAM customers are moving to more advanced metal gate transistors in the periphery, and this is going to drive more demand like we saw in 28 nanometer foundry. So, that's really positive for us in leadership areas like Epi, PVD, implant, thermals, also we are gaining share in etch. We're also enabling new DRAM capacitor module capabilities and new patterning technologies that create large new opportunities for Applied where we're reducing the number of steps for multi-patterning and also improving pattern placement. So DRAM, especially with the more logic-like types of steps really plays to our leadership positions. And so, as those nodes go forward, we're in a good position in DRAM.  In 3D NAND, as customers are scaling beyond 96 layers, we're winning new applications with etch and NAND. And as you go to more layers, you need new materials, especially high selectivity hard masks designed in to many of the next nodes as they ramp into a high-volume manufacturing. We also have momentum with integrated materials solutions. One example is in NAND where we do co-optimization of new hard mask films with the sensory etch, the co-optimization increases etch selectivity by about 50% and we're seeing new [DAP] [ph] and etch wins across multiple customers as we enable much better high aspect ratio patterning. So, strong pull across all the NAND customers for new materials, new products, Integrated Material Solutions we're seeing both in NAND and in DRAM. So, we're optimistic we're going to continue to drive strong growth as customers scale to future nodes.
C.J. Muse: If I could sneak in a quick follow-up, like you said we could do a quick one, second one. On the service side, you talked about the excellent growth in your installed base and we're coming off of fiscal '19 [growth of 3%] [ph], how are you thinking about the trajectory from here particularly as utilization rates on the memory front start to move higher?
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks, C.J. This is Dan. I'll jump in and take that. So, the services business is a great growth driver for us. It's been a steady source of revenue growth, cash flow generation. I'd say over the last handful of years, this is a business that's grown at a compound rate of about 15% per year. In the current downturn, current year, memory driven downturn, utilizations following, the business is a low single-digit grower. When you include things like refurbs and upgrades, you're a mid-single-digit grower, so good performance in a very difficult market that's down about mid-teens. As we think about the performance of the business that drives those results, the long-term service agreement portion of the business this year was up mid-teens. It's really the transactional portion of our services business that's fallen with industry utilization and has been a headwind to growth this year. And that's in sort of down 10%, 11%. As we profile into 2020, we really like the setup around our services business going forward. We think we can continue to execute on the long-term service agreements and continue to drive that performance at the levels we've seen historically. And when industry utilization recovers in memory, we would expect our transactional business to transition from a headwind of growth to a growth at or for us in 2020. So we really like the setup and the execution of the team in this environment. We think it sets us up well for 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Good job on the results and guidance. So first, Gary, can you talk about the puts and takes between OLED and LCD in your kind of flattish display outlook at this point? We hear Samsung display is resuming construction of A5 and some [TV fabs] [ph] in China are pushing out. And as my follow up, Dan, if you can talk about the OpEx profile for the remainder of the fiscal ‘20?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Atif. I'll actually take both parts of your question. So as we go to the display market and we think about how 2019 played out, it played out exactly as we expected. We sit down about a third year-over-year and that's where we ended up. Where forecast expectations were set probably three, six months ago, embedded in that was incremental growth off of these levels. And what really drove that incremental growth is as we said solid performance of the TV market into next year and the handset market would recover creating incremental growth for the company. We think the handset market is going to play out exactly as expected. We're going to see recovery in the handset market.  What's happened in the interim in the TV side is, is we've seen several news headlines from some of our customers about delayed investments there's a bit of inventory build on the TV side. Third-party research firm has come out and confirmed what we've been reading about in the headlines. And our customer conversations also confirm this dynamic. And so as we look forward into 2020, we think there's going to be some incremental softness on the TV side that reflects all of the news that's out in the market to date. We expect the handset to recover as we originally expected, and that gets us to flattish profile, similar revenue levels to what we're seeing this year. That's the best way I would describe it.  And then from an OpEx perspective, I think we're going to take this one quarter at a time, we came up to 800. We all know that profiling into Q2 there's the full impact of merit, and we don't get the benefit of the shutdown over the holiday season. And so, maybe that goes up incrementally to 820 to reflect that dynamic. That gives you a sense of where we level out on those, typical seasonal aspects of transitioning from Q1 to Q2 and then we probably hover in that neighborhood for the rest of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Gary, you talked quite a bit about your expectations around new products into next year. I was hoping you could remind us roughly what percentage of WFE you guys serve today at Applied and how that would expand with some of these new products going into 2020 and 2021? And kind of related to that, obviously, you seem to be picking up share nicely in 2019. What are your kind of preliminary expectations into 2020 when you think about your potential outperformance relative to the market? And then I have a follow up. Thank you.
Dan Durn: Hi, Toshiya. This is Dan. On the first one, the percentage of the addressable market that we focus on, it’s going to vary from a year-to-year depending on the spend mix and profile of our customers. But the best way to think about it is, low to mid 60s part of WFE or the markets that we can address in any given year. That's going to vary and change again from a year-to-year depending on that profile mix and I think some of the new products that we end up bringing to market, I think it’s going to help drive our growth in share in the current markets that we serve, maybe there is some adjacencies we begin to look at, maybe it pushes it towards the higher end of the range over time. But it's still going to be in that low to mid 60s zip code depending on any given year and what customers happen to be spending on.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Toshiya, I guess -- and I can also add a little bit of color. I think relative to the different areas where we compete today, definitely we're driving innovations and unit processes around deposition, removal, modification and analysis. We have momentum with some new products and we have some major new products in the pipeline that we're driving. But beyond that, as we've talked about before, you've got AI-Big Data need for 1000 times improvement in performance per watt and classic Moore’s Law 2D scaling not big enough really to meet those needs for a performance per watt. So, we're not only driving unit processes, one thing that we've also been driving are the Integrated Material Solution. We are co-optimizing steps, and even integrating multiple steps in a single system under high vacuum, and we have really strong pull from customers. Again, not just for unit processes where -- again I want to emphasize we're driving very hard with some big new products in the pipeline, some we already see some adoption, early momentum. But beyond that, it's really how do we enable not just materials or removal, how do we create structures, shape structures, modify and analyze structures. And I’ve spent a lot of my time with R&D leaders across our customer base, tremendously strong pull for improvements in power performance and Applied is in the best position, both with unit processes and with these integrated processes to enable the future. So, tremendous, tremendous pull for both of those different areas.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you. And then if I can squeeze one in as a follow-up. Dan, can you give us an update on the Kokusai acquisition? What were some of the regulatory hurdles that you still need to overcome? And then I guess, with the acquisition you are obviously gaining some exposure to batch processing. When you look across your product and technology portfolio at this point, do you feel like it’s complete or is this future M&A still on the table? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes. Thanks Toshiya. I'll jump in on the first part, transition to Gary on the second part. For Kokusai, there's no change in the timing of the transaction. We announced the 12 month timeline when we announced the transaction. We received regulatory approval in Ireland and Israel. We had four other geographies. We're continuing to stay close to the regulators in those geographies. And we like the progress we're making but no change to the timeline from what we announced when we announced the transaction.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, Toshiya relative to Kokusai, we still see it as a great opportunity to expand our markets with batch technology and services to accelerate innovation for customers. So nothing has changed in all of the feedback we're getting from customers versus what we saw at the beginning, relative to the opportunity to create value. Relative to M&A, our strategy really hasn't changed. We continue to focus on three things: a great financial return; synergy to accelerate our customer value and also our growth; and market leadership potential. And we still believe we have a very good organic growth opportunity, so the bar remains very high. And we're not needing for M&A but anything that we look at that fits that criteria, we definitely will continue to investigate and move forward if we find something that fits that criteria.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company, Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: I have two of them, one maybe for either Dan or Gary. I think in the past you guys have spoken about the data analytics talking about two year out WFE, maybe you want to think about it, maybe not. If not, I'm just trying to put numbers around it. If next year, all those being the same as this year if NAND WFE is up 10%, what kind of a growth expectation should you expect for AMAT NAND business, or your semi business?  And then as a quick follow up for Dan. I think you mentioned this in your Jan quarter guidance. Can you give any breakdown between foundry, logic DRAM and NAND? Thank you. 
Dan Durn: Krish, I didn't understand the first part of your question. You said something about analytics. But then I heard you talk about NAND. So I know you're in Europe. Maybe we missed a syllable. 
Krish Sankar: Let me just make it simple. If in 2020, if everything else being equal, if NAND WFE is up 10%, I am just putting some numbers out there, how should be expect AMAT semiconductor business driven by NAND to perform or outperform. And also on the Jan quarter, if you can give a break down between foundry, logic, DRAM and NAND?
Dan Durn: Thanks, Krish. From a WFE standpoint, we don't want to get into guides around next year. But what I would say is, since Gary has come into company, we've become very balanced as a company in terms of our penetration of device types. This is a very balanced company. I think we're seeing the benefits of that in this environment as we inflect from one device type to another. And I think it surged the company well in a time of uncertainty. The company has worked hard, made a lot of investments to create that very balanced portfolio by device type. And so without being specific, I would just leave you with that contextual thought that we're fairly agnostic to how these device types flash in one quarter or another. And I think that gives you some parameters on how to think about things.  From a guidance standpoint, we don't guide by device type, but the thing I would highlight is, next quarter will be a record quarter for us in foundry, logic based on the guidance that we've given. But we typically don't guide by device type.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Gary, just my first question, you guys have done a great job to kind of talking about trends relative to device type. But I hope if you can give update probably just on China for this calendar year? And when you talk out to 2020, how important is growth as far as China relative to your optimism next year?
Gary Dickerson: Our view on China is pretty similar to what we communicated before. The domestic China market is incrementally stronger than our view at the beginning of the year, within the range of what we had expected, but incrementally stronger. And we now anticipate domestic China will be up from last year to around $6.5 billion. Longer-term -- I've been in many meetings and conferences over the last several years, and my message is the same today's as it's been over the last several years. We still expect steady growth in China, so we think next year will be another year of investments. But we don't see hockey sticks. Again what we do is we look at leading indicators for all of the different projects, either domestic or international. And again, our view is again very, very similar to what I’ve talked about the past. We think there's going to be steady growth. We're positive about the market. We're positive about our position in the market. Our share continues to be healthy and accretive to our overall global market share. So, that's kind of a top-level view for China.
Dan Durn: And just to add a couple of things to what Gary said, John. As you think about our planning, we always have base cases, we always have upsides. We will be ready to respond if there is upside to our base case but that's not currently baked into our planning assumptions. And Gary highlighted exactly right. We've been talking for several years now about slow steady development of an ecosystem there, investing in technology roadmaps. We saw it last year. We see a follow through on it this year. We will see a follow through on it again next year and we're not planning for any hockey sticks associated with investments in that geography.
John Pitzer: Then as my follow up Gary, just going back to your comments about foundry, logic looking sustainable going into calendar year '20, I guess just given the recent CapEx raise from TSMC and sort of the implied run rate for calendar fourth quarter, I guess there is a lot of concern in the investment community that perhaps from Q4 run rate levels things will have to come down as you go into 2020. I’d like to hear your view on that. And the foundry weakens in the back half of the next year just because it’s so strong now, do you think logic sort of picks up the slack? Was your comment about sustainability a full year comment or kind of a current run rate level comment? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks, John. Let me jump in on that and give you my perspective. So what we see in the foundry, logic right now, I would consider and characterize as demand led. We had a solid Q4 in the foundry, logic market. Implicit in the guide for Q1 is a record foundry, logic quarter for this company. We ended the year with backlog at record levels. So, the foundry, logic view we see as follow-through into next year and it's not a one quarter phenomenon. There is a strong pull from customers for the tools. It's multiple customers and multiple nodes, which gives us a sense of comfort. We take a look at the foundry market and one foundry customer are well under the ramp of N7, volume production at N7+, N5 and risk production, volume production in the first half of 2020 and N6 risk production in the first half of '20, volume production in the second half of 2020. You could make other similar comments about leading edge technology nodes ramping at other foundry, logic customers exposed to the leading edge. So multiple customers, multiple nodes.  In addition to seeing strength on the leading edge, we continue to see strength on trailing node geometries and specialty nodes, that continues. And while we don't have perfect visibility for the full year, we're very positive on the foundry, logic market over the long run. We are layering in the next wave of compute in the semiconductor industry to complement what is already there in the form of PC demand and mobile compute demand. We've got new architecture sharing data centers, lots of new tape outs, cloud demand is recovering, 5G beginning to kick in. We see a proliferation of intelligent edge devices and auto is growing.  And so as we take a step back, we see the strength continuing into next year. We're really positive about the long run. But as I provide a little more context on 2020, the company is performing well. We talked about the backlog entering the year. We talked about strength in foundry, logic. We talked about AGS set up and looks good as we profile into next year. Swing factor next year for us is timing of the memory recovery. For us, it's a matter of when, not if. And so it's really tough to determine the timing and magnitude of that. And we'll stay close to the market, stay close to our customers. And as new information becomes available, we'll try to be as open and transparent as we can be to help investors. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. 
Harlan Sur: On the better performance in AGS in the October quarter and strong outlook into January, I would assume that the long-term subscription part of the model is very predictable. So was the incremental strength, the transactional business, maybe starting to come back as some of your customer utilization starts to rise, are they bringing back some idle capacity? And if it is that, is it more foundry, logic or memory driven? 
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks, Harlan. You're right. The long-term service agreement part of the business is continuing to chug along. We really liked the performance and that's against the backdrop of a tough market. We talked about the transactional nature of the business, transactional spares last quarter, being bit of a temporary dynamic with a limited number of customers and this is us just getting back to more normalized environment. Clearly, customers are seeing the strength we're beginning to flash in foundry, logic. I think we're seeing some early signs around the setup for memory as we go forward led by NAND and DRAM. And it's hard to really parse against that contextual backdrop, exactly what's in customers’ minds when they drive transactional part of the business. I would just say, in general, it feels like a good setup with some positive momentum. And we feel good about that setup, as we look into 2020.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, and I think the big needle mover is really memory. Memory utilization, certainly the agreement -- the agreements, as Dan said, we’re up to maybe close to 60% of spares and service with agreements where we have higher revenue per tool. But a big incremental driver will be when memory comes back and utilization goes up in those memory factories. And certainly as Dan said earlier, we expect that to happen in NAND first. And as he said earlier, it’s a question of if not when -- when not if. So, it’s definitely going to happen in some time here and we hope the NAND starts in 2020.
Harlan Sur: And when we think between cost per bit declines in memory, both DRAM and NAND, the rate of those declines is decelerating pretty dramatically. So, productivity by your customers is a big focus, more batch-based systems is a focus and one of the drivers for the Kokusai acquisition. But what else is the Applied team doing to help customers improve productivity?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, I talked earlier about co-optimizing hard mask materials with etch to improve etch selectivity. Now that's certainly for the high aspect ratio of patterning, incredibly important. We have other cases where we are working with customers on patterning, while we’re reducing -- I mentioned that earlier, we're reducing the cost of multiple patterning. In some cases, we're able to reduce the cost to 30%, and also enable a better pattern placement. So, for memory, especially in NAND, those are some the areas we're driving. Another area is in the performance with the periphery going to more logic like structures, especially higher speed memory devices, that's an area that plays to our leadership products and certainly we see tremendous traction from customers in those areas. I think longer-term, it's about how do you optimize new structures, creating, shaping, modifying, analyzing new structures. We have a lot that we're doing today in co-optimization of those capabilities. A tremendous amount in the pipeline where we have very strong customer pull.
Michael Sullivan: And operator and the people on the call, I think that we're running a little short on time. We know, there is a lot of people in the queue. I'm going to ask that we go to one question right now and no follow-ups please, just so that we can hear from more of you. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research. Your line is now open.
Pierre Ferragu: Could you give us -- I have heard with a lot of interest the answers you’ve given on your outlook in logic and how you see things evolving? Is there a way you could give us some sense of how you expect or you’re change on two specific nodes, so the one that I have in mind the TSMC nodes, when TSMC moves from 7 nanometer to 7 plus, so some kind of critical dimensions but more EUV in session. And at Intel, between the 10 nanometer node and the 7 nanometer node, same thing, a lot of additional EUV layers. I understand you guys remain very well exposed to this new EUV heavy nodes but I image that when you move from multiple patterning to EUV the type of business you get is different. So could you describe that for us please? 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks, Pierre. So, it’s important to remember that when customers are scaling -- I would say the first thing is that they are driving five different areas where shrinking is one of those five different areas. We talked about new architectures, new structures, new materials, new ways to connect chips together and the shrink. So again, we have tremendously unique technologies enabling that new playbook. And I'm with one of the R&D leaders for one of our customers next week, with another one the following week. Again, constantly, we're getting tremendous pull in driving power and performance because it’s very, very, very difficult. So the first thing I would say is that we have unique capabilities in enabling the new playbook. That's where we're investing, that’s where we have tremendous engagements with customers.  So then if you think about shrinking, I talked earlier on the call about where we're working with customers on multiple patterning. And there are cases where we're able to reduce the number of steps by 30% and increase pattern placements. So that's another area we're doing co-optimization. And it's also important to remember that as you're scaling and EUV layers come in, some other steps also need to shrink and multi-patterning is still growing. So with Applied, the EUV steps that are coming in to replace other steps are not our steps. So Applied has opportunities and we are winning. When EUV is being adopted in some of those replacement steps, there's this focus on multi-patterning where we're focused on reducing steps, reducing costs.  I think another -- Pierre another really good example is in 2019 in foundry, logic, we have very strong momentum with our sensory etcher. And this is where you're seeing the highest EUV adoption. We're seeing very high growth in 2019 with wins across many customers, and we definitely see significant growth, much faster than the market with our sensory etch business in leading foundry customers. And we anticipate based on the wins that we have, we're going to continue to grow at 5 and 3, as these new technologies are being adopted. Just another data point with Sym3, that's the fastest ramping product in the history of Applied, we just shipped our 4,000th chamber, and many of them going into foundry and logic. So that's kind of a top-level view. I would say, again, the key thing for all of these customers is how do they drive the technology roadmap for power and performance. 2D scaling is slowing down, they need new ways to drive the roadmap, and that's really the sweet spot for Applied Materials.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open. 
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Gary, if think you just provided a little bit of color already to the question I have. But with capital intensity trends for foundry and logic continuing to increase, as we go from 7 to 5 and eventually 3, aside from say like the etch Sym3 and products like that, where else are you seeing I guess increasing capital intensity trends on the foundry, logic that helps both your leadership tools, or your leadership businesses, as well as some of the growth opportunities? Aside from the etch, are you seeing it in deposition, are you seeing it in the process control area? What other areas are you seeing that growth in capital intensity trends from your products?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question, Patrick. So if we look at 2019, we talked about a record foundry, logic performance. And we have a very strong incumbent leadership position, as you talked about in foundry, logic; a much larger business and more diverse business than our process tool peers. And that's driving our outperformance in 2019. So if we look at foundry, logic, in this calendar year we will have the highest foundry, logic revenue ever, highest Epi revenue ever, and highest metals revenue ever. So, those are areas that are part of our leadership products. We are working with customers on new materials like tungsten deposition, shaping structures with selective removal where we are gaining key wins. That's enabling performance gains for our customers and growth for Applied. So those are some of the areas where we are seeing growth. In terms of 2019 we're also see strong growth besides etch, in CVD, thermal. And you talked about inspection, that's an area where we just introduced a new product. We are seeing very strong adoption and that will give us momentum to grow quickly in that business in 2020. So, anyway, that's a little bit of color around some of the areas that we're driving. But it really does get back to driving power and performance area and cost for customers and really more and more, not just with unit processes, but also with these integrated solutions is a sweet spot for Applied and gives us tremendous momentum going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Dan, I just had a question on gross margin guidance. There's hardly any incremental drop through year-over-year, yet you are doing like $350 million more in revenue but gross margin is the same. I guess it's a little surprising because SSG which is the highest margin segment is up a lot year-over-year. So, are SSG margins lower in January, because it seems like the margins at a corporate level should be 150 basis points higher something like that. So can you just walk me through that? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Sure, Tim. We won't guide gross margins, but let me -- by segments. But let me share with you a little bit of what we do see in gross margin. As you know, gross margin in any given quarter, so it’s going to be a function of a few things, revenue level, segment mix, product mix, customer mix, factory activity. All are going to vary from quarter-to-quarter and go into the gross margin. We think our performance compares favorably with our peers ever this cycle. Our peak to trough gross margin over this cycle was down about 210 basis points to our next closest competitors in the process tool space. One was down 300, another was down 310. And as we were profiling into the back part of the calendar year on a relative basis, I think that gross margin performance on the quarter-over-quarter basis also looks pretty good. So, we like how are executing. Are we ever satisfied with our gross margins? No. Are we maniacally focused on driving improvements and improving the cost structure? Absolutely. We are going to keep at it. We are going to continue to work hard and I think you are seeing breadth and depth of our portfolio in a broad sense play out in the gross margin resiliency over the course of the cycle. 
Michael Sullivan : Hey, thank you for asking the question, Tim.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya : Thank you for taking my question. Just thinking conceptually about next year, if foundry, logic sustains and memory is really incremental to the model, and I think you're starting at a low level, but just a run rate implies that your growth through the year. Does that say your January quarter is the low point of the year in terms of sales and gross margins?
Dan Durn: I'm sorry, Vivek, could you please repeat it. It cut out on this end. I just want to make sure I got the full question, sorry.
Vivek Arya : Sure. Yes, of course, Dan. So if memory spending is incremental to the model from here on, and you said foundry and logic should sustain, and even on the display side, I think you're starting at a low point in January, does it say that your January quarter outlook is the low point of the year in terms of sales and gross margins that things could actually conceptually get better in the year as memory recovers.
Dan Durn: So I guess, the best way for me to describe it, because I think what we're going to do is we're going to guide one quarter at a time, and the environment is clearly better today than it was a quarter ago or six months ago. And what I would say just at the very highest level, companies performing well. We've got a good backlog entering the year. You pointed out strengths in foundry logic services, swing factor in the year. I said it before, it's really the essence of the issue, the swing factor for the year is going to be what happens in the memory market. So we're going to stay close to customers, we're going to be ready to respond when the NAND market starts to hit, followed by DRAM. And we'll take it one quarter at a time. So I don't think we want to start giving multiple quarter guidance and shaping the full year given some of the uncertainty we see from a timing standpoint on when things like memory are going to start to flash.
A - Michael Sullivan : Thanks Vivek. And operator, we'll take one more question, please.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton : And I guess I just want to follow-up on John, and the next question's there just, it seems almost illogical for us to assume that the foundry strength that you're seeing in the January quarter sustained at that quarterly level through each quarter of fiscal '20, so that would get the business up probably well into the teens, if not 20%, year-on-year, and so again I guess not asking you necessarily guidance quarter-to-quarter, but isn't it logical to assume that you're probably not going to sustain that peak quarterly revenue at foundry in every quarter of 2020? Thanks.
Dan Durn : Yes, no question, Quinn, and my sustainability into next year is really meant to be that it's not going to be a one quarter phenomenon. We've got a nice backlog, Q4 was a really nice quarter for us in foundry, logic. Q1 will be a record quarter, and I think it would be probably not the right place to set expectation to think every quarter is going to be at a record foundry, logic level. And so while the activity level can be nice, it doesn't always have to be a record.
Michael Sullivan : Okay, great, well thank you, Quinn. And I think we're almost at the end of our hour. Dan anything you would like to say in closing.
Dan Durn : Sure, Mike. Just a couple of quick thoughts, first like I said at the beginning, I'm pleased with the way we ended the fiscal year, and I especially like the setup for Applied in 2020 given a record year-end backlog and the momentum that we see in key parts of the business. Second, we look forward to staying close to investors. December 3rd, Gary and I are going to be at the Credit Suisse Conference in Scottsdale. Next week after that I'll be at the UBS Conference in New York. In the meantime, we hope you all have a happy and safe Thanksgiving with your families. Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.
Michael Sullivan : Okay, great. Thanks, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of our call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific Time. And we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference calls. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-08-15 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Applied's third quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. Our results for the third fiscal quarter demonstrates strong execution in an environment that remains challenging for the time being. Overall, our view of 2019 is consistent with what we've previously communicated. Within our served markets, foundry and logic spending is strong, while investments by memory and display customers are significantly lower than last year. We also remain mindful of the broader macroeconomic risks. During this industry down cycle, my primary focus is ensuring the organization is executing on the initiatives that will put Applied Materials in the best position for the future. I believe the opportunities for Applied are compelling as powerful new demand drivers emerge in the form of IoT, big data and artificial intelligence. So even though we are prudently managing discretionary spending in the near term, we are fully funding R&D to accelerate customers' roadmaps and building new products and capabilities that will underpin the company's growth in the years ahead. In today's call, I'll begin with a brief update on the near-term market dynamics, I'll then talk about emerging technology trends and Applied's strategy to address them, then I'll finish by highlighting some of our recent accomplishments. Starting with the current environment. Our views of the semiconductor and display markets are largely unchanged. In memory, spending has softened slightly since our May call. On the supply side, we still see customers making disciplined investments, while adjusting factory output to reduce inventory levels. On the demand side, we believe the price elasticity of NAND is starting to take effect in the form of increases in the average bits per box for both smartphones and PCs. Based on our current visibility, we remain optimistic about 2020 with an expectation that NAND investments will recover ahead of DRAM. In foundry logic, demand has strengthened as the year has progressed as we see customers accelerating the ramps of their leading-edge nodes. Demand for specialty nodes that serve the IoT, communications, automotive, power and image sensor markets is also driving robust investments in capacity and new technology. Taking these factors into account, our view of overall wafer fab equipment spending for 2019 remains the same, down mid- to high-teens on a percentage basis relative to last year. We see 2020 as a more positive set-up for the industry and Applied with the start of a recovery in memory investment and sustained strength in foundry logic spending. In display, there are no significant changes to the outlook we provided last quarter, and we still anticipate our 2019 revenue being down by about 1/3 relative to 2018. Just as in semi, we're excited about the inflections taking place in display and the opportunities these create. We're getting ready for the future by ensuring we have the right portfolio of products to help our customers accelerate the introduction of next-generation technologies, including rigid and flexible OLED and larger substrates for manufacturing. A few weeks ago, Applied hosted our second AI Design Forum with more than 700 attendees, representing leading companies from across the ecosystem. My main take away from this conference is strong alignment around 4 key themes. First, AI and big data are driving new approaches to computing that require new system architectures built from new types of semiconductor devices. Second, at the time when improvements in power, performance, area and cost are paramount, classic Moore's law scaling is running out of gas. Third, to address this, new approaches for semiconductor design and manufacturing are needed. In our view, the new industry playbook has 5 elements. New architectures, new devices in 3D structures, new materials, new ways to shrink feature geometries and new ways to connect chips together. Fourth, to accelerate implementation of the new playbook, company's need to connect and work together differently by breaking down traditional silos. At Applied, we're aligning our strategy and investments around this vision of the future. For example, new types of memory, including MRAM, PCRAM and ReRAM I high potential technologies that can enable new architectures and provide significant PPAC benefits at the edge and in the cloud. But these 3D devices are also incredibly challenging to make at high volume and yield. In the case of MRAM, the devices based on a film stack of more than 30 thin layers, some of which are only 8 atoms high. Missing atoms or imperfections in materials have a significant impact on the performance and endurance of the device. To help drive adoption of these advanced memories, we recently introduced one of the most sophisticated products we've ever created, combining many of our leadership technologies in one integrated system. This new system has 9 different wafer processing locations and each process chamber can deposit up to 5 different materials. The entire process flow takes place under ultra-high vacuum to keep impurities out, and we use cryogenics and heat to vary process temperatures by hundreds of degrees. All of this is critical to optimize material, structures and interfaces. The system also includes unique onboard metrology that allows us to measure key properties of the materials to 100 of a nanometer as they are being created and modified. This next generation of equipment that we call Integrated Materials Solutions is one of the ways Applied is bringing to bear our broad technologies and capabilities to address our customers' most complex challenges. Another area where Applied has unique technology and breadth is advanced packaging. Applied has the most comprehensive portfolio of solutions to support customer's advanced packaging roadmaps and new heterogeneous integration approaches. In the past quarter, we won an important process tool of record positions at leading customers, securing over 80% of the applications we competed for, including CVD, PVD, CMP, and etch where we have highly differentiated new products. Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is also yielding results with our unit process tools that enabled new 3D structures, the introduction of new materials and new ways to shrink. For example, we've been building on our strength in conductor etch for memory by winning new steps in both DRAM and NAND, as well as new positions for critical etch applications in foundry logic. We're also finding new ways to deliver more value to customers through our service business. One example of this is using advanced metrology sensors, data science and simulation to speed up the transfer of new technologies from Applied's labs to customers' factories, and then reduce the time it takes to optimize yield, output and cost. While growth in Applied Global Services is slightly below our prior expectations, we still anticipate our combined spares and service revenues being up this year, even as customers pull back on their capital spending and operating expenses. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Our view of 2019 is relatively unchanged. Thanks to the hard work of our employees across the company, we are delivering solid performance even with the current weakness in memory and display demand. During this industry down cycle, we are focused on driving R&D programs and building new capabilities that will move the needle for customers and Applied in the AI era. And we remain excited about our long-term opportunities as these powerful secular demand drivers start to take shape. Now Dan will provide his perspective on our results and outlook.
Daniel Durn: Thanks, Gary. In Q3, Applied delivered solid financial results with revenue, margins and earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. Our semi-related business continues to feel stable. And while I'm still not ready to call the bottom of the cycle, I see positive leading indicators of future growth. In memory, our customers reported significant output reductions during the quarter. They discussed inventory reductions in their end markets and demand elasticity across smartphones, PCs and servers. In foundry logic, demand is strong, both in the leading nodes and in trailing geometries driven by IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensor applications. We believe our markets will become significantly larger as powerful new demand drivers kick in, and we're positioning Applied to generate strong shareholder value by focusing on our 4 financial priorities. One, we are tightly managing our overall spending. While two, fully funding and expanding our product road map and customer technology engagements to fuel growth. Three, increasing the recurring revenue we earned by helping our customers maximize their returns from the installed base. And 4, delivering attractive cash returns to shareholders. For example, this quarter we held overall spending flat but increased the R&D portion of non-GAAP OpEx to 69%. This outcome demonstrates how we are controlling our discretionary spending, while fueling innovation and future growth. We announced plans to acquire Kokusai Electric to expand our presence in the batch technology and accelerate innovation for our customers. This will also strengthen our services and customer support capabilities in the memory markets and throughout Asia. And we delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders, including while the Kokusai transaction is being reviewed. During the quarter, we paid $0.21 per share in dividends, including the 5% increase our Board approved in March, and we used $528 million to repurchase over 12 million shares at an average price of around $42 per share. Over the past year, we've repurchased 68 million shares at an average price below $39, and we have $2.4 billion remaining on our buyback authorization. In short, we're excited about our opportunities, and we're focused on taking actions that will generate significant shareholder value in the years ahead. Now I'll summarize our Q3 results. We delivered company revenue of $3.56 billion, and non-GAAP gross margin of 44%, both above the midpoint of our outlook. We held non-GAAP OpEx to $746 million, and generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.74, which was near the top end of our guidance range. Turning to the segments. Semiconductor Systems revenue was $2.27 billion, which was above the midpoint of our outlook, and non-GAAP operating margin increased to 27.5%. Global services revenue was $931 million, which was below the midpoint of our outlook, and non-GAAP operating margin declined to 27.8%. I'll take a moment to explain what we're seeing in AGS. Last quarter, I explained that we have 2 kinds of service business, long-term agreements that give us subscription-like revenue and transactional parts and services. In Q3 and in our outlook for Q4, long-term service agreement revenue is growing right in line with our forecasts. But our transactional business is being impacted by the output reductions in memory. We still expect a record year for AGS, but we're lowering our growth target to low single-digits. Revenue from our overall semi-installed base business, which includes parts and services, along with upgrades and refurbs, will grow even faster and set a new record. Moving to display, Q3 revenue and operating margin both declined slightly as we expected. Next, I'll provide our Q4 guidance. We expect company revenue to be approximately $3.685 billion, plus or minus $150 million, and we expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.80 per share. Within this outlook, we expect Semiconductor Systems revenue to be approximately $2.25 billion. Services revenue should be about $955 million. And display revenue should be around $455 million, which would be up 34% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 43.5%, and non-GAAP OpEx should be about $755 million. Looking ahead to 2020, we continue to expect growth across our markets and a gradual U-shaped recovery. While we only guide one quarter at a time, I'll offer you some planning assumptions for the early part of fiscal 2020 to help with your models. On a quarterly basis, we view $2.2 billion as a good baseline for Semiconductor Systems revenue until we see evidence of a recovery. We expect AGS revenue to be flat with our Q4 guidance, which is a bit better than seasonal, and we expect display to be about flat with our Q4 guidance, which demonstrates our expectation that we've passed to the bottom of the display cycle. Gross margin should remain approximately flat versus Q4 on the mix we foresee, and OpEx should increase to around $800 million as we layer in the annual merit increases, along with R&D for new products and the new technology initiatives Gary described. In short, we see structural growth in the years ahead, positive leading indicators for 2020 and the opportunity to drive strong shareholder value by investing in breakthrough innovations that Applied Materials is uniquely positioned to deliver. Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore.
Christopher Muse: I guess, first question, in your prepared remarks, you talked about expectations for NAND to recover sooner than DRAM. And so, I guess, on that front, how are you thinking about that coming back in terms of both timing and magnitude? As well as, as we move from single stack to multi-stack and there's clearly clean room availability, how are you thinking about conversions versus new capacity as that comes online into 2020 and beyond?
Daniel Durn: CJ, maybe I'll start and see if Gary wants to offer anything from a technology standpoint towards the end. So when we think about the memory market, and you called out NAND specifically. But let me broaden the comments just a little bit more to encompass the entire memory market, we don't expect to see a recovery in 2019, we see it as a 2020 event. And as you pointed out, we expect to see NAND first then followed by DRAM. If we think about where we sit today from an overall WFE standpoint, the memory markets are clearly down in 2019 versus where we were in 2020, so this is clearly a correction year. But we are seeing early signs of improvement. Output across the industry has come down, we are under shipping true end market demand from a supply standpoint as we exit the year. This is bringing our customers inventories down, it's bringing our customers' customers inventories down, and we do see the early signs of demand elasticity beginning to kick in and signs of price stability. When we met all of this together, we definitely see 2020 as a recovery year in the memory market. And again, we see it as a NAND-led event followed by DRAM. In terms of magnitude, I think it's premature to be point specific on any individual market right now into 2020, but we like the setup of what we see. When we take a step back and we think about the long-term in these markets beyond 2020, we do see that there is a data explosion as the data economy kicks in and the value of that data is increasingly going up as companies learn how to monetize it. We see capital intensity going up. We see new forms of memories, which really plays to our strengths in materials. We see our customer base being rational and disciplined. We met all that together, we think there's a real opportunity to go structurally larger as a memory market off of the levels we're currently seeing in the current environment. So we feel good about the long run.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Maybe I can add something relative to our position in memory and also in NAND. I think many of you know that we have a much more balanced overall share across memory and foundry logic. In memory, we increased our share of total spending from less than 15% in 2013 to around 20% today, and we're confident we're going to continue to drive gains into the future. Another thing that's really positive for Applied is memory is very much driven by materials-enabled scaling. And I think everyone's aware, capital intensity has been increasing. We are also engaged with all the major memory companies with Integrated Materials Solutions. Again, it's all about new structures, new materials, how far, especially in NAND, you can scale vertically. So we have very strong pull from customers for new materials, new products, to enable their cost and performance road maps. In NAND, specifically, we're winning new etch applications in NAND. And to get more layers in NAND, one of the most important things is new materials, especially high selectivity hardmasks where we have very strong capability. I talked last quarter about hardmasks that increased etch selectivity by 50%, and we are seeing strong adoption of those new capabilities across multiple customers with new steps that give us significant TAM growth. So again, we've been increasing our share in NAND, we have new materials and new products that make us very optimistic. We're going to continue to drive strong momentum into the future.
Operator: And our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Congrats on the solid exclusion. Gary, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China from a technology progression perspective, both on the DRAM side as well as the NAND side. It continues to be a pretty big part of your business as well as your peers' businesses in the near term as well. So if you can talk about the rate of progress on the technology front as well as your expectations in terms of WFE for 2019 and preliminary thoughts on 2020? That will be helpful, and I've got a follow-up.
Gary Dickerson: So our view on China is similar to what we communicated before. We don't see any major inflection in spending. 2019, we see relatively flat versus 2018. If you look at domestic China, our view is a little stronger over the past few months with some increases in memory. For the year as a whole, we see slightly higher spending on foundry logic versus memory. With foundry logic focused on IoT, communications, sensors, those types of devices. In our -- in display business in China, we believe that's going to be down roughly in line with our global display forecast. Overall, in China, we have a great position, semi-service, we've been in China for 35 years, the display is a great team for us, very, very strong customer relationships and engagements. Relative to the technology progression, I don't really think, again, anything has changed from what we communicated before. As I said, we believe the foundry logic on the trailing nodes is where we will see over half of the domestic investment this year. We think that market is going to continue to grow. If you look at image sensors, that's going to be a very strong market, and we see the investment there, it's being rational and in line with the increase in demand for those types of products. Memory is a -- those are very difficult technologies, and it's a long road to be able to produce those technologies at a competitive level for performance and cost. As we've communicated before, we don't see any big hockey sticks. I really don't see much different than what we saw before. We think it's going to be a long journey and incremental spending going forward.
Toshiya Hari: Great. And as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about market share. If we take your October quarter guide for the Semiconductor Systems business and the guide from Dan into the January quarter, I guess, we get a calendar '19 segment revenue number that's slightly better than what you described for overall WFE. Is the slight market share gain implied in your guidance a function of your SAM acting a little bit better than prior years? Or are you actually picking up share within the markets that you serve?
Gary Dickerson: Toshiya, so there's no question, 2019 is a more favorable setup for Applied. And I have really very strong confidence that we're in a great position to keep the momentum going into the future. If you look at the third-party data for overall spending, you'll see that we've been on the trend of higher or flat share, all the way back to 2012, except last year where the mix was very heavy in places like batch processing, dielectric etch, litho where we don't participate. So absolutely the mix is more favorable for us this year, so we are not going to make any specific predictions, but the set up for sure is much better for us this year. We're winning many head to heads and especially in applications. We have a very strong pipeline of new products, including products that expand our positions into the markets that we don't currently serve.  Some of those products are already gaining traction with major customers. I spent a lot of my time with the customer and R&D leaders, that's what I love to do more than anything else. And in discussions with them, it's clear that they're struggling to deliver improvements in power, performance and cost. I think it's also clear, and this was evident at the AI Design Forum last month that the future's not going to look like in the past, the classic 2D scaling isn't working. And all my interactions with R&D leaders, they talk about new materials, 3D structures, new ways to connect chips together, new ways to drive costs. And I really deeply believe, Applied is in the best position we've ever been in to enable this new playbook with the breadth of products we have to create, shape, modify and analyze new structures. Our combined capability is unique, enables us to deliver Integrated Materials Solutions, we talked last year about 1,000x improvement in leakage current, we talked this year about this amazing MRAM capability, and those are new ways to drive performance and power performance area and cost. And also, we're currently engaged with all major customers in memory and foundry logic with these new integrated material solutions. So that combination of new IMS solutions, our capability to enable the new playbook, new products, put us in a great position to accelerate roadmaps for customers and drive future growth for Applied. So again, I'd like the setup for 2019 and also into the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi.
Atif Malik: Good job on the execution. Gary, a couple of memory makers have talked about CapEx being down for next year. You sound optimistic on NAND and your peers have said the same. How do you reconcile these 2 and what is your view based on the recovery in memory pricing or share availability?
Daniel Durn: Atif, this is Dan. I think I'll jump in and take this. So all we can bake into our forecast and the expectations we set into the market are the things we see, the conversations we have with our customers about expectations out into the future as well as the bottom modeling we do from an industry and end-market device standpoint and the consumption of bits in those boxes as well as top-down economic modeling and forecasting. And as you can imagine, our forecast comes together. It's a triangulation of those events, but we spent a lot of time talking to customers and based on all of the information that we have to date, our best view out into the future is for 2020 to be a recovery year in the memory market and for WFE to be up year-over-year. That said, in this environment, we are setting an expectation, and we think it's prudent to do this, setting an expectation for gradual U-shaped recovery. If the industry does better than we're currently contemplating, then we, as a company, will benefit in a very material way, and we like that setup. But when we net it all out, to us, it's a matter of when, not if. And in our view, it's a 2020 event for memory.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Congratulations on solid results given all the uncertainty in the macro. Gary, wondering if you could spend a little bit more time talking about the market opportunity for sort of the N minus 1 at the foundries being driven by industrial, auto, IoT. How big do you think that is? And I guess, importantly, with trailing edge nodes staying stronger, longer, what does that do for reuse of the foundries at leading-edge? Is that actually driving a bigger end spend because reuse is slowing down?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Yes, I think, for sure, we see that this, especially market growth, is going to continue to increase for the future. If you think about -- people talk about a trillion connect to devices and generating significant amounts of data, that's right, smacked at the middle of that type of market. And this is a really great growth opportunity for Applied. We have a great portfolio of products across 200- and 300-millimeter technology. If you look at foundry logic, again, maybe some people don't understand the dynamics, about 50% is growing in areas like IoT, communications, auto, power devices and sensors and innovation there is really driven by materials innovations. So again those are areas where Applied has a significant strength. We've increased focus on these markets, and we have a great team of leaders across the company to work with customers to enable their road maps. I mean, I personally have visited a lot of these key customers over the last 2 or 3 months, tremendous pull for the technologies that we're developing. I'll give you one example of a situation that happened this last quarter.  We won 2/3 of the revenue opportunities at a major customer in this specialty market where the selections are very sticky over many, many years. Once you're qualified, you're in for a long period of time. So again, that was a case where in terms of the spending, we were winning a huge percentage of those opportunities, and this is, again, all about materials, innovations and structures, and we have a lot of technologies currently that are unique for these particular markets, and we have an increased focus there in developing new technologies. Our culture is really focused on being the preferred strategic partner for all of our different customers, enabling their technology roadmaps, enabling their future for those different markets. Going forward, this is a great opportunity for us to partner with these customers, the breadth of technologies combined with Integrated Materials Solutions, I think really puts us in a really good position.
Daniel Durn: And, John, just a follow-up and add a little bit to what Gary said which talks about reuse and the implication that has for spend on the leading-edge, I do think we're seeing a different pattern evolving the industry. When I walked in the front door a couple of years ago, I think we had a point of view on what the total capacity footprint in 28 nanometers was for the industry, and that has gone up significantly in the last couple of years. We're looking at mature nodes. And the way the industry used to work, as you know, you'd introduce a new node, you'd have a big investment cycle to put the capacity statement in place, and then you'd see the investment level falloff on that node. And then our customers would opportunistically look to reuse equipment as they build out the next node. I think what we're seeing is investment profiles, many years after the introduction of the node, being much larger than we've seen historically and I do think that, that's going to impact the rate of reuse as these more mature nodes continue to grow in size relative to our original expectations. So we really like the way the industry is broadening and diversifying, and the implications that has long term on the attractiveness of this market for us.
John Pitzer: Just quickly, as my follow-up, I know you guys only guide one quarter out, but you give us some sort of sign, color for entering fiscal '20, which would suggest that revenue and gross margin kind of flattish at these levels, but OpEx is going up. I'm just kind of curious, are you clearly signaling to us that margin start off a little bit weaker in the fiscal year 2020? Or are these more rounding errors? But if it's the former, when do you start to reestablish kind of operating leverage in the model?
Daniel Durn: John, so just a little perspective on how we view OpEx and operating margin and maybe the commentary gets at the point that you're asking. So this is a company we're very focused on increasing operating margin percentage over time. I think what you saw in the most recent quarter is a very disciplined approach to the OpEx. We're compressing discretionary spend, and we're channeling more of our OpEx towards the R&D engine, things that are going to fuel growth at the company over time. And so 69% is a record high for the company, and we feel good about that discipline. What you see profiling into Q1 is the annual merit increase that we get every year, but it's also a statement around the opportunities we see. Moore's Law is hitting a wall, Gary has talked about a new playbook that is going to increasingly define the power performance road map of this industry that creates an enormous set of opportunities for us.  We are going to invest in R&D, we are going to drive growth and drive leadership into this industry over the next decade as it fundamentally inflects and drives the power performance road map in a very different way than we've seen historically. The way -- from where we sit today, we expect our semi business to be up year-over-year. We expect our services business to be up off of these levels year-over-year, and we expect our display business to also grow into next year. And as the industry recovers, and we take our company structurally larger, I think you're going to see the operating margins expand as we grow the company and the investments that we're making today to drive that future leadership should allow us to outperform as that industry recovers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Nice job on the quarterly execution. On the strong sequential growth outlook in display in Q4 and the sustain levels into early next fiscal year, can you guys just help us understand the mixed large-screen versus mobile OLED? And how do you see that mix as we look at into next fiscal year?
Gary Dickerson: Sure. Absolutely. Yes. So let me give color on the display business and this gets at your question. As we said in the prepared remarks, we still see this play down about 1/3 versus 2019. We don't guide display fab equipment, but this is basically what customers are telling us about next year. We see 2020 for Applied being higher than 2019. We also expect TV investment to be roughly flat next year, many of these are Gen 10.5, there are long lead times, and so we have pretty good visibility into that part of the market. And we do expect mobile OLED to increase as a percentage of the overall market next year. So we do see the overall display business being up next year. Longer term, we believe the markets still going to be cyclical, but we've continue to be optimistic about the market based on trends, including TV size and build-out of Gen 10.5 that's going to take many years, the mobile OLED conversion and eventually innovations like RGB OLED TV, foldable smartphone, all of those different areas. For Applied, the adoption of OLED, I think many of you know, is also more capital-intensive. So as those technologies are adopted in more types of devices, that's good for us from a capital intensity standpoint. We're also investing to drive new products to expand into very large TAM growth areas. We're not to give any more color today about those specific products. But again, the pull from customers is still very strong, and we're making progress in those areas. Together, take all this together, we see good opportunities to drive growth in our display business into 2020 and beyond.
Harlan Sur: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up to one of the prior questions. On your new MRAM and storage class memory PVD platforms, just given the increase in content and microcontrollers, in IoT industrial and automotive applications and a growing need for higher embedded memory density for MCU. Seems like there's just as much opportunity on legacy semi MCU processes as there is for high-performance storage class memory architectures, has the team tried to size of the SAM opportunity here for your two new platforms, sort of looking out over the next 2 to 3 years?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question. So we think this market is going to start small. It's around $100 million for us so far. But as you mentioned, it's very strategic in future customer applications. We see this type of device moving from lower flash replacement to bigger applications like L3 cash replacements, especially DRAM replacement. Again it's not something that's going to ramp overnight, but we do see incremental growth in the market. And then I think for us, when I was at Semicon and AIDF, this was one of the things for me, personally, I was most excited to talk about. Because when you think about these new devices, I think many of you know, it takes many, many, many years to go from a single structure that you publish a paper with certain kinds of performance to making billions of those devices at the right cost, high yield, speed, power, endurance, all of those things. And so talking about the system that we had at Semicon, you have all this amazing technology into 1 Integrated Materials Solution and ultra-high vacuum. You have a structure like an atomic layer 3D printer almost, where you're -- you have a structure with more than 30 layers, some only 8 atoms high, 10 different materials, temperatures on the wafer that range about 500 degrees C and ability to measure the key properties of the materials as they are being created to 100th of a nanometer. And all of this, all of this is really critical to optimize the material structures and interfaces. So again, certainly, the better you can drive the performance, yield, reliability, the more applications you can win and the faster the market ramps. And so what we're excited about, and certainly, the companies that we're working with, they're very excited about, is being able to scale a technology like this into high-volume, high yield and right cost and right performance. So again, we see this market small today but certainly, relative to future compute architectures, it is very, very, very important.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: I had a question on service, I don't know if, Gary, you want to take it or, Dan, you want to take it. But if I look at July, service was like $60 million light in July. And then October, you have been saying kind of like high single digit for the year. So that would imply that the October number is like coming in at about $150 million light of what you thought it would be. So that's like a $200-million number over a 6-month period. And so that's like 10% of the entire AGS segment revenue. But I think you had also said previously that the spares and service part of AGS is like half of the revenue. So really, it's like 20% of the spares and service portion. So I get the memory production cuts, but that's a huge number for a business, but I think people consider to be quite stable. And I think your peers are sort of seeing a little bit better trend there. So I'm wondering if you can talk about that.
Daniel Durn: Tim, let me share with you a little bit of my views about the business and hopefully, it gives some color and perspective. If we take a look at our services business, this is a business that the team has really tuned strategy, we've got a great strategy. Strong execution over the last, call it, 4 years, it's a business we've grown at a compound rate of about 15%. Last year, we grew it at over 20%. This year, expectation coming into the year was high-single digits. As we look at underlying components of the business, there's an element of the business that's long-term service agreements that's more subscription-like, and its revenue. As we look at performance of that business in Q3 and Q4, it's profiling exactly like we thought. And so a mid-teens grower into Q3 and Q4. When we look at the other part of the business, the other half of the business being more transactional, spares and service related, that has a connection to industry utilization and factory outputs. Clearly, we saw a falloff in Q3 and Q4 as the memory industry has structurally brought down its factory output to work through the induced -- inventory correction. We initially thought this was going to be of flattish business for the year, it now looks like it's down low double digits for the year. The combination of the mid-teens grower and down low double digits gets you a low single digit grower as an overall business if we were to classify our business similar to others in the industry. In addition to growing low single-digits, added our 300-millimeter refurbs and upgrades to the business. This is an all-time record year for us, and it's something that's growing quite a bit stronger than the segment reported services business. So I wouldn't necessarily look at our absolute performance or relative performance and think that there's something deficient in the way the business is profiling. We think we've got a great business, the team is executing well and as industry utilization recovers into next year, should provide a nice leg of growth to the business going forward.
Gary Dickerson: Maybe just let me add a little bit color on the service business. As Dan talked about, certainly, there's been a reduction in wafer starts and you also mentioned this in the question with memory customers, so that's impacting the spares parts business. But one thing that's been a major change in our strategy, starting in 2013, was to drive more subscription-type revenue with customers, and that's been very successful. If you go back to '13, we had net 0 adds in terms of -- and service contracts. Since then, that part of the business has been growing very, very fast, Dan talked about even in this year with WFE down a fair amount, that part of our business is still growing at a very high rate and that subscription revenue from longer-term agreements is now larger than our transactional spares and service business. And that's really because we continue to see strong pull from customers, accelerating R&D, accelerating fab rams, optimizing yield output and cost in high-volume manufacturing. We also have a very strong strategy in data analytics. We have over thousands of tools connected in customers' fabs, that's creating value for customers today and that creates a great opportunity for us to continue to drive that data-enabled strategy to create value for customers and also to drive growth for Applied. Just one more data point, if you look at our spares and service business, and again, this is separating out upgrades, refurbishments and other things that are counted by some people, if you look at just our subscription revenue and our spare parts business, transactional business, that business has grown 27% over the last 2 years with wafer fab equipment being flat. So that shows that even in a case where wafer fab equipment is not growing, that service business is growing. So we're very optimistic that we're going to drive this business at a high rate going forward, at Applied, and also create more value for our customers.
Timothy Arcuri: Awesome, Gary. Just as follow up, there was a major memory maker in China running around Flash Memory Summit. They were talking about spending $10 billion on WFE between 2019 and '20. Very, very big numbers that I don't think anybody's modeling. Can you talk just more generally, about China memory efforts and whether next year could be a pretty big year from the indigenous China guys?
Gary Dickerson: We're not really giving any color on 2020 right now. I think what I had said earlier on the call relative to '19 is that we see '19 relatively flat with '18. And I honestly, don't see a big hockey stick. I've said this to pass over the last few years also, haven't seen a big hockey stick, I think that the spending certainly in foundry logic is rational around IoT sensors, communications all of those kinds of devices. That's a little over half of the domestic spending this year and certainly, we believe that there will be some incremental spending but we're not going to give any color on the call today relative to forecasting 2020 for China.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.
Krish Sankar: I have two of them, Dan, given that the semi business is stabilizing at the revenue levels, but the mix is shifting more towards foundry logic versus memory, I would have thought your gross margin performance has been better? Can you give us how to eliminate some of that and what's going on the gross margin side? And then as a follow-up, I'll ask it right away. You guys gave some color on FY '20 display revenues relative to 2019. Given that the deal was 9 months late on visibility, how should we think of FY '20 just relative to FY '18 where you did about $2.5 billion?
Daniel Durn: Thanks, Krish. Let's take them into order. First, on the gross margin and the foundry logic showing signs of strength. Let me start by saying this is a company that's laser-focused on driving those margins up over time. And if we we're talking about the business mix from may be a few years ago, I think maybe we'd be seeing incrementally higher gross margins. But let me help you a little bit with some of the mix factors that we see going into gross margin given who we are today. So as we take a look at our services in display business and growing it as a part of our portfolio, we know that those two businesses, and we've done a great job growing them, those two businesses have a gross margin that's lower than the corporate average, but we expect each of those businesses, and we expect each of those businesses to be up as we look into 2020. And then within our semi portfolio, our leadership businesses are doing really, really well, but the profile of our semi business is changing as we grow. And there's a couple of things I would point to. First, our etch footprint. These are gross margins, products with gross margins that are not as high as may be other parts of the portfolio, but we're doing a great job driving that business, we're expanding that business into new opportunities and beyond memory in the foundry logic. And that certainly changes the profile of our business as we grow forward. Second thing I'd point to, and we talked about it on this call, is foundry logic spend diversifying. There was a time a decade ago when it was 90% on the leading-edge, and then it evolved to 80-20, 60-40%. And now for, the last 3 years, '17, '18 in '19, it's fully split 50-50 between leading-edge technologies and trailing node geometries.  And where we compete in the trailing node geometries with differentiated equipment and our key enablers of some of the technologies and products that are being brought to market, that's super attractive business for us. But there's also opportunities in that market where we compete with 300-millimeter refurbs, 200-millimeter systems. And while those products offer really attractive operating margins and cash flow, the gross margins might be a little bit lower than we see in some of the other businesses we pursue. So we're going to continue to stay focused, we're going to continue to drive gross margin over time, particularly as we see the industry recover, we drive revenue higher from this point going forward, we do think we're going to be able to grow the semi business into next year, grow the AGS business into next year and the display business. So we're going to stay focused on execution, and we feel good about how the business is profiling. Yes, and then the second part of your question was on display. Could you repeat the question? I apologize, I lost...
Gary Dickerson: Yes. I can do it. Basically, on display relative to 2020, what we said earlier as we think 2020 is going to be a little higher than 2019. I don't think we're going to give anything more specific at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya: I think, when you started the call, you mentioned that you're still not comfortable calling the bottom. And I'm curious, what in the environment is preventing you from doing that? Is it order visibility? Is at the macro environment? And what do you see -- what do you think your memory customers will start to add incremental capacity?
Daniel Durn: Vivek. I think, I'll come back to the comments we made a little earlier that in an environment defined by what we see today, we do think it's an elevated risk profile around some macro environment -- around the macro environment as well as geopolitical, I just think it's prudent in an environment that's characterized like the one we're in to set expectations in a modest way. We have conversations with customers, if I would give a direct read through on those conversations, I think you would see expectations set at the different level. But again, and come back to environment like this, I just don't think that's a prudent place to be. So we want to set expectations in a more modest way. We're setting expectations for gradual and U-shaped off these levels. Certainly, if the industry recovers faster than where we're setting the expectations given our broad portfolio and how we're positioned in all of the markets, this is a company that's going to benefit in a very material way if that happens. So we feel good about the position, we feel good about finding stability in the business and we do think it's just a matter of when, not if, and we'll be ready to take advantage of those opportunities when they materialize.
Vivek Arya: Okay. And as a quick follow-up. On the market share side, I know last year, you guys were down 2 point -- but you're starting to recover that in recent quarters, heading into 2020, which areas do you think AMAT is best positioned to gain share? And what will be the impact of EUV in that share progression and how is that impacted?
Gary Dickerson: So if you look at EUV, we still see Applied growing in patterning and we also see a growth in overall WFE, even as EUV find areas of adoption. As we've communicated before, last year, EUV was a headwind. As we look forward, you have to look at different segments. EUV has a very small impact on memory. When memory recovers, that's going to be very positive for Applied relative to the TAM opportunity. Memory is really about materials enabled scaling, and we have gained share in memory, very deep engagements with our customers and good opportunities to continue to drive share gains. In NAND, we have a great opportunity to enable 3D scaling, I talked about new hardmasks. Our etch position continues to grow. And DRAM, they're adding metal gate in the periphery, and this is where we have high share as those processes are adopted. I talked earlier about IoT communications, sensors, that's an area where I talked about. We won 2/3 of the TAM opportunity here recently with a customer, and that's about 50% of the foundry logic spending.  So we have momentum in all of these different areas. And then other thing I would say is that we've talked about this new playbook. New architectures, new materials, new structures, new ways to connect things together and new ways to shrink. We really have new technologies and new products in many of those different areas. And so I've given color today on the call about many of those different opportunities, and that's also why we're investing more going forward. We have a very strong point of view. The market driven by AI, big data is going to be strong in the future. We believe that the new playbook, with new structures, new materials, new ways to connect to devices, all of those areas are areas where Applied has unique technologies, unique capabilities, we have products that, some of which are already seeing adoption with customers where we have traction, we're going to invest in those areas. And my main focus as CEO is to make sure we're in the right position when those markets grow in the future.
Michael Sullivan: And we're getting close to the end of our scheduled time. So Dan, would you like to help us close the call?
Daniel Durn: Thanks, Mike, Sure. Let me just share a couple of quick comments to end the call. First, I'm encouraged. I'm encouraged by the stability we're seeing in our business. I'm encouraged by the positive leading indicators that we're seeing in memory. But I'm still not ready to call the bottom, especially given the macro risks that we need to keep an eye on. At the same time, we've been in this industry a very long time, and long enough to know that something new and big is happening in computing, and it's happening just as Moore's Law is slowing down. So we see growth coming, and we believe Applied is in a special position to help this industry. So we're going to invest, we're going to create value and grow this company and outperform the market. And finally, we're going to stay close to investors, Gary and I, we're going to be hosting some meetings here in Santa Clara throughout the quarter, and I personally look forward to seeing many of you in the beginning of September in New York at the city conference. So Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thanks, Dan. And we like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available on our website by 5:00 Pacific time, and we would like to thank you for continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-05-16 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and answer-session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Hello, everyone, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our second quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings with the SEC. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On Tuesday, July 9, Applied will host a Technology Day for the financial analyst community and other industry participants. The events will take place in San Francisco beginning at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Gary Dickerson will be joined by other CEOs and technology leaders from throughout the semiconductor, hardware, software and data center ecosystem. We hope you'll join us, and we'll be in touch with invitations in more details. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Mike. In our second fiscal quarter, we delivered results toward the top end of our guidance range, reflecting solid execution across the company in a challenging business environment. Overall, our outlook has not changed significantly since our February call. Investment by memory and display customers remains muted for the time being, and we continue to pay attention to the broader macroeconomic risks. Looking further ahead, we maintain a strong positive view of our markets as powerful new demand drivers take shape. We're excited about the opportunities these secular trends create for Applied and while we are carefully managing discretionary spending consistent with current market conditions, fueling our long-term growth remains a top priority. We're focusing on driving R&D to accelerate customers' roadmaps, building new capabilities and positioning Applied to play a bigger and broader role in the AI, big data era. In today's call, I'll begin with our latest perspective on near-term market dynamics, then I'll talk briefly about the future growth drivers that are reshaping the semiconductor and display industries, as well as the implications for Applied. And I'll finish by describing our performance and strategic priorities. Starting with the near-term environment, our view of 2019 is largely the same as it was at the start of the year and shaped by two key factors. First, the semiconductor industry is in a period of diversification. If you look back over the past five years or so, you will see that smartphones drove the majority of semiconductor capital investments. We believe that is changing. As we transition to the AI, big data era, major new drivers are emerging that will fuel industry growth for years to come. Although we're only in the early stages of the build-out, we see the combination of cloud data centers, 5G infrastructure, IoT and automotive technologies underpinning a much more significant portion of wafer fab equipment spending in 2019. The second major factor impacting this year ahead is the memory cycle that the industry has been navigating for the past several quarters. Recent data shows that NAND pricing is stabilizing and inventory levels are down from their peak, although they still remain above normal levels. DRAM is not as far along in the correction cycle, with high inventory levels and prices still falling. As I've said before, I believe this memory cycle is different from those of the past. The fundamental dynamics in the market are healthy, with disciplined investments in capacity. This year, customers are focusing resources on advancing their technology roadmaps and overall memory spending will be down significantly from 2018. We expect inventory levels to normalize as the year progresses, creating a more favorable environment for capacity investments in 2020. In foundry/logic, we have seen customers' plans firm up over the past few months and now expect spending to be up year-on-year. In aggregate, our view of overall wafer fab equipment spending in 2019 is unchanged. We still see spending down mid to high-teens on a percent basis versus last year. In display, the picture is also consistent with our outlook from last quarter. We are still anticipating that our 2019 display revenues will decline by about a third from 2018's level as customers push out investments. Over the longer term, we maintain our view that display is an attractive market, which is becoming more technology-intensive and increasingly dependent on materials innovation. The introduction of larger substrates and TV manufacturing, as well as rigid and flexible OLED technologies for mobile applications creates important growth opportunities for Applied over the next several years. Even as we work through this period of softer demand, I believe it's critically important we do not lose sight of the bigger picture. Major new industry growth drivers are emerging in the form of IoT, next-generation communications, big data and artificial intelligence. These technologies are disruptive and transformative, and will touch almost every area of the economy and our lives. From a semiconductor perspective, we believe the AI, big data era will be characterized by two major inflections. The first is a computing architecture inflection towards AI workloads as we move beyond general purpose computing to specialized systems designed for new applications in the cloud and at the edge. The second is overcoming the deceleration of classic Moore's Law scaling to deliver system level improvements and power, performance and cost that will unlock the full potential of AI and big data. We see a new industry playbook for semiconductor design and manufacturing emerging that includes five key components: new architectures, 3D structures and scaling techniques, novel materials, new ways to shrink feature sizes and advanced packaging including new ways to connect chips together. We see Applied's breadth and depth as a key strength as we collaborate broadly to address the technology challenges that will enable this new playbook. Our strategic priorities are to accelerate innovation for our customers while finding new ways to create sustainable value with our technology. I'll highlight four important ways that we're doing this. First, we are building new capabilities. We're creating powerful R&D platforms like the META Center in New York and advanced packaging lab in Singapore to complement our existing beta and technology center in Silicon Valley. In parallel, we are leveraging state-of-the-art sensors in metrology combined with data science, machine learning and simulation to reduce product development cycles and speed up transfer of new technologies from lab to fab. Second, we are developing entirely new types of products to address the most complex challenges in the chip manufacturing process from the introduction of novel materials to key integration bottlenecks. Some of our key areas of focus include critical deposition implant and edge processes to scale current memory structures. The introduction of novel materials combined with sub angstrom-level control of those materials that are needed to enable new memories including MRAM, ReRAM and PCRAM, new materials and interface engineering to enable significant improvements in power efficiency and performance at leading-edge foundry/logic nodes and next-generation advanced packaging for heterogeneous integration. Our product pipeline spans from new unit process tools, all the way to Integrated Material Solutions or IMS, where we can combine multiple processes together with customized metrology within a single system. Third, we're expanding our engagements across the AI ecosystem to accelerate innovation from materials to systems. In July, we will be hosting another AI Design Forum, bringing together leading companies in the field to support deeper collaboration between system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community. I hope that many of you will be able to join us for this event. And fourth, we're building a more resilient company that performs well and could continue to fuel innovation in a variety of market conditions. For example, increasing our focus on our service business has been a great way to deliver additional value to customers, while providing a revenue stream that is relatively decoupled from industry cycles. We expect Applied Global Services to deliver high single-digit growth this year, even in an environment where semiconductor and display customers are trimming their capital spending. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Despite soft near-term demand, the company is delivering solid performance. We are prudently managing discretionary spending and relentlessly focusing on our R&D pipeline. We expect 2020 to be a more positive set up both in terms of industry spending and how much of that spending Applied can address. And we remain highly optimistic about the longer term. As powerful new drivers for semiconductors and displays emerge, we see tremendous opportunities for Applied Materials. Now Dan will provide his perspective on our performance and outlook.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. In Q2, Applied delivered solid financial results in a challenging environment. While we are still not ready to call the bottom of the semi equipment cycle, I believe our industry thesis is very much intact. New demand drivers are taking shape. And even in this memory correction year, wafer fab equipment spending could be $10 billion higher than the peaks of all the prior cycles. In this environment, I'm focused on four financial priorities: carefully managing our overall expenses, fully funding our new product pipeline, maximizing our recurring revenue and delivering attractive cash returns to our shareholders. I'll share my thoughts on each one. First, in Q2, we reported OpEx of $745 million, which was below the midpoint of our guidance. It was also below our spending in Q1, which included a holiday shutdown and only one month of this year's merit increase. We'll continue to keep a tight rein on discretionary spending. Second, at the same time we're fully funding R&D. As Gary described, our customers need more innovation than ever to improve chip performance, power and cost. We're investing in unique systems that enable new architectures, materials, 3D design techniques and packaging, in addition to 2D scaling. Third, in addition to strengthening our competitiveness in the near-term, these investments will increase our installed base and give us more opportunities to earn recurring revenue well into the future. I'll give you some metrics to think about. You may know that Applied has the largest installed base in the industry of more than 40,000 systems. Many of our systems have multiple chambers and we actually have over 140,000 chambers in the field. Helping customers maximize the installed base is a key opportunity for Applied, especially in a year like 2019. This year we expect to generate about 40% of our semi-related revenue from the installed base, which includes 200 and 300 millimeter upgrades, refurbs, parts and services. The most strategic pillar of the AGS growth strategy is long-term service agreements, which allow us to deliver the most value to our customers and generate subscription like revenue for Applied. Today more than 20% of our semi-installed base is covered by long-term agreements. This business needs to be earned and we do it by generating recurring value to our customers in the form of faster ramps, higher yields, greater throughput and lower costs. Our strongest growth comes from advanced services where we use data science to help our customers achieve maximum performance and continuous improvement. Our renewal rates are world-class. 2018 was the first year when AGS generated over 50% of services and spares revenue from subscription like agreements. In 2019, we expect to grow the subscription part of the business at about twice the rate of the segment as a whole. Finally, cash returns. As Gary said, the memory correction we are seeing today is different from those in the past. For our part, we are still generating solid profitability and more cash flow than we need to support the business. In Q2, we generated operating cash flow of $800 million and we returned $814 million to shareholders. We paid $189 million in dividends and we announced a 5% dividend increase. We were opportunistic with the buyback program, using $625 million to repurchase approximately 16 million shares. In fact over the past four quarters, we've repurchased 8% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of that period. Over a five-year basis, we bought back approximately 28% of the shares. Looking ahead, we're excited about the industry and confident that the actions we're taking today will generate substantial shareholder value in the years ahead. Now I'll summarize our Q2 results. We delivered company revenue of $3.54 billion, which was slightly above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 43.5% and in line with our outlook as the revenue upside was relatively balanced across the segments. We held non-GAAP OpEx at $745 million and we generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.70 which was the top of our guidance range. Turning to the segments, semiconductor systems revenue was $2.18 billion and slightly above the midpoint of our outlook and non-GAAP operating margin was 27%. Global services revenue was $984 million, which is a new record and demonstrates how well we are growing the business even in a correction year for the industry. AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 28.8%. Display revenue was $348 million, which was above the midpoint of our outlook as some of the systems scheduled for Q3 actually shipped before the end of Q2. Display non-GAAP operating margin declined 10.1 points sequentially and we expect the margin to recover along with revenue in the upcoming quarters. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and investments and nearly $3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Next, I'll provide our Q3 guidance. We expect the company revenue to be approximately $3.525 billion, plus or minus $150 million, and we expect non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.75 per share. Within this outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to be approximately $2.175 billion, services revenue should be about $990 million, display revenues should be around $335 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to increase by about 30 basis points sequentially and non-GAAP OpEx should be approximately flat sequentially. Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. Now to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and not more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess to follow-up on your commentary regarding 2020 and more favorable capacity spending environment, can you walk through how you're expecting the mix there, what the implications would look like to your market share? And how we should think about silicon operating margins bouncing off the current lows of the 27% and whether we should be thinking at least over time we can get back into the mid-30s. So I know a lot there, but I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thank you.
Dan Durn: Thanks, C.J. Let me start with the overall market profile and then what we expect from a margin standpoint as we roll forward into 2020. So as we take a look at where we sit in 2019, we talked about the overall WFE being down mid to high-teens. Our view on that hasn't changed. That puts us in about a mid $40 billion range for WFE this year. As we look at the profile across device types and you look at foundry/logic and you look at memory, we think foundry/logic is going to be up a little bit this year, we think memory is going to be down a good amount this year. That gives you a bit of a setup on how we're profiling in 2019. As we roll the clock forward and we look at how WFE is likely to unfold in 2020, we view this as a growth year in WFE. As we look in the foundry/logic space and we have advanced purchases of things like EUV in metrology systems around advanced nodes, we see the capacity adds building out those nodes going in 2020 beyond and we think that's a favorable setup for our overall markets. On the memory side, we don't see a memory correction this year and we do see the memory correction profiling into 2020. That is our current expectation. If it happens faster than that, then we will benefit in a material way. The combination of the setup around foundry/logic and memory going into 2020 is a favorable setup for Applied and we feel really good about the position that we're in. As we take a look at operating margins. Operating margins are going to be a function of two things, how we profile from a gross margin standpoint and how we invest to fund future growth and deliver key enabling technologies to make our customers successful. Gross margin in any given quarter, not surprisingly, will vary depending on product mix and customer mix and factory activity levels as well as aggregate revenue levels, and it's going to vary from quarter-to-quarter. As we look at the investments we are making today, we see 3D scaling and Moore's law increasingly having challenges, we see the road map, and Gary has talked about this in the past, there's a new playbook that our industry is going to create to drive power and performance for our customers. Applied has a key role to play in each of those elements of the new playbook, whether it's materials or architectures or 3D structures or packaging, and we're going to position our business and invest in our business to lead going forward. Now that said, in an environment where you see recovery in our end markets and our ability to grow into those end markets, we fully expect to see leverage on both the gross margin and the operating margin line. Premature at this point, I think, to give a point estimate on 2020, but we like the setup around 2020, and we do think we will see leverage in our margin structure as the business returns to growth.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, C.J. thanks for the question. Let me start with 2019, and then I'll go to 2020 and beyond and build on some of what Dan talked about. While we're not going to forecast 2019 share on the call, we do think 2019 is a more favorable setup for Applied. While we still see additional EUV adoption in 2019, the non-EUV spending mix is more favorable for Applied than it was in 2018. And going forward, I believe that we are very well positioned to drive share gains. Customers are struggling to deliver improvements in power, performance and cost. And as Dan said and as I've talked about many times, it's very clear a new playbook is needed based on new 3D structures, new materials, new ways to drive costs and new ways to connect chips together. A great example of our new playbook is our potential to enable a 1,000x improvement in leakage current. And there are other enabling capabilities that we have to address – power, performance and cost – that we're not going to discuss in public. We're engaged with the majority of our leading customers with Integrated Material Solutions, and we're even more confident that in both future and trailing nodes, we can help our customers integrate new technologies in their chips and drive incremental growth for Applied. We also have a very strong pipeline of new products, including products that expand our positions into markets that we don't currently serve. Some of those new products are already gaining traction with major customers. So overall, I believe that the setup for Applied is better in 2019, and certainly in 2020 and beyond.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks C.J. Operator, we can have the next question.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Similar to C.J.'s question in the semiconductor market, I have a question on the display side. At recent San Jose display conference, there was a fair bit of optimism on display market rebounding next year with third-parties talking about 10% to 30% year-over-year growth. At one point, you guys were talking about tripling your footprint in the display market. Can you just talk about how you're looking at 2020 from a display perspective given longer lead times for equipment?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Let me start – thanks for the question. Let me give you some color on the display business, I'll start with 2019 and then I'll go into 2020. So for 2019, we still expect display revenue to be down about a third from 2018's record levels, with TV now being about three quarters of the business this year as customers move to Gen 10.5. Going forward, we see demand becoming more balanced between TV and mobile OLED. And as we look into 2020, based on everything we see today, TV demand looks stable and we expect mobile to grow year-over-year with a broader mobile OLED customer base. And longer term, we see great opportunities that drive growth in the display business. Some of the new technologies are more capital-intensive. There are some great inflections where we can create value for customers. So overall, again, we see 2020 certainly being better and our position also being stronger as we go forward.
Michael Sullivan: Yes. And Atif, I think you're also kind of alluding to the new products. I think the next event we do, we're really going to be focusing on semi at SEMICON West, semi new products, so I think we'll do that. So please just stay tuned on the newer display products, and thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Thanks very much for taking the question. Gary, I was hoping you could provide an update on what you're seeing in China not so much from the multinationals but more so the local manufacturers both in the foundry side as well as the memory side? Progress in terms of technology, any change in sort of buying patterns given kind of the political backdrop? Any update you can provide there would be helpful. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question, Toshiya. So let me give you a color on China. China wafer fab equipment will be down year-over-year in 2019 versus 2018, a small amount. We still see domestic flattish and multinational down in China. In domestic China, we see slightly higher spending on foundry/logic versus memory with foundry/logic focused on trailing nodes for sensor, IoT, those kinds of devices. Within China domestic spending, we're in a great position. We expect we're going to maintain a very strong share position in China. In our display business, China is going to be down in line with the overall global display forecast. And I would say relative to customer progress, certainly in the domestic foundry/logic business, we see a lot of growth in IoT, communications, automotive, power, sensor types of devices, and those are on more trailing nodes. Certainly, China has the ability to build those kinds of devices, and again, that's where we see more spending in 2019. And we see pretty strong growth there going forward. In memory, I don't want to comment on any specific customers in terms of progress, but what I would say is that memory is a very difficult market. If you look at DRAM customers, they're adding letters to their nodes because scaling is becoming more capital-intensive and more difficult. And certainly, also in 3D NAND, scaling is difficult and you can see customer presentations where capital intensity is going up as they try to scale those devices. So I think that being in the leading-edge memory is very, very, very difficult and will take many, many years.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Toshiya.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. So just going back to your reluctance to call the bottom, Dan, I kind of appreciate the conservatism given the macro uncertainty. But with sort of NAND and DRAM revenue down greater than 50% peak to current, the industry is going to have to invest in 96 layers sometime in this year. To hit your full year guide on display, you have talked to a pretty big ramp in the fiscal fourth quarter for that business. And services is still kind of structural growth. I'm kind of just curious, what's the reticence in not calling the bottom? Is it something you're seeing in your bottom book forecast? Or is it more about kind of just the macro uncertainty overhang out there?
Dan Durn: Thanks John. I think there's a couple of things at play, at least how I process it. So let me share with you a little bit of my thinking and hopefully, that will give you a bit of color on how we're viewing the world right now. I think our reluctance to call the bottom is a semiconductor comment, it's not an overall company comment. And what I mean by that, if we take a look at our semi business, there's no change to our outlook this year in terms of – no material change in terms of the WFE, the overall market, down mid- to high teens, mid-$40 billion WFE ZIP Code. I gave you the profile on how foundry/logic and memory will profile into this year. And if we go back a quarter on our earnings call, we provide a guidance around our semi systems business to be at a run rate of $2.15 billion and flat for the year. Very little has changed in our view on that business. We did a little better than that in Q2. We guided a little better than that in Q3, but what we're talking about is really a 1% move, and I think we've got to stay focused on the right run rate to think about the business is about $2.15 billion. And against that flat profile in semi, we see an OpEx level that underpins that, that's roughly flat with where we were in 2018. If I transition to the services business, we do see a step-up into the back of the year. We do have confidence in our high single-digit growth projection for the business. And I think it's important to note that Q4 is typically a seasonally good quarter for us, so we feel good about how that business profiles. In display for the full year, no change in our outlook. We said Q2, Q3 would profile very similarly. We see that playing out. We do see growth into the back part of the year. So when you bring it altogether as an overall company for Applied, while we do see flatness from a semi standpoint from this point forward, we do see growth from a services perspective, we see growth off these levels from a display perspective and the overall company, the overall company will grow from this point in 2019. And when we take a look at that mix towards the latter part of the year, we all know that our semi business has the highest gross margin, followed by display, followed by service. So with flat semi, growing service, growing display, that creates a natural gross margin headwind for us. We think we can execute well into that environment, and we're going to look to hold gross margins flat into Q4, off of the levels we produce in Q3. So we've got confidence that we can execute well into that environment. Now we don't want to guide more than one quarter out, and so a quarter from now on our earnings call, we'll let you know what we see in Q4. But we hope to execute well against that natural margin headwind and keep our margins where they're at in Q3.
Michael Sullivan: Hey, thanks John. Operator, please take the next question.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Strong foundry and logic, up 25% sequentially, up 30% year-over-year. I know you now anticipate this segment to be up versus your prior view of sort of flattish. What's driving the better outlook? Is it better trajectory on 7-nanometer foundry or 10-nanometer logic or maybe even a lagging edge IoT? And are you guys starting to see any 5-nanometer foundry, 7-nanometer logic because we know that the design activity has already started to pick up here? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Harlan. As we look at what's driving it, we said incremental improvement in foundry/logic versus where we were a quarter ago. It's offset by incremental weakness from a memory standpoint. No change to the overall WFE. As we double-click on foundry/logic, I don't think there's any one element that we can point to. We do see a diversification and a broadening of spend across mature nodes and leading-edge nodes. We do see capacity adds beginning to take shape around 5-nanometers, more at 7-nanometers. Still too early to extrapolate a trend line from that, but we're encouraged by the strength and resilience of that end market and the environment we find ourselves in, but no one specific thing to point to.
Harlan Sur: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Gary, I wanted to follow up on the WFE share comment. By my math, you sort of peaked at close to 22% in 2016. It was pretty flat in 2017. And you lost about 200 basis points last year. In that same time ASML gained about 400 basis points worth of share and it sounded in the prepared remarks like you're a little more optimistic about gaining WFE share next year and I guess, that's in a year where it seems like the industry has to come up with at least a couple of billion dollars year-over-year for EUV. So I guess I'm just trying to parse through, are you more bullish because of maybe some risk to EUV or are you bullish about the wafer capacity addition that you see on the NAND side next year? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question, I just – again, when we look at the setup for 2019, we believe that the mix is definitely more favorable for us. Certainly if you look at the foundry/logic business, the growth in IoT, communication, automotive, power sensors, those different markets, that's going to be a bigger percentage in terms of 2019. We think we're set up pretty well there. The initial buys for 5-nanometer also, we think that we're in a better position there. Again, if you look at the EUV adoption, certainly that's one way for customers to drive their roadmaps, but we talked about five different ways and EUV is one of those five. And you see customers driving improvements in power and performance, and that's all about materials innovation. So we have new steps that are being adopted both in transistor and interconnect, that's going to be positive for us in terms of the leading-edge foundry and logic. And then in memory, we also are gaining positions there and longer term we see that that's really good growth opportunity for us. If you go back over let's say a five-year period of time, we are probably 14%, 15% of the memory spend and now we're over 20% of the memory spend. And as customers are driving DRAM devices with new foundry like processes in the periphery, that's great for us because that leverages our leading-edge products, the PVD implant, thermal, CMP, all of those areas, we have very strong positions and we're gaining new positions also in memory. So again, overall, we like to set up a much better in 2020 and longer term, again, all of these roadmaps are becoming more difficult. Customers are adding all kinds of pluses to their technology nodes because, again, the scaling is getting much more difficult. And at the foundation of all that is materials innovation, Integrated Material Solutions, where we have engagements with all the major customers, it takes some time to drive those architectures and structures and materials into new devices, but we have tremendous traction there. We're certainly more optimistic in 2019 and definitely there is a lot of great things that come together for us in 2020 and beyond that will be positive for Applied.
Dan Durn: Yes. And Tim, I want to just add one more thing. When Gary explained earlier, he said there were two reasons why the share dropped year-over-year. He said one was EUV and that was coming in while our customers were in reuse mode. He said one other thing, he said there are other markets that we don't participate in that we're very strong in 2018, specifically dielectric etch and then a host of batch processes. So we do expect that EUV will continue to be good in 2019, but we don't see as much of those other areas that we nominally compete in, but in reality, do not. As a reminder, we're in conductor etch, not dielectric, right. We are in single wafer processes, not batch processes. So it’s that part of that two-part equation that explains what you're describing.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks Mike.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Gary, you mentioned TV flattish and mobile growing next year on the display side. That sounds kind of like a mid-single digit growth opportunity. I just wanted to make sure that's the right way to think about it from a 2020 perspective. And longer term, do you think your display business kind of grows more in line with the adoption of OLED in phones. Just what is the right way to conceptually think about growth in display?
Gary Dickerson: Well, I would say for next year we certainly believe that the market is going to be stronger than it is this year. We're not giving any estimates in terms of the magnitude of the growth into next year. But longer term, we see this is a great opportunity. Before this year for several years in a row, we were growing at 25% compound annual growth rate. The – just like in semi, those display technologies are very difficult. If you look at mobile OLED, I mentioned that the customer base will be broadening out. And that will be great for Applied, it will also be great for adoption as there are more customers that can supply those types of devices. And we look at the capital intensity is increasing. As I said, in flex OLED, it goes up by about a factor of two. And we're certainly working on very high value problems for our customers in the display market that further expand our business. So longer term, we think that this is a very good growth driver for the Company.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Pierre Ferragu with Newstreet Research. Your line is now open.
Pierre Ferragu: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, Dan, I understand you don't want to call the bottom, but I see like your semiconductor what you anticipate for next quarter to be kind of flattish sequentially. And my question is really, if you get the run rate of this quarter like the – the money that your clients spent with you in DRAMs, so that's about $400 million, $500 million in NAND, that kind of run rate, what's happening in the market, what's happening in the installed base. Does that mean zero capacity additions, does that mean capacity reduction? So where are we in terms of capacity being added in the market at this run rate?
Dan Durn: Thanks, Pierre. As we take a look at the overall market and the willingness to call the bottom, that's as much a function of what we're seeing in the end market as it is just a recognition of the elevated risk environment we find ourselves in. And we just think it's prudent right now to set expectations in a way that reflect that environment. And I just think you see that coming through in the way in which we're talking about the business and again it's only intended to be prudent in this environment. As we take a look at both memory types and we look at capacity additions, as we think about the investments going in today, the investments are more of a technology transition nature. Technology transitions are fundamentally, as you know, about cost competitiveness of our customers going forward. And so as those markets recover, they're going to need to keep pace from a technology roadmap standpoint to be cost competitive as those markets recover. If we look at the aggregate capacity in each of those markets, we look at them as flat to down slightly in both of those markets. This is not a year for capacity adds. What you see are some conversions going on and when you convert, you tend to lose some capacity. So investors are acting in a – I mean, I'm sorry, the customers are acting in a very profit-minded disciplined way to keep the supply demand in balance in a difficult year. I think what that sets us up well for as we exit the year, we do think that our customers under-ship end market demand as they work down inventories in the channel, both their inventories as well as their customers' inventory and that's a good setup going into 2020. But in this year, we don't expect capacity additions in either of those two markets.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Pierre.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I had one for Dan. Dan, I just had a question on the buybacks, it looks like your services business is pretty resilient and growing, so that alone can probably fund the dividend easily. And I understand the reluctance to call the bottom. But it looks like you are in a bottoming out phase. So, why wouldn't you be more aggressive with the buyback or is it because you're seeing – like keeping it as dry powder for M&A for some attractive assets out there or is there a change in the methodology of how you think about buybacks?
Dan Durn: Thanks, Krish. I think the best way to think about this is not read too much in any one quarter in terms of what we do from a buyback. I think you need to take a look at a longer term trend line of what our company has done. We've always talked about our three priorities for capital allocation and it's a consistent approach to capital allocation. That hasn't changed over time. First element is we're going to fully fund growth of this company that has an organic and inorganic component to it. The second priority will be to maintain a strong flexible balance sheet. And the third priority is to take the vast majority of the excess cash and give it back to shareholders. If you look at a two-decade trend for the Company, we're very close to a 100% of excess cash has gone back to shareholders. We've been big purchasers of our shares, given what we see happening and unfolding in our end markets as a result of the data economy diversifying end market demand in our business, we think that takes the semiconductor industry structurally larger. By implication, that's going to take our industry structurally larger, even off the levels we saw in 2018 and Applied will benefit in a very material way. In the last four quarters alone we've repurchased about 8% of the company, last three years around 17%, in the last five years, just about 28% of the company. So I think we've been significant purchasers of our shares in light of what we see unfolding. And we think a steady approach to this quarter in, quarter out is the right approach to take – to drive long-term shareholder value. So I wouldn't read too much into any one quarter and just look at our track record over an extended period of time, which I think is quite strong.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Dan.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Krish.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joseph Moore: Great, thank you. I had a question – your comments upfront, you talked about NAND kind of stabilizing. And I guess there are segments of NAND where that's true, but generally your customers have sort of talked about margins continuing to come down in the back half. I just want to make sure, I mean, when you talk about NAND stabilization that's not weighing heavily into your forecast, it seems like there's fairly dormant NAND spending in the second half, but just is – when you see that stabilization, is that kind of upside to the numbers that we're talking about here or just how should we think about that?
Dan Durn: Thanks, Joe, let me share a little bit of our thinking and hopefully that will help give you insight into where we see the NAND correction cycle. If we're on this call a year ago, that was the first time we started to talk about a pullback from an investment standpoint of our customers and it was still at a time when margins hadn't reached their peak. And so I think it's the first time in the industry's history where you saw that disciplined behavior of our customers begin to pull back at a time when margins were still moving forward. And I think it created some confusion. And the reason I bring that data point up is, I think the NAND industry is further along the correction cycle than the DRAM industry. And in the prepared comments, we talked about inventory being off of their peaks, but still at an elevated level. So when we talk about early signs of stabilization, I would say, stabilization not in hindsight, or in the past tense, so I think it's in the process of stabilizing, hasn't fully stabilized yet, but we feel good that we're seeing those early signs and we see NAND is further along in that correction cycle than DRAM. So we've got more work to do as an industry, but again as we roll the business forward off these levels, we think we profile roughly flat for the rest of the year from a semi system standpoint.
Joseph Moore: Makes sense. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Gary, maybe just as a follow-up to some of the commentary you said about foundry/logic and Applied's positioning. Are some of the gains on the market share driven by your growth segments like etch and deposition or are they across the board with some of your leadership process segments as well?
Gary Dickerson: Patrick, let me give you – thanks for the question. Let me give you some color maybe overall in terms of how I see Applied. And within that, I'll talk about the different products. So when I look forward, I see a number of factors that can drive very strong performance for Applied. As we've said before, in the semi market, we're at the biggest – beginning of the biggest wave we've ever seen is AI, big data wave. In the next two years we could see this wave building momentum and creating a very strong semiconductor market. At the same time, as I talked about earlier, capital intensity is increasing in memory and foundry/logic. And in foundry/logic, you see the end of classic Moore's Law. And as I talked about earlier, you see customers having 7, 7P, 7 plus, 6 popped up on the roadmap, some customers talking about many pluses. Again, I think that's an indication that driving improvements in power, performance, area and cost is getting harder and harder. So we certainly see that in both the memory business and in the foundry/logic business and we've talked about this new path forward with five drivers. We've had some of our peers talk about similar drivers and some customers talking about those drivers relative to how you're going to improve power, performance, area and cost and we're really, really in the beginning of this, but you can see evidence of this in terms of the customer behavior, how they're driving the devices. So that's a great setup for us. If we look at our unit processes, we look at the Integrated Material Solutions that we have like the 1,000x improvement in leakage current, it's really a great setup for us. Let me go a little bit broader and talk about our display business. We've said our display market will pick up over the next two years. Capital intensity there is also increasing. Our service business is becoming an increasing part of the company. We have the largest installed base for service. Our subscription type revenue is also growing very fast. And if the semiconductor market strengthens over the next two years, this business can go back to double-digit growth for Applied. So you put the new products that we have that are targeted for the biggest problems our customers have in memory, scaling, the memory devices, addressing the leading-edge foundry and logic, performance, power, area, cost, new segments like IoT, communication, automotive, power, sensors. All of those things together, if you look out two years from now, you've got stronger markets, stronger position, service still growing, a combination of factors that could be really great for overall performance for Applied.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. All the good ones have been asked, but I have a couple of follow-ups. One for Gary. I just want to better understand how a greenfield fab would help with some of these initiatives that you have taken over the past two years versus existing fabs that are basically been converted like there are fabs, NAND-fabs that are being converted from a 64 layer 3D NAND to 96 and there are greenfield fabs. The same for DRAM. So as these greenfield fabs, at sometime in the future are actually going to turn on again, would that create a bigger opportunity for you given all R&Ds of the past or is that going to be the same as a fab being converted, and I have a follow-up.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, I think the bigger – so certainly the greenfield fabs create a bigger opportunity for us. But I think that really the biggest factor for us is what technologies are enabling those future devices when they ramp those greenfield factories. So if you look at the DRAM, as I mentioned, DRAM you have lot – the periphery moving to more logic like type structures, so similar to what we saw in 28-nanometer foundry, you see strong demand for PVD implant, thermal processing, CMP. In DRAM, you see capacitor formation, new structures, we have positive patterning inflections for Applied in memory, I/O layer formation, so many things within DRAM. In 3D NAND, scaling is about multiple things, more layers, more tiers, focusing on layer thickness, lateral scaling. We're winning new etch applications in NAND. And one of the things that is most important in scaling NAND is new materials especially high selectivity hard mask where we have very strong capability. We have a new hard mask material that increases etch selectivity by 50% and we already see qualifications in future technology nodes. So a lot of those types of technologies, Mehdi, are ones that are enabling our memory customers. We have similar types of technologies for foundry and logic. And then the other thing, again I want to talk about that I mentioned before, are the Integrated Material Solutions, combining multiple technologies in the same platforms under vacuum. And we see engagements with many of our large customers. It takes some time for those new structures to be integrated into a node. But if you think about customers announcing improvements in power and performance, that's a key part of their competitiveness. We have technologies that enable improvements in power, performance. We have traction there with many large customers. And again, that will also fuel our growth over the future years.
Dan Durn: And just to build on a little bit of what Gary was talking about to add some dimension, Mehdi, to the greenfield opportunity over time. We're currently tracking 31 300-millimeter factories around the globe. There's only a couple of them that are in the very early stages of beginning to take equipment and if we look at the aggregate WFE that those facilities represent, it's about almost $180 billion of WFE over time. So our customers are preparing for something that we think takes our industry structurally larger and is going to benefit Applied Materials as these macro trends we're talking about play out over time. So we're really encouraged by both the conversions and technology buys we see today, as well as future greenfield build-outs over time.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up for you, Dan. And I apologize if this topic has already come up, what should we think of OpEx looking into the second half?
Dan Durn: So I think we want to guide one quarter at a time. We'll talk about Q4 three months from now. What I did say in the Q&A, just to help give you some perspective on it, Mehdi, is we expect to keep OpEx flat this year with where we ended up 2018. And I think between the two quarters we've printed the one quarter we've guided. I think that gives you a sense of where the rest of the year is likely to unfold.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thanks so much.
Dan Durn: You're welcome. Mehdi.
Michael Sullivan: Operator, I think we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on Dan's comments in the prepared script about the opportunity for field upgrades, retrofits and parts. How much of that comes into the AGS business. How much of that drives the semiconductor systems and then I've got a quick follow-up.
Dan Durn: Yes, let me see – let me just pull up some data so I'm giving you the right perspective. So if we look, the vast majority of that number rolls into AGS, I'd say roughly maybe 20% of the number rolls through our semiconductor systems business, which includes non-system upgrades as well as 300-millimeter refurbs. So it's roughly 80/20, give or take.
Quinn Bolton: Great, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on the – with the recent escalation in the tariff uncertainties. Again, have you done any – taken a look at what might happen to cost of goods if we get tariffs on the next $325 billion of China imports, would that have a meaningful impact on cost? Or do you think you're pretty well insulated from that event, should it happen? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks for the follow-up. We feel pretty good about where we sit. If we look at everything that's been enacted to-date and what's been discussed most recently, we think we've got plans in place to offset the impacts of that. The net impact of any of those tariffs becomes an immaterial impact to the company. It's clearly something we're going to watch very closely. We'll continue to optimize our footprint, our operations and how we have geared our supply chain and logistics organization to make sure we continue to minimize the impact. But right now, given where we sit and what we know today, we think the net impact is going to be immaterial to the overall results of the company.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Quinn. Dan, let me just kick it over to you. Anything else you want to say before we close the call?
Dan Durn: Yes, sure. Thanks Mike. Just a couple of quick points to close out the call. First, we talked about it on the call. While I'm still not ready to call the bottom of the semiconductor cycle, I do believe we're seeing the early signs of stability and that's something that I find encouraging. Second, I like our setup for 2020. I believe off of these levels, WFE can grow into next year. I also think display can be higher and we've talked about the great job the team is doing executing against recurring revenue in our services business. So I especially like the setup around Applied as we look into 2020. Third, I believe the new bets we're making from a technology standpoint, Gary spent a lot of time talking about it on the call, I think they're going to pay off in a big way as the next wave of computing takes off, I hope you join us at the AI Design Forum over the summer. We'll share with you a lot more of what we're doing during that conference. Lastly, over the next couple of weeks Gary and I are going to be seeing many of you. We're both going to travel to the Bernstein Conference at the end of the month. And then I will be in New York for the Cowen Conference and also Europe for BNP. With that Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.
Michael Sullivan: All right. Thanks, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available on our website by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-02-14 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and answer-session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied’s current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-K and 8-K filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of February 14, 2019, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. In our first fiscal quarter of 2019, Applied Materials delivered solid results in a challenging business environment. Over the past two months, we have become increasingly cautious about near-term macroeconomic risks and have seen further pullback in customers’ investments. At the same time, we remain highly optimistic about the long-term. Powerful new growth drivers for the semiconductor and display industries are emerging, and we see tremendous opportunities for the Company ahead. While we’re taking appropriate actions to navigate current market dynamics, we are not losing focus on the bigger picture. We’re making strategic investments in new technology, products and capabilities that will position Applied to play a bigger and broader role in the future. In today's call, I'll start by providing more details about our outlook for the year ahead; then, I'll talk about the future growth drivers that are reshaping our industry; and I will finish by describing Applied’s strategy and highlight some recent accomplishments and milestones. Let me begin with the near-term environment and our current perspective on 2019. In the past quarter, there's been more negative than positive news with the whole industry facing challenges, which include macro conditions in emerging markets that have weakened; smartphone demand falling short of expectations, particularly for high-end models which have more semiconductor content; and DRAM prices, which have declined as inventory levels build. On the positive side, we've also observed that NAND inventories are coming down from very high levels seen in the fall, although they remain above normal levels. Fundamental dynamics in the memory market are healthy with very-disciplined investment in new capacity and a strong commitment to advance the technology roadmap. And, looking more broadly at semiconductor capital investment, it’s important to note that we are in a period of market transition and diversification. For the past several years, smartphones drove the majority of wafer fab equipment spending. This year, more than half of customers’ investments will be driven by other categories as new growth drivers, including cloud data centers, IoT devices, 5G and automotive applications gain momentum. When we take all these factors into account, we see the following implications for Applied’s served markets. Based on recent public comments by our customers, NAND bit demand is expected to grow in the mid-30% range this year and DRAM bit demand in the mid to high teens. As result, we believe that investment by memory customers will be down substantially in 2019. However, we also expect channel inventory levels to normalize as the year progresses, creating a more favorable setup for 2020. In foundry logic, we see investment being flat to slightly up year-on-year, but we expect a higher portion of the spending to be directed towards long lead time equipment, specifically EUV lithography. While this represents a market share headwind for Applied in both 2018 and 2019, it’s also a positive indicator of customers’ future investment in leading-edge process tools. Overall, we believe that wafer fab equipment spending in 2019 will be down mid to high teens on a percentage basis versus last year. In display, weakness in emerging markets is also impacting the timing of customers’ investment plans. We see some TV factory projects pushing out of year and into 2020. As a result, we now believe our display equipment revenue in 2019 will decline by about a third from 2018's record levels. We also expect revenue in the second fiscal quarter to be significantly lower than our average run rate for the year. Over the longer term, we believe the display market remains attractive as the industry is going through several large technology transitions as larger substrates are introduced in TV manufacturing, rigid OLED adoption increases in smartphones and expands to other applications and initial flexible OLED products get closer to release. These inflections create important growth opportunities for Applied over the next several years. While we’re paying close attention to current headwinds and driving efficiencies across the Company, we remain focused on our long-term opportunities. I strongly believe that in the future, technology will play a larger part in many areas of our lives. Entire industries will be transformed by artificial intelligence, big data and Industry 4.0. And at the foundation of those transformations are semiconductors. We're moving beyond a world of general purpose computing to specialized solutions that address new types of applications and workloads in the cloud and at the edge. And while the need for semiconductor innovation has never been greater, classic Moore's law scaling is challenged. Simply shrinking transistors no longer delivers simultaneous improvements in the power, performance and cost of chips. As I’ve said before, to unlock the full potential of AI and big data, we need a new playbook for semi conductor design and manufacturing, which will include new architectures, new 3D techniques, novel materials, new ways to shrink transistors and advanced packaging techniques, all five of these areas required major advances in materials engineering and create tremendous opportunities for Applied Materials. To enable this playbook and accelerate innovation for our customers, we are making investments in new capabilities, creating entirely new types of products and extending our engagements across the ecosystem. For example, we recently announced that we are expanding our longstanding technology partnership with IBM as a member of their new AI hardware center. We’re also making good progress with our new materials engineering technology accelerator, which is on track to open later this year. The META Center will support deeper collaborations with system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community. In addition to broadening our participation in the AI big data inflection, we’re also building a more resilient company with diversified revenue streams. The portion of our revenue generated from sources other than new 300 millimeters semiconductor equipment sales is increasing. Combined, we expect our services, spares, upgrades, consulting, software and display and flexible technology businesses to represent about 45% of total sales this year. In Applied Global Services, our progress is fueled by a growing installed base and new advanced service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize operating costs. We grew AGS revenue more than 20% in fiscal 2018, and we anticipate high single digit growth this year, even with wafer fab equipment spending expected to be down significantly. One reason for this is that more than half our service and spares business now comes from subscription type revenues in the form of long-term service agreements. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Given the elevated macro risks and a challenging environment in both the memory and display markets, our near-term outlook is one of caution. Despite these headwinds in 2019, we remain highly optimistic about the future. While we are taking steps to ensure our spending is aligned with short-term market conditions, we’re focusing our investments on long-term opportunities. We’re driving innovative new product development and building new capabilities that position Applied to play a bigger and broader role in the industry over the coming years. Now, Dan will provide his perspective on our performance and outlook.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. Today, I will outline our financial strategy in the current environment, then summarize our Q1 financial results, provide our Q2 business outlook and give you an update on our new META Center in New York. As Gary outlined, the end markets that our customers serve, weakened during the quarter. As a result, our semi equipment customers are taking proactive steps to carefully manage capacity additions and reduce inventories. This sets the industry up well for 2020 and beyond. We continue to expect the recovery to be shallow and gradual, and we’re still not ready to call the bottom of the current cycle. At the same time, it's important to put this year’s spending into context. Our WFE forecast for 2019 is still billions of dollars higher than the peaks of all the prior cycles. Today, our backlog remains healthy, our profitability is solid, we’re generating strong free cash flow, and we’re returning cash to shareholders. Most importantly, we see significant opportunities ahead. And we have the resources to make disciplined investments to secure technology leadership and growth. Our strategy is to navigate the current environment by carefully managing our overall expenses, fully funding our new product pipeline and maximizing our recurring revenue. Here are some specific examples. First, expense control. Our Q1 non GAAP OpEx was $750 million, including savings from our holiday shutdown and only one month of our annual merit increase. In Q2, absent these same benefits, we’re guiding our overall OpEx to be approximately flat sequentially. Next, R&D funding. Even in the current environment, we’re investing more in R&D to strengthen and grow our new technology and product pipeline. Gary described how the industry needs new architectures and materials to enable better chips for AI. Later this year, we plan to introduce materials engineering solutions designed to accelerate the adoption of the next generation of memory chips, which will be highly enabling the cloud computing and the Internet of things. Third, recurring revenue. Gary described our services revenue should be higher in 2019, even as WFE declines. We expect the transactional portion of our AGS revenue to grow more slowly this year as our customers work down excess inventories, but the subscription part of AGS should be higher year-over-year. In fact, in 2018, we grew the number of tools under comprehensive service agreements at 3 times the rate of new system shipments. So, we’re doing a good job of delivering ongoing value of our customers across a larger portion of our installed base, which is the largest in the industry. Next, I'll summarize our quarterly results. As a reminder, Applied adopted the ASC 606 standard for revenue recognition this quarter, using the full retrospective approach. Bear in mind, the differences between revenue recognized under ASC 606 and the old standard will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but over time, they will offset each other and the cumulative difference will be minimal. As we expected, the adoption of ASC 606 had a minimal cumulative impact on the Company, increasing our retained earnings by about $6 million. Now, to the results. In Q1, we delivered revenue that was slightly above the midpoint of guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses were at the midpoint of guidance. We generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.81, which was $0.02 above the midpoint, including the impact of a slightly higher tax rate. Turning to the segments. Semiconductor Systems revenue was $2.27 billion and about 1 percentage point above the midpoint of our outlook. SSG’s non-GAAP operating margin was 28.3%. Global Services revenue was $962 million and 2 points above the midpoint of our guidance. AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 29.6%. Display revenue was $507 million and 1 point above the midpoint of our guidance. The Group’s non-GAAP operating margin was 23.3%. Turning to the balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $834 million or 22% of sales. We returned $942 million to shareholders including $750 million in buybacks. We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion in cash and investments, and $3.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Next, I’ll provide our Q2 guidance. We expect Company revenue to be approximately $3.48 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Within the outlook, we expect silicon systems revenue to be in the range of $2.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Services revenue should be $970 million, plus or minus $25 million. Our Display revenue should be in the range of $340 million, plus or minus $25 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margins of around 43.5% and non-GAAP OpEx of around $750 million, plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP earnings should be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70 per share. And our current non-GAAP tax rate expectation is approximately 14%. This is about 2 percentage points higher than our initial expectation for 2019. We've raised our rate expectation primarily to reflect the potential impact of new regulations proposed by the Treasury Department along with our latest forecast for geographic revenue mix. Now, I will close with an update on the R&D capabilities we’re creating at our META Center in upstate New York. Over the past quarter, we received approvals needed to begin receiving $250 million in public funding, which is being used to purchase and install Applied Materials systems and other equipment. We've now shipped our first systems to the META Center, which will be one of the most advanced R&D centers in the world. We’re already engaged with multiple customers to accelerate breakthroughs in semiconductor technology along with new applications of our materials engineering capabilities, and we’re on track to be running wafers in the second half of the year. Now, Mike, let’s begin the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. Now, to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please pull the operator, and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: I guess, two-part question. In terms of your overall guide by segment, it looks like you’re suggesting roughly $3.55 billion a quarter in revenues. And I guess, is that math kind of in the ballpark of what you’re thinking? And then, more importantly, how are you thinking about gross margin trajectory as we go through the year on the changing mix?
Dan Durn: Thanks, C.J. Can I get you to repeat your first question? I didn’t quite understand where you're going. The second part of the question is, as we look sequentially into Q2, you see the gross margin guide. Off of those levels into the back half of our fiscal year, we would expect to see incremental improvement into Q3 and then step up again into Q4. But, I apologize. I didn’t catch the first part of your question.
C.J. Muse: It was just adding up the different segment guide, and is it fair to say that roughly $3.55 billion is kind of what you’re seeing on average on a quarterly basis for revenues through the calendar year?
Dan Durn: Yes. So, I don't think on this call, we’ll be guiding for the full year. But, what we do see in the Q2 is $3.48 billion for the overall Company revenue, plus or minus $150 million.
Operator: Our next question is from Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: A two-part question for me as well. First, Gary, could you just talk about what should we expect display mix between LCD and OLED this year? And then, is there any change to your view on the capital intensity of OLED TVs into next year as some of the LCD makers are converting the LCD line to quantum dot and other flavors of OLED? And then, I have a follow-up for Dan.
Gary Dickerson: Okay. Thanks for the question. Let me give you some overall color on the display business. And hopefully, I'll cover the two questions that you have. In the six years through 2018, we were able to grow the display business at a compound annual growth rate of around 25% to $2.5 billion last year. In 2019, we signaled incremental weakness on the last call. And the market has continued to weaken since that call. We now believe that the market is down around a third from 2018’s record levels with second quarter -- our second quarter to be significantly lower than our projected average run rate for 2019 and 2020. Relative to the mix on -- what we have is the biggest incremental change since the last call as weakness in TV, delays in TV investments. It’s still compelling for customers to go to Gen 10.5 panels because you can produce eight 65-inch TVs versus three on Gen 8.5. So, it’s strategically important for them to go and make that transition. But, the timing of the investments are being pushed out. And then, going into 2020, we see small improvement in 2020. And we defiantly like the longer-term technology trends and opportunities to grow the business. So, hopefully that gives you some indication around mix. The biggest difference from our last call is in TV market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Gary, you talked about the EUV headwind and the impact it had on your market share in 2018, and your expectations for 2019. Should we be concerned that it could remain a headwind into 2020 and beyond or is there sort of initial ramp-up of EUV that’s causing some of these issues for you? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. I think if you look at overall market share, third-party data is going to come out in a little over a month. We will all see the numbers, including our share. One thing that we’ll see is that in the six years going into 2017, we were the only major supplier to be up or flat for six consecutive years. And certainly, what we said in ‘18 is that our share will be down, demand softened in the back half of the year; we saw push out to NAND, reuse in foundry. And overall spending mix shifted towards litho and areas we don't compete. What you will see in about a month is gains in areas like implant, epi, etch, gaining momentum in packaging. And also in our process control business, I’m happy about the progress there. We had a record year. Very strong growth in our e-beam technologies. We may end up being number one in e-beam for the first time ever, and very well positioned with the additional adoptions of new products in ‘19. In ‘18 and ‘19, logic customers are buying EUV systems. And those systems have very long lead times. They are buying the EUV tools years before they go into high-volume manufacturing. We look at that as a positive indicator in the adoption of future nodes. But certainly, right now, in ‘18 and ‘19, it's definitely a headwind. And as we go forward as NAND spending resumes, that's more material spending versus litho spending. That's certainly good for us. The trailing nodes are also not litho dependent. So, that's also going to be good going forward. And then, another factor in ‘19 that’s more favorable setup for us, we have balanced share in foundry logic and memory. So, in a year where DRAM and NAND are much weaker, the relative set-up for us is better in 2019. And then, what we’ve talked about is over the longer term, we see a very different picture emerging. It’s clear, the industry needs a new playbook that goes beyond 2D scaling. And I deeply believe Applied is in the best position to enable the playbook. I meet all the time with customers, the leaders of R&D for our top customers on a monthly basis. And this is a big focus for all of those customers. We’ve talked about five drivers of power, performance and area and cost as to 2D scaling slows, and all of those are dependent on breakthroughs in materials engineering. So, I would say longer term, that creates a great opportunity for us. Dan talked about in his prepared remarks new memory technology for AI that's coming later this year; I’ve talked about a 1,000x improvement in leakage current that improves power efficiency. Those are just early examples of the new playbook, extensive playbook that we've developed. And then, we've also talked about speeding up the new playbook by opening the META Center and figuring out how to integrate all this together, so customers can move it into their fabs. I definitely believe the right vision for the industry is material to systems 10 times faster, driving this new playbook. There's never been a time where it's more important. So, that’s the playbook on how we’re going to move the needle for the industry and for Applied.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Garry, as always, I appreciate all the detail you gave in your prepared comments. One of the things you mentioned is just the expectation that memory will be down significantly this year in calendar year ‘19, which really shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody. I was wondering if you could just help us understand how your views differ between NAND and DRAM CapEx for this year, and whether or not you see either recovering in the back half of the calendar year? And I guess importantly, could you talk a little bit about what happens to your SAM in NAND as the industry transitions from 64 to 96 layers?
Gary Dickerson: So, thanks for the question. Let me take first the market opportunity for us. There is no question as customers increase the number of layers, it's all about materials intensity. And so, that creates a tremendous opportunity for us. We grew market share in memory a significant amount over the last five years. A lot of the improvements around new materials, new technologies that drive that scaling are really great opportunities for Applied. We are increasing our etch share also in memory. So, that's also a very good setup for us. So, certainly, as the scaling goes forward, we expect that we’re going to continue to grow our share, as we've done over the last several years. And maybe Dan, you can answer the question about DRAM versus NAND.
Dan Durn: Sure. Thanks, Gary. And John, to get to how 2019 is profiling in the memory space, let me start with what we saw in 2018 and use that as a jumping off point to make some comparative statements about how we see the market profiling in 2019. We’ll probably not going to be point specific on how 2018 ended up because Gartner’s going to come out in a month or two with those estimates. But, we definitely saw 2018 up over ‘17, definitely has a 5 handle on it. And as you indicated, it was a strong memory growth year. We think as 2018 settled, 60% of the spend in the market was memory related, 40% -- about 40% was foundry logic related. Within memory, we saw the NAND DRAM spend very balanced. As we look forward into 2019 and Gary’s prepared comments, he said, year-over-year, WFE in ‘19 will be down. Memory will be down by a good amount. We expect foundry logic to be flat to up a little bit. So, as 2019 shakes out, we expect foundry logic to be greater than memory. Overall, the market will be down mid to high teens. And as we look at the market between NAND and DRAM, we see it profiling very similar to ‘18 and being balanced. In terms of the second half and come back in the market. I think, we want to set expectations for a slow, gradual recovery off of these levels. While we're having conversations with customers and we see positive lead indicators, we think it's prudent in this environment to set those expectations for a slow, gradual recovery. As we look into the back half of the year, inventory levels come down faster than we expect, utilizations come up and price stability, those would all create the environmentals for a more robust second half. And if that scenario materializes, then we would benefit significantly from that environment. And then, I wanted to come back to C.J.'s original question, because now I think I understand a bit of what he was asking for. And I apologize, C.J. Let me help shape the revenues this year to I think get at the question you were asking. Off of the levels we guided in Q2, we see our Semi Systems Group flattish on a quarterly basis into the back part of the year. The run rate of our Display business in Q2 will be below the annual average. So, we would see -- expect to see that growing into the back part of the year. And then, AGS will have its normal seasonal profile and be higher into Q3 and Q4. So, hopefully, that helps giving you a bit of a profile and color. And then, the gross margin part of your question again, we expected that to incrementally step up in Q3 and again into Q4.
Operator: Our next question is from Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Can you just help us understand how you’re thinking about the OpEx trajectory beyond Q2, if you do start to see gradual recovery as you describe it? And then, on the other hand, if revenues were to take another step down, let’s say beyond Q2, how much could the team flex their OpEx?
Dan Durn: So, OpEx is definitely a controllable spend line. The philosophy we have at the Company is, is we’re going to be an inflection-focused growth company. We’re going to grow organically and invest in products and capabilities that will help drive that growth going forward. We do it in the context of the environment we operate in. We will be disciplined operators and instill spend discipline throughout the Company. As you take a look at the guide into Q2, what I would expect, if you take a step back and think about where we were a quarter or two ago, we had said we spend about $3 billion in OpEx in 2018, we would expect that to grow by about $200 million into ‘19. We've adjusted those plans in light of the current environment we’re in and will probably bring that down by about $175 million over the course of 2019 off of the original expectations. So, up 1 percent, maybe 1.5% off of the levels we were in 2018. And we think this strikes the right balance, giving everything we know between near-term discipline that reflects the environment we operate in and strong pursuit of new technologies, new platforms, new winning products that will preserve shareholder value creation into the inflections that we see materializing in the years ahead.
Operator: Our next question is from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Your line is now open.
Pierre Ferragu: I just wanted come back to the point you make Gary about EUV being like a share gainer against you this year but the leading indicator for you going forward. So, how much visibility did you have at this point in time on when you EUV gets introduced in mass manufacturing, how the share I would say of AMAT of spending wafer is evolving? So, that’s one question. And then, the second question is, how much of the benefit you see on the back of EUV is just more of what you do already, and how much is actually new technology you’re going to introduce as well, things like cobalt interconnect and others?
Gary Dickerson: So, EUV, as I’ve talked about, you’re seeing early adoption in 2018 and 2019. And in 2019, you’re going to see the first ships being built. So, you have pilot production in -- when you’re adopting the new technology like this, it happens years before you go into high-volume manufacturing. So, you see this initial adoption surge in advance of a high-volume manufacturing. And so, again, we do see that as a good leading indicator relative to N5 for instance, when that happens. Now, one thing also to remember is that EUV will remove legacy etch and dep steps. I mean, that’s why customers are adopting EUV because it replaces a number of different etch steps, but those aren’t our steps. So, at every node, the most important thing for the customers is they have to drive power, performance and area and cost. And definitely with power and performance 2D scaling helps, but even more important is innovation in material. So, if you look at a node like N5 for instance, there are many materials inflections that are being adopted as customers drive improvements in power and performance. We have a number of different new steps there advanced metal gate material, epi steps, we have hot and cold implant going from 500 degree C to minus 140, new surface treatments. We’re increasing our share in etch steps and have good momentum in new process control solutions. So, that is what will come four us. But what you see right now is this early adoption of EUV as customers prepare for those higher volume ramps. What I will also say, and I’ve talked about this many times is I do believe that the industry needs a new playbook. We have stronger and deeper engagements than we've ever had with customers. So, that really positions us well. Relative to N5, we’re well-positioned. We have deep engagements with customers are to drive power and performance on N5 and also for future nodes. And just the last thing I would add, when we talk about EUV adoption, the majority of the EUV is really in leading-edge technology and logic foundry. You have half the market that’s memory that’s driven by materials; you’ve got about 25% of the market that’s specialty nodes, power devices, image sensors, which also are great opportunity for us. So, we see about 75% of market really great opportunities. And the leading edge foundry and logic is really about power and performance in addition to 2D scaling. And we’re in the best position to drive that with our customers going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar from Cowen. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Steve [ph] calling on behalf of Krish. First one, if I could, Gary, on your Semi Systems business as it relates to China, fully appreciate the ongoing U.S. China trade tension, and also given that there is that -- the one export control on one of your DRAM customers in China. I was wondering if you have seen any spillover effects from trade tensions and control as some of your other customers, whether it’s in terms of pushout in any ramp schedules or perhaps even -- any increased focus or sourcing tools from local Chinese vendors -- by your Chinese customers as well?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, relative to China, from what we see today, it feels like mostly business as usual with our customers in the region. We’re very well-positioned in China with domestic and multinational customers. We've been in China for 35 years, very deep relationships across semi and display. Just a little bit of color on China. We expect China wafer fab equipment investment to be down year-over-year in ‘19 versus ‘18. And we see both domestic and multinational down in China. In China domestic, we see higher spending on foundry logic versus memory with foundry logic focused on trailing nodes, for sensors, IoT, those types of devices. Within China domestic spending, we’re in a great position and we expect that we’re going to gain share. And then, also our Display business in China will be down, in line with our overall global Display forecast. So, overall, we have a super strong position in China, Semi Service, Display, great teams, strong relationship and feel good about how we’re positioned going forward.
Unidentified Analyst: If I could ask quick follow-up on 200 millimeter equipment demand. I think number of foundries globally have talked about 8-inch wafer fab initiatives focused specifically on IoT, automotive opportunities in the future. Is that something that will help equipment demand later this year? And should we expect to see those benefits on the systems side or on the AGS side? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks for the question, Steve. The trailing node geometries in general have been profiling very strong for the last couple of years, and 200 millimeter equipment demand is also the same. We continue to expect a healthy outlook for those mature nodes going forward. And the 200 millimeter equipment demand remains strong. Like you said, IoT sensors are proliferating and driving significant demand at those mature nodes. I would also say that there are new AI chip architectures that are being designed at the 28 nanometer node, and they are going to deliver high performance. But to get the same transistor count out into the market as the 7 nanometer node, you need 8 times of the wafer at 28 nanometer. So, the fact that we’re getting new designs of highly capable silicon at nodes like 28 nanometers, I think bodes well for the trialing node market. 200 millimeter is experiencing the same type of dynamic and continues to be strong. From a financial reporting standpoint, we report our 200 millimeter equipment segment as part of our services, AGS reporting segment.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: I had two questions. Dan, I guess, the first one is, I’m looking at the gross margins guidance, 43.5; it’s about the same as you were doing on like $1 billion lower revenue, sort of in mid-2016. So, my first question is, I’m just kind of wondering why gross margin gains are not really dropping through over that period. Is that because a lot of the incremental revenue is coming on the services side? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Tim. As we talked about historically, gross margin is going to be a function of a number of factors. There is an aggregate revenue component; there is mix between our segments and then product mix within segments as well as overall activity levels in the factory, and they will vary from quarter to quarter. As we take a look at our guide into Q2, when we compare it to peak quarter, about a year ago, we’re profiling favorably relative to our peers in the industry. And so, the Company we think is doing a good job in a difficult environment, given the parameters we talked about that influence gross margin and we’re profiling I think favorably relative to peers in the industry, given that peak comparison. And you had a follow-up question, Tim.
Timothy Arcuri: I did. And yes, I’m just trying to understand the change in the model. I think, you said maybe six or some months ago before WFE fell off, I think the feeling was that you would do roughly 3.25 annualized at 40 billion WFE. We’re sort of even a little bit above that right, we’re probably a 41 or 42. But even if you say we’re at 40, you’re sort of -- based on the guidance, you’re at roughly 2.65 a year annualized. So, that's roughly 20% below where you thought, so pretty big number. I’m just wondering, sort of what’s changed. Thanks.
Dan Durn: So, here is what I would share with you and what we see. In the November quarter, we noted that 2019 was going to shape up a lot like 2017, and that would give us an earnings per share a bit above $3.25. And since then, we’ve seen pre-announcements by end customers, one company in the smartphones space, another one in the GPU, and cryptocurrency continues to be weak. So, we've taken customer spending down in semi and display. And if you layer in what Gary said, down mid to high teens on a year-over-year basis, clearly, WFE spend is now below the levels we saw in 2017. So, my expectation is, is that earnings not surprisingly will be lower than they were in 2017. But, I do like the way the customers are taking proactive steps to get supply in balance with demand, work down inventories in both memory and the logic foundry space. So, I see the setup into 2020 as being quite good.
Operator: Our next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: A classification and a question. On the clarification, Dan, I was hoping you could give us some more color around the subscription versus transactional mix in AGS. So, let us predict how sensitive that business is to WFE versus your increasing base of deployed tools. And then, the question is, if I look at WFE over longer period of time, it was in the low to mid 30s for many years and then in ‘17 and ‘18 it jumped well above that trend to 50 billion plus. And now, this year, they are in the low 40 billion. What I’m trying to understand is, what is the right base line level that when we have let’s 2020 as normal -- quote unquote normal year, do we grow off of the low 40s that we’re right now or do we grow off 50s? How do you conceptually think about modeling WFE growth over the next three to five years?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the subscription question and then turn it over to Dan. So, overall, our service business has grown about 15% compound annual growth rate over the last four years. In 2018, we grew over 20%. What I said in the prepared remarks is we see high single-digit growth in 2019 in a soft market. And part of what helps us is exactly what you talked about is this subscription revenue. We have a higher percentage over half of our business in subscription revenue with long-term agreements. And so, when you’re in a soft market, those long-term agreements versus just selling parts makes a very, very big difference. That’s been a conscious strategy on our part to create value for customers, drive more of these comprehensive service agreements. If you look at 2018, the comprehensive service agreements grew three times faster than the rate of new shipments. So, we have -- we really changed that strategy around five years ago, relative to driving more long-term agreement, subscription type revenue, and even in 2018, it's still growing at a very high rate. It really comes back to creating value for customers, optimizing output, yield, cost. We’ve put a tremendous focus there. And again, we’re getting a lot of traction. So, it’s good for us, and also definitely good for our customers. And I'll turn it over to Dan for the next question.
Dan Durn: Yes. And Vivek, on the second part of your question, I think there is a couple of ways to look at it. If we take a longer-term perspective around WFE and we look at it as a percentage of overall semiconductor revenue and you go back to couple of decades, 2000, WFE as a percentage of semiconductor revenues was about 17%. This was a bit of a peak because our customers were investing in both 200 and 300 millimeter systems. And then, over the course of the next decade as 300 millimeter cut in all the factory automation systems and the way our customers consolidated and became more efficient in operating their footprint of capacity, you saw it come down to about 9% in 2013. Now that all the efficiency gains from 300 millimeter have worked their way through the system, 450 millimeters is not on the roadmap, in the last few years since 2013, that WFE intensity has gone to 11% to 12%. In an environment characterized like we’re in now where we see elevated inventory levels on both the foundry logic side as well as the memory side, and our customers managing in a very disciplined way supply to meet end market demand, we see those inventories come down. And so, I think it's a good set up for 2020. But, I don't think what happens to this year forms the baseline because we do think what's happening this year is shipping below true end market demand as these inventories come down.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from ‎Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joe Moore: I wanted to follow up on the comment that you made about China spending being down and being little bit foundry oriented. There still seems to be quite a bit of desire to build a sovereign memory business and we’ve seen a number of players talk about spending large amounts of money. What do you think it has to -- it's going to take to sort of kick start that effort, and is it a function of the technology being production ready, is it a function of the market environment, creating new spaces, what's the gating factor behind that business starting to grow?
Gary Dickerson: Memory technology, I think, you can see in terms of the 3D NAND ramp is very difficult. Companies that have decades of experience, tremendous technology, deep experience, talent, I mean, those customers had difficulty transitioning from 2D to 3D NAND. And certainly DRAM scaling is extremely difficult right now. So, it just takes a lot of time to build that type of technology base. And you’ll also need experienced talent across many, many different types of the skill set. So, what we said before in terms of China is that China will definitely continue to incrementally spend but it’s going to be years before you see -- if you look at cost for bit, any type of competitiveness on the leading edge is going to take a lot of time to develop the technology, to develop the talent. And in the meantime, again in the foundry logic area, there is a tremendous growth in sensors, IoT, trailing edge technologies. And we see rational spending there ramping in China. And again that's the more of the spending in 2019. So, again, we see increases but as we said before, we don't see a hockey stick. It’s going to take many years to build the talent and technology.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Joe. And operator, I think we have time for two more questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Gary, maybe just following up some of the commentary you’ve made about EUV on this conference call, particularly for the leading edge foundry and the increasing litho intensity in the near term. At the same time, as these leading edge nodes shrink to 10, 7 and 5 nanometers, we’re seeing new materials implementation, stuff like cobalt for interconnects and other new processes being brought on board. Can you discuss a little more specifically Applied Materials capital intensity for its class of segment that even with EUV you will continue to see increases for your business segments on a going forward basis for leading edge logic and foundry?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. As I said earlier on N5 -- really for all the customers, every now they are driving power, performance, area and cost. 2D scaling is one of the ways that they are driving those improvements. And certainly shrinking is part of that; pattern placement techniques to place patterns in the right location are also part of that where we've said before we expect our patterning revenue to grow, we've grown significantly over to last several years. We do still see, if you look across the whole industry, our patterning share to continue to grow for Applied Materials. And then for power and performance, some of the things, I talked about earlier in N5, gate materials, epi, implant, surface treatment technologies. I will tell you, the interfaces are getting very, very difficult. And so, when you look at how you improve power and performance, you’re talking about a few atoms making a very big difference. In some cases, you take wafers out of one process chamber immediately in a matter of seconds or minutes, you have moisture being absorbed into the films, oxidizing; that impacts device performance. So, more of these integrated materials solutions will be the path in terms of how people drive scaling going forward. The 1,000x leakage current example I’ve given is I think a prime example of a huge improvement in power and performance, and that requires a combination of technologies on a platform where Applied has a significant advantage. So, those are the areas we’re focused on. We have many deep conversations with a number of different companies. I meet on a regular basis with all of the R&D leaders. And really, that's the focus for us and creates a big opportunity.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham and Company. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Gary, I just wanted to follow up on the market share comments. Obviously, the mix shift towards EUV hurt supply. But, if you look at the segments in which you compete today, what are your expectations for share gains? Are you flat to still gaining share in those segments? And then, sort of second question is just -- you talked about in the script, you are not yet ready to call the bottom. Just curious, what signs are you looking for before you're ready to call the bottom -- on the semiconductor side?
Dan Durn: Yes. On the semiconductor cycle and calling the bottom, I think what we're looking to in the back part of the year, we've got conversations, deep conversations ongoing with customers. And while we like some of the positive lead indicators we’re seeing, we still see inventory at an elevated level coming down. And if we were to see that come down faster than we’re currently contemplating, utilizations rising, ASP stability, I think those would be all good lead indicators that would look into the back half of 2019 and change the trend lines that we see. And again, if that is the scenario that materializes, we will benefit greatly in that environment.
Gary Dickerson: I think, on the market share question, certainly we’re doing well in the areas we’re competing. But we’re driving to compete in more areas. There are certain areas where there are big TAM expansion opportunities. Those are areas that we’re very focused on. And we’ve talked many times about inflection-focused innovation. There is no question the playbook is changing going forward. It's not all about to 2D scaling. So, whether it's in advanced logic, specialty nodes, like power devices, CMOS, image sensors or scaling new memory technologies, all of those areas are areas that we’re very focused on. They are all dependent on materials innovation. And we’re driving major investments in those new products and also new structures that enable that new playbook. So, that's a big focus for us, and we see it is a great opportunity.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks, Quinn. Any last thoughts, Dan, before we close it up?
Dan Durn: Sure, Mike. Thanks. Just a couple of quick thoughts. First, I want you to know that while the environment is challenging, we feel very good about the structural WFE growth that we see in the years ahead. So, today, we’re going to do the right things that increase the value of the Company. We will drive spend discipline throughout the organization while we’re still investing. We're going to invest in new products and new capabilities. This is about winning, winning in new inflections that we know are going to play out in the growth years we see coming. Second, even though we see some positive lead indicators based on conversations with our customers, we will resist the temptation to call the bottom. What we will do though we’re going to stay close to our customers, we’re going to continue to be transparent; we’re going to continue to be available to you. On that point, we've got the Morgan Stanley conference coming up in a little less than two weeks. I’ll look forward to seeing many of you there, and both Gary and I at many other events throughout the rest of the year. Okay. Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, great. Thanks, Dan. And we’d like to thank everybody for joining us today. The replay of the call is going to be available on our website by 5 p.m. Pacific Time. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and answer-session. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon. We appreciate you joining us for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied's current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of November 15, 2018, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them. Today's call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at AppliedMaterials.com. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. In our fourth fiscal quarter, Applied Materials posted solid results, in line with our guidance. Despite challenging market conditions in the second half of the year, each of our major businesses delivered double-digit growth in fiscal 2018. This would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our employees around the world. And I would like to thank them for all their contributions over the past year. While we expect market headwinds to continue in the near term, we're not seeing the large fluctuations that characterized the semiconductor and display equipment industries in the past. At the same time, we are demonstrating that we have built a more resilient company with diversified revenue streams that can execute well in a range of market conditions. Looking further ahead, we are confident that longer term growth drivers in both semiconductor and display remain firmly in place and will continue to create great opportunities for Applied. During the call today, I'll start with our perspective on near term market dynamics. Then I'll summarize Applied's performance and priorities, and finish by talking about the future growth drivers reshaping our industry, and describing the company's strategy and investments to address the evolving needs of our customers, and the substantial opportunities ahead. Over the past several years, I've shared my perspective that the wafer fab equipment industry has fundamentally changed. Today, it is structurally larger and less volatile than it was in the past. These changes are due to increasingly diverse market drivers, spanning consumer, enterprise and industrial applications. In recent months, however, we've seen several factors negatively impacting industry spending. These include elevated macroeconomic risks, global trade tensions and specific to our industry, a pullback in memory investments. Recent commentary by memory makers has painted a consistent picture. Overall demand in the server, PC and mobile markets is weaker than it was earlier in the year and memory prices are softening in the near term. Our customers tell us they expect demand to pick up and pricing to stabilize in the second half of 2019. I believe the pullback in memory spending we're going through today is different from the down cycles of the past. There were several reasons for this. Supply and demand are relatively well balanced. Customers' investments in capacity are rational and disciplined. And the overall economics of the memory industry remain healthy. In foundry and logic, overall spending levels are strong, as customers optimize capacity at the current nodes, while concurrently pushing forward the leading edge. After a long time in development, the first EUV tools are expected to enter volume production in 2019. To support the initial adoption of EUV, we are seeing additional investments in these long lead-time systems in 2018 and 2019, creating share headwinds for Applied during this period. In aggregate, even with the current challenges I've just described, overall wafer-fab equipment spending remains at consistently high levels. We still believe that 2018 and 2019 combined spending will be around $100 billion. Relative to our prior view, we now see 2018 as slightly higher than 2019. While we are cognizant of macroeconomic and global trade factors, our long-term perspective on major technology trends is unchanged. Fundamental growth drivers are firmly in place as more industries are becoming increasingly dependent on technology, data, and specifically, silicon to define their futures. One of the things that distinguishes Applied from our peers is our broad technology base and the diversity of our products. This provides us with a platform for future growth and the flexibility to deliver solid financial performance in a variety of market conditions. Although our first fiscal quarter will be down sequentially and year-on-year, we will deliver performance that is approximately equivalent to our average quarterly run rate in 2017, when spending patterns were much more favorable for Applied. This is because we've been building out our product portfolio to better address major technology inflections. For example, we significantly improved our position in memory, adding nearly 10 points of market share in the past 5 years. At the same time, we've scaled our service business at a 15% compound annual growth rate over the past 4 years with plenty of headroom for further expansion. Additionally, we've grown our display business at more than 25% compound annual growth over the past 6 years. While our display growth trajectory may not be linear, and as we've previously stated, revenues could be down around 20% in 2019. I feel very good about our future opportunities. Across the company, we're taking a long-term perspective and we continue to prioritize our spending towards R&D, to enable major technology inflections for our customers and drive our long-term growth strategy. I strongly believe that over the next decade A.I. and Big Data will transform almost every sector of the economy, and at the foundation of those changes are electronics and semiconductors. Enabling this A.I.-Big Data future will require new types of computing at the Edge and in the Cloud, lower cost lower powered chips and abundant storage. As classic Moore's Law scaling slows down, the semiconductor industry's traditional playbook is not providing the necessary improvements in power, performance, area and cost. As a result, a new playbook is needed, which includes the development of entirely new chip architectures, new 3D structures within the chip, the integration of new exotic materials, new ways to shrink feature geometries, including EUV lithography and self-aligned patterning, and advanced packaging techniques to connect chips together in new ways. All five of these areas require major advances in materials engineering and create a wealth of opportunity for Applied. As a result, we are evolving our strategy and making investments to position the company to play a larger and more valuable role in the A.I.-Big Data era. We are creating new and unique capabilities for the industry and developing entirely new types of products. Earlier today, we announced plans for our new materials engineering technology accelerator or META Center, which is expected to open in 2019 in New York. The META Center will extend the capabilities of our Mayden Technology Center in Silicon Valley to address the ecosystems growing need to accelerate innovation from materials to systems. This expansion of our R&D infrastructure will allow us to work with system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community in new ways. It's designed to support new types of collaboration from early prototyping to rapid transfer of new technologies from lab to fab. We're already seeing strong pull for earlier and deeper customer engagements, especially for new integrated materials solutions, where we can combine multiple processes together, often within a single system. We are bringing together our broad portfolio of technologies and our ability to understand the interaction between materials creation, materials removal and materials modification to address our customer's increasingly complex integration challenges. I am excited about the value we can create at current, future and trailing nodes. Before I hand the call over to Dan, let me quickly summarize. While the industry is navigating near-term headwinds, spending remains robust. We believe this demonstrates that wafer fab equipment is structurally larger and less cyclical than in the past. Although the current spending patterns within wafer fab equipment do not play to Applied’s strengths, we are still delivering strong financial performance, thanks to the breadth of our product portfolio. We remain focused on positioning the company for the long-term, expanding our role in the A.I.-Big Data era and winning the major technology inflections ahead. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. I'd also like to thank the teams for delivering record revenue and operating profit in fiscal 2018. Today, I'll share my perspective on our industry outlook then summarize our Q4 financial results, provide our Q1 business outlook and discuss the growth investments we're making in upstate New York. As Gary said, overall industry demand is weaker today than in the first half of 2018 and we expect our first quarter results to be lower sequentially. Our guidance includes the impact of a recent export restriction. Without this, we would have guided our semiconductor revenue to be higher sequentially. While we're not ready to call the bottom of the current cycle, we are optimistic that we're not going to see the same kind of volatility we saw in the past, as an industry or as a company. Our semi equipment guidance for Q1 implies annualized WFE in the mid-$40 billion range. It's important to note that this is about $10 billion higher than in all of the years prior to the current cycle. And it reinforces our positive industry thesis, which is based on three core beliefs. First, we see a large market for PCs and mobile devices plus the emergence of a big wave of new demand drivers related to A.I. and Big Data. Second, we believe that after a long downtrend, the capital equipment intensity has stabilized. And third, our customers are more profitable and taking proactive steps to keep supply and demand in balance. We believe the industry is more attractive and the company is more attractive. Over the past six years Applied has built a bigger, more diverse, more resilient business. In fact, in both 2017 and 2018, we delivered more than twice the operating profit of any other year in the past decade. Looking forward to 2019, our customers point to an improving demand outlook in the second half of the year, even if the shape of the recovery off of our Q1 guidance is shallower and more gradual. We believe we will generate higher earnings this fiscal year than in 2017. Our improved profitability enables us to continue making disciplined investments in our future growth opportunities, while simultaneously delivering attractive cash returns to shareholders. Now I'll summarize our Q4 results. We delivered revenue and non-GAAP gross margin that was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. We held non-GAAP OpEx below the midpoint and generated non-GAAP earnings of $0.97 just above the midpoint. Turning to the segments, Semiconductor Systems revenue declined by about 5% year-over-year and was slightly below our expectation. Non-GAAP operating margin declined to 29.6%. Our Global Services business revenue grew by 18% year-over-year to $977 million and non-GAAP operating margin increased to 29.7%. Our Display group delivered $702 million in revenue, which was slightly above our target. Non-GAAP operating margin remained high at 29.3%. Turning to the balance sheet. Operating cash flow improved to 27% or nearly $1.1 billion. We returned $946 million to shareholders, including $751 million in buybacks. We ended the period with $5.6 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, and $4.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. We enter fiscal 2019 with a strong backlog of over $6 billion. Next, I'll provide our Q1 guidance. We expect company revenue to be between $3.56 billion and $3.86 billion. Within the outlook, we expect silicon systems revenue to be down by about 21% year-over-year. Services revenue should be up by about 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, Q1 of 2018 was exceptionally strong for our services business with revenue up 30% over Q1 2017. Our Display revenue should be up by about 10% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of around 44.6% and non-GAAP OpEx of around $750 million plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP earnings should be in the range of $0.75 to $0.83 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate expectation is approximately 12%. As a reminder, this is up nearly 6 points when compared to last year's rate. Now I'll close by discussing the investments we're making in New York. Earlier today, Applied and the state announced plans to create one of the most advanced R&D centers in the world. The META Center will pioneer the materials, process technologies and architectures our customers will need to overcome the industry's scaling challenges. Applied is committed to investing $600 million over the first seven years of the agreement, including both cash and in-kind contributions. Our planned investments will not raise the operating expense targets in our longer term financial model. New York State will invest $250 million to purchase and install tools and equipment. State funding of the META Center is subject to a variety of approvals. And we expect to secure public funding by the end of this calendar year. We intend to ramp up our activities in calendar 2019 and target pilot production in the second half of the year. The META Center will dramatically expand our capacity to collaborate with our customers to accelerate breakthroughs in semiconductor power, performance and cost. Now, Mike, let's begin with Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. Now, to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please pull the operator and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Let's please begin.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question in terms of market share and positioning. So you talked about EUV as a likely headwind into 2019, but also investments you're making in terms of technological inflection. So, curious, can you kind of walk through the timing where we could see a resumption of share gains on the WFE side? And also, as you think about mix in 2019, does that allow you to perhaps at least grow in line? Would love to hear your thoughts, I guess, both 2019 as well as inflections beyond that. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, thanks for the question C.J. Let me give you some color on market share. And I think it's useful to think about three timeframes, what we've done, what we see today and where we're going. When I joined Applied in 2012, we substantially shifted investment towards big inflections. As a result in the 6 years to 2017, we held or increased share for 6 consecutive years. I think we were up five years and flat one. And also, we increased share in memory, where we had a big focus. So we increased our total share of memory spending by about 10 points. So in the near term, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, 2018 we're gaining or holding share in the vast majority of our businesses, but we also see rapid growth in EUV and also in other markets where we don't compete. So as a result, we do expect our share to decline in 2018. After many years of development, we expect to see the first EUV tools used in production beginning in 2019. Those tools have very long lead times and to support the initial adoption, we expect high spending in 2018 and 2019, creating a mix headwind for our overall WFE share. Of course, those long lead-time shipments also are a positive indicator for our future business. And another thing you talked C.J. about mix and other important near-term factor to think about is 3D NAND spending. Once that recovers, the mix will become a lot more favorable for us. And then over - the last thing is over the longer term, over the last couple of months I've spent time with many customers, and still believe that the industry needs a new playbook beyond 2D scaling. And I deeply believe that Applied is in the best position to enable this new playbook. I heard this from all of the customers I met over the last couple of months. And we've all seen classic Moore's Law scaling slowing. All the customers in the industry want more ways to drive PPAC, power, performance, area and cost. So as we've communicated before, we're driving a new playbook that includes five different techniques that I've been talking about, including developing entirely new chip architectures, new 3D structures within the chip, the integration of new materials, new ways to shrink including EUV and self-aligned patterning, and advanced packaging techniques to connect chips together in new ways. All five of those areas require major advances in materials engineering and create great growth opportunities for Applied. As a result of that, we're creating new and unique capabilities for the industry, investing in the META Center to accelerate materials to systems, where there's tremendous value and developing entirely new types of products that move the needle for our customers and for Applied.
Dan Durn: And it's fair to say the mix is hard to predict right now, C.J. So it will depend on what happens in 2019, 2020 in terms of things like 3D NAND like Gary said. So I think we'll stay tuned on trying to make that prediction this early in the year. Thanks.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Atif Malik from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gary, I have a question for you on display. Can you talk about the puts and takes for your down 20% display outlook next year? We hear LG and Samsung ramping and converting capacity on Gen 8 OLED TVs with some weakness on the flexible Gen 6 lines. Also, you guys launched a couple of new products at OLED World Summit, where e-beam, CD metrology and e-beam [indiscernible], so just your thoughts on display market next year?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks for the question, Atif. So happy to give you a color on our display business, as we've said before we've grown display a tremendous amount over the last 6 years, at about 25% compound annual growth rate. For 2019, we've talked about the business declining in the range of 15% to 20%. And given the elevated risk, I believe we're likely to be at the low end of that range. So then, if you go into the different segments, in the TV segment, I continue to expect our customers will transition to Gen 10.5 technology, because it's strategically important for them to deliver lower costs for large screen TVs. And as we've previously communicated with Gen 10.5 panels, you can produce 8 65 inch TVs and you only get 3 on a Gen 8.5 panel. So for large screen TVs, it is strategically compelling to move to those larger panel sizes. And recent discussions with customers, we don't see any change in customers' plans. In the smartphone area, demand is going to be flat year-over-year. But we continue to see OLED is the best technology for the future for a number of different reasons. And we believe that OLED will recover as more suppliers are able to produce at a higher yield. So overall, we see a lot of good opportunities that continue to drive our display business, despite 2019 for the first time in I think 7 years seeing a decline in the business.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Atif.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Please go ahead.
Pierre Ferragu: Hey, thank you for taking my question. Gary, I have a question for you, a follow-up on your comments about share movements and EUV. And then, I have a quick follow-up for Dan. So I'm trying to reconcile what you just described and that makes a lot of sense, so EUV is ramping. You're mechanically losing share in that context. But you're expecting to regain share when you bring materials technology that will go along with EUV lithography. But at the same time, in the last few weeks, I heard like TSMC, I mean, reiterating they said, that's for longer, so like a large foundry player that they don't expect CapEx to grow significantly. Then your peer ASML is saying the same. And so, does that mean you have a different perspective and you think overall CapEx is going to continue to grow in foundry significantly and even grow faster than revenues?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, thanks for the question. So I think our perspective longer term, Pierre, hasn't changed. And I've spent many, many meetings with customers over the last couple of months. We strongly believe that the industry needs a new playbook. And that, all of those five techniques I talked about earlier are absolutely crucial to deliver power, performance, area and cost needed for this Big Data-A.I. era. Now, silicon and electronics are going to be at the foundation of all of those major industry transformations, changing in a profound way all the aspects of our life. We still definitely believe that. And if you look at where we need to go with a 1,000 times improvement of performance per watt, you can look certainly at what we've said in the past. You can look at what other people are saying also that they talk about those five areas of focus. And I deeply believe we're in a better position longer term than we've ever been. Now, certainly there's a headwind in 2018 and 2019. After a long time, you have the initial adoption of long lead-time EUV tools. They'll go into production for the first time in 2019. That's going to certainly provide a headwind for us in the near term, but longer term, I definitely believe the industry is not going to get where we need to go with doing what we've done in the past. I think it's also very clear with Moore's Law - classic Moore's Law slowing down that you have to drive this new playbook and there is tremendous value in going from materials to systems at a much faster rate. And again, everything I've heard in meetings with customers over the last couple of months, totally reiterates that that's the right strategy. And so that's my thought.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Pierre. And I think, Pierre, you said you might have had a follow-up for Dan. I don't know if you still do, just checking. Okay, hearing no response. Let's move on.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar from Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Gary, it looks like the general view that next year the mix of WFE is going to skew more towards foundry and logic versus memory. In that scenario, is it fair to assume that your profitability profile or your margin profile should be better selling into foundry, logic versus memory? And then a quick housekeeping for Dan. What's the impact from export control on Fujian? Was it about $100 million for you guys? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Krish. Let me share with you a little bit of what we're seeing around the WFE market and then come to the profitability - the implications that, that has for the profitability of the company. So in the prepared comments, we talked about 2018 and 2019 combined being around $100 billion. I would say, given the elevated risk profile of the environment, we find ourselves in, that's - our expectations around 2019 have probably softened in the last three months. We now see 2019 below 2018. If I were to - and I think it's premature to be point specific on either 2018, 2019 or the device types. But again, to just share a little bit of what we're thinking to help shape a view of the market. 2019 feels more like 2017 than it does 2018. And if I look at where we sit today in 2018 WFE, all-time high, in terms of aggregate spend and strength across each of the four device types. And as I profile off of that view into 2019, we would expect memory to be down and foundry, logic to be up. And then if I were to rank order the four device types as we look into 2019, given everything we see today, foundry would be the strongest, then followed by logic, then followed by DRAM, then followed by NAND. In terms of profitability, I think the best way to think about our business is less about end market profiling the four device types and more about the mix amongst our businesses, the more of our leadership businesses and equipment that we sell, you'll see that be a favorable segment mix - or a favorable product mix within the segment. The less leadership businesses - or the less leadership products we sell, will certainly be a headwind from a margin perspective. So I'd look at it more as a product mix influenced as opposed to end markets.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Okay. And then the other part of the question was around this recent action that was directed by a particular Chinese customer. From what we see today, this feels like business as usual for the other customers in the region. And then regarding the geopolitical situation, we certainly believe in fair trade. And we think it's important for the overall ecosystem to have a constructive relationship between the U.S. and China. We can't speculate on any other actions that could take place. And, of course, we continuously monitor the situation and we're going to respond appropriately. And then, Dan, do you want to give color on the magnitude of the impact?
Dan Durn: Sure, Gary. So as we think about our guide into Q1 and we think about the export action that was taken against the one specific customer, we - a quarter ago we're expecting our semi business to be flat to up sequentially. We guided down a bit. In the absence of this export restriction, we would have been up sequentially in our semi systems business into Q1. And I would say that our revenue with that one customer in Q1 is a meaningful number. So the EPS guidance we provided into Q1 reflects a significant reduction in semiconductor revenue along with an unfavorable mix within the product portfolio. And I think that gives you a sense of the impact of that action on the one customer. I don't think, we want to be more specific, since it's a direct read-through on one customer. But I think that's enough to give you a sense of what the impact to our company was in our fiscal Q1.
Michael Sullivan: All right. Thanks, Krish.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Gary, Dan, to the extent in your prepared comments, I think you said you're not prepared to call the January quarter - January guidance a bottom. I'm wondering was that relative to the overall Applied revenue stream, the silicon business? Was that a sequential comment or a year-over-year comment? I guess, specifically with the silicon business, Dan, being down over 20% year-over-year, I believe, relative to your Jan guidance. Do you think that that will represent a year-over-year bottom that we can start to build off of? Or how should we think about that?
Dan Durn: Thanks, John. Let me share with you a little bit of what we're seeing in the market, and hopefully, it helps provide some context and color that gets at the essence of what you're asking about. I would say based on our customer conversations, and the guidance we gave about not calling the bottom is specifically related to our semi business, because I think that's where the biggest question in the market is today. Based on the customer conversations we're having, we think that first half 2019 would likely be higher than second half 2018. But we also think given the elevated risk profile, we - or the elevated risk environment, we find ourselves in geopolitical trade, handsets industrials being on the weaker side, that certainly offset by decent markets in PC, comm infrastructure, cloud CapEx. But as a package creates an elevated risk profile, we think it's prudent to create an expectation around a shallow, gradual, U-shaped recovery of the semi business into 2019. And so for a variety of reasons, I don't think we want to put a stake in the ground and call it a definitive bottom. But, we like what we see and are trying to be prudent in expectation setting.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. If you have your phone on mute, please unmute your line.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Despite the equipment, Dan, on this China domestic DRAM that you guys are talking about here in Q1, there are - these two other major programs in China, one in NAND, one in DRAM that are potentially looking to kind of ramp next year. I think, last quarter you guys said that 2019 China domestic was looking more kind of heavily weighted towards foundry, has your view changed in light of some - has your view changed in light of this activity with some of the other memory suppliers that are looking to potentially ramp both NAND and DRAM capabilities, maybe starting second half of next year?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Yeah, as I said earlier, we don't really see any change in the activities with the other customers in the region. Of course, we're going to continuously monitor that and respond to anything that we need to respond to, but one thing, I may be helpful if I give you color on our China business, how it's composed. So our Display, we have a large display business in China and a little less than half of our revenue is semi systems, roughly half of that is multinational, the other half is domestic and for domestic, we're fairly balanced between foundry, logic and memory. And when we look ahead to 2019 and beyond, consistent with what we've said before, we didn't see a hockey stick, in terms of growth in the domestic market and we continue to see modest growth in the semi market going forward. So, I would say, at least today, we don't see any change in behavior with our customers, and that's basically the profile of the different parts of our business, which is pretty consistent with what we've said before.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
Romit Shah: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. My question is on services. So services had a pretty strong year in fiscal 2018, looks like it was up about 25% year-on-year and you're guiding it down sequentially a bit for January, if I interpret it your comments correctly. My question is, does the services at some point in fiscal 2019, start to track the performance of SSG in fiscal 2018 and should we be cognizant of that as we model out the quarters of this coming fiscal year?
Dan Durn: Hi, Romit. Thanks for the question. I think the best way to think about services growth, certainly the installed base is an influencer, but it's not a direct read through. So I don't think that business will directly track the following year, what our systems business does the prior year. But there is a growth vector around the installed base, there is a growth vector around the increasing complexity that the industry is facing and the challenges our customers are increasingly asking for help with their drive yields. And the third is the strategy we have around comprehensive service agreements to get a bit more predictability in the business versus the transactional nature, and so it's a multi-vector approach and strategy to grow in the business. You point out that the company has done a great job executing that strategy, 2018 was a strong year. And our goal will be to grow that, continue to grow that business at a 15% CAGR on a go-forward basis. So it's a business we feel good about, but I don't think you can make a direct read through based on systems in any one year.
Romit Shah: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Gary, if I look longer term, what is your relative exposure to the smartphone market directly, indirectly versus the enterprise or data center, because when I look over the last five years of growth in the semi-cap equipment industry, it kind of coincided with the growth of high-end smartphones. But as they are slowing down, when can the enterprise and data center will be big enough to offset those declines. And do you think it is possible that WFE kind of stays flattish for the next two to three years, because of this dynamic?
Dan Durn: Yeah. Thanks, Vivek. As we take a step back from what drives WFE, if we were to go back a decade in our industry, vast majority of WFE was narrowly focused in and around the PC platform. Since then we've diversified into mobility compute handsets, we've got a lag in the data center, you can see big data cloud service providers beginning to influence that, IoT is playing an increasingly large portions of semiconductor consumption as is - as are things like autonomous driving and Industry 4.0. It's really hard to disaggregate those long-term technology trends that are increasingly depending on silicon and consuming silicon to a direct read through on WFE, that chain is extremely hard to disaggregate and attribute one to the other. The second thing I would say is, units in the handsets clearly are slowing down, content gains are still happening, and so we do see favorable trends in that industry. What I like is the broadening of the end market demand drivers that support our industry. And so as you take a look at how 2017 profile to 2018 and now a quick look into 2019, you can see that our industry is structurally larger, even though the adjustments are headwinds in any given period or quarter are coming from different areas. You can see that, that diversification is serving the industry well, in terms of moderating a bit of the volatility the industry has seen historically. I would say as we roll the clock forward and we take a point of view on what we think aggregates semiconductor demand is going to be in this world. This is an industry that's $450 billion-ish today. It's going to be $600 billion, $700 billion, $800 billion at some point in the future, manufacturing capacity to produce the wafers and chips that support an industry that sized at those levels. It's going to be a very favorable trend for our industry. So if we were to be sitting here in 2025, talking about a $50 billion WFE, I would be extremely disappointed about that given what we know today.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Vivek.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks so much. Dan, I just had a question about the share repo. I think, you bought back about $3.7 billion over the past six months at quite a bit higher prices than this, but you only bought back $750 million this quarter at much lower prices. So I'm just wondering what the strategy is going forward on the share repo? Thanks so much.
Dan Durn: Yeah. Thanks, Tim. So what we said about our capital allocation strategy is, we're going to focus our excess cash on growing the company, maintaining a strong and healthy balance sheet and then returning excess cash to shareholders. I think what you see is us executing against that strategy. If you narrow the timeframe to any given quarter, the share repurchase may or may not be above where we trade on any given day. If we take a look at what the company has done over a long period of time in the last two decades, we've given back close to 90% of our free cash flow back to shareholders. Our shares peaked at 1.7 billion shares outstanding; today it's under 1 billion. This is something the company has done for a very long time, not a new policy. And if you look at our three-year track record, the company has given back about $8 billion and we've repurchased almost 20% of the company at an average price of $37. And so I think over the long run, the company has been disciplined and respectful of shareholders in the way in which we manage our free cash flow.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on your market share comments. You talked about headwinds given the insertion of EUV. But, Gary, do you have any expectations for your positioning in the markets that you do participate in, [etch depth] [ph], CMP, Epi. Is it fair to say that your competitive positioning is still improving in the markets that you actually serve? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Toshiya. We actually, in 2018, were gaining our holding share in the vast majority of our businesses that where we compete today. There are markets that we don't compete and we have initiatives in those areas that where we have very strong pull from customers and we're optimistic that over time that that will provide a significant increase in business for us. And then, the other thing I would say probably the biggest factor longer term is this new playbook, I mentioned, with the five different drivers, that is really playing to the strengths - uniquely to the strength of Applied Materials with the breadth of our products, all the different materials creation, materials removal, materials modification and also the ability to combine all of these different technologies together in a single platform, where you manage these interfaces that is a really, really, really valuable capability. I met with all of our large customers in the last two, three months. Many times people running R&D, some of the feedback I was getting was just tremendous. People saying things that they didn't think were possible, relative to power, performance, area and cost. So those things will not play out in 2018 and not so much in 2019, but really that is the big driver for the industry. This new play book going forward is extremely important. And Applied is in a very unique position to enable those capabilities. So that's why we are investing. That's why we announced the META Center. And the goal is really to drive materials to systems many times faster than we are at today. We think there's tremendous value there. And, certainly, that's the feedback that we're getting from customers.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Toshiya.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joseph Moore: Great, thank you. My question is on DRAM. I guess, it seems like your DRAM numbers year-to-date have been quite strong in terms of you are sales to DRAM company despite the push-outs that we've seen. And if we aggregate kind of three equipment companies who shift to DRAM there, they are all showing pretty significant strength up in aggregate, I think over 60%. So, I guess, I understand capital intensity is increasing, but it doesn't seem like it was inflecting that much in any one year. So how is DRAM despite even with push-outs having such a robust year? And, I guess, does that mean supply would accelerate next year? Does it - anything that you would tell us about the sustainability of that into 2019 would be helpful? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Joe. As we look at our position in DRAM, it gets back to a bit of the journey that gets us to where we're at from a market share standpoint today. As Gary talked, since he came into the company or when he came into the company, we had one end-market that was over 20% from a market share standpoint. All others were 15% or below. And the company has done a very good job diversifying across those device types to where we're almost diagnostic across the device types from a market-share standpoint. And DRAM has been one of the beneficiaries. The company's worked really hard with customers to deliver innovation when their roadmaps require it. And it's allowed us to increase our market share with those customers. We're increasingly seeing in the periphery transistors logic-like processes being adopted to drive I/O speeds on the devices. And that accrues benefits to us as well in some of our higher market share businesses. And so, the setup around DRAM going forward is a good one for us. It's been good over the last several years. And as you pointed out, we've done a good job driving market share there. And we like that setup going forward as well. So we like the progress we're making in DRAM.
Gary Dickerson: And then, Joe, if you're looking for the year-over-year in DRAM, we've been planning for it to be sort of into 2019, maybe not quite the 20% that we've seen, maybe it's high teens to 20%. And very good job right now for the customers, doing very proactive supply and demand management, and also a lot of pull for DRAM, especially the high-speed versions in the server market. So from the customer conversations, it feels pretty good, it feels not as tight as it was. But really proactive steps and it looks like a decent outlook for next year. We think it's still going to be a strong year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho from Stifel. Please go ahead.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Gary, maybe just a follow-up on the playbook, you're talking about with the five key factors in terms of the architecture and the structures within chips and continued materials innovation. Given your strong exposure to the foundry logic segment, do you believe some of these variables would come into play at the 5-nanometer node? Or is this something that, I guess, past 5-nanometers that we will see it more in the next decade?
Gary Dickerson: Patrick, I think, the great thing about many of those drivers, is they're not only for future technology nodes, you can use those in - some of those drivers can make a big difference, move the needle on current devices, and also on trailing geometries, even planar transistors. So that's - and we are seeing strong pull from customers across the board for some of those major drivers at the AI Design Forum in July and at the Electronics Resurgence Initiative, the DARPA Conference in July. One of the examples we gave was 1,000 times improvement in leakage current. Again, many of these new technologies that we're driving can be used in trailing geometries and even current geometries. So we don't need to wait for the adoption of 3-nanometer or - and, certainly, some of those technologies will be targeted for leading technology nodes, but some of them can be used today.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Patrick. And, operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to an earlier question on profitability. You guided gross margin at 44.6% and that's quite a bit lower than your fiscal 2020 model, 47%. I understand, it's less about end-market and more about product mix between leadership and growth products. But can you explain what situation will lead you to see higher growth for your leadership products versus growth? And I would assume first half of 2019 you'll see growth business a little slower because of memory spending, and maybe display revenue is already at lower level. Just trying to think about what's the path for you to get to the fiscal 2020 margin target from here? How much is driven by mix versus volume?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah, thanks, Sidney. Yeah, let me try to unpack that and walk through this systematically. If there's anything I leave out, please follow up. What I would say about gross margins, we've done a good job over the last handful of years. We've increased the gross margin by about 500 basis points, Q4 gross margin in line with our guidance. And as you know, actual gross margins in any given quarter are going to be a function of several factors. There is revenue level, segment, product mix, customer mix, factory activity. All of those will vary quarter-to-quarter. We are seeing Q1 as part of our guide sequentially lower from a revenue standpoint. AGS continues to be a growing part of the mix. And we talked about an ERP transition throughout 2018 to risk mitigate customer deliveries at a point of the cycle, where the supply chain was very tight. We kept an elevated level of inventory to make sure our customer needs were covered. We're going to be bringing that factory activity level down over the next three, four quarters to bring that inventory more in line with the natural progression. And so, clearly there is a number of factors at play. And I guess, the thing I would point to the most is, aggregate revenue level, and then how that revenue profiles across our various products and amongst our segments are going to be the largest influencer to gross margin. Company has done a good job driving those margins historically. I wouldn't look to too much in any one given quarter and we're going to continue to work hard and make progress and continue to drive gross margins off at these levels.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, great. Sidney. Thanks for the question. Dan, before we close the call, anything else you'd like to add, just so we wrap up on time?
Dan Durn: Yeah, thanks, Mike. I guess I want to close with a couple of thoughts. First, we all know that we're in a challenging environment. I think the company has delivered strong results in 2018. But we're definitely not satisfied. We know we still have a lot of work to do and we're going to work aggressively to achieve the goals we set for the company. I guess the second thing is, is if we fast forward to a year from now, when we look back at our Q1 results, they may prove to be the low point of the year. But we're not ready to call Q1 the bottom until we have collected multiple proof points across a variety of our businesses. I think if you look at sort of the company's and the way we've engaged in the past, many of you that follow our journey, you know our style is to be transparent. Our goal, our intent is to help you see what we see. As tougher as the environment feels right now, the industry is substantially higher than it was even compared to prior peaks. We're confident that our long-term thesis around the industry, the long-term technology trends are going to be favorable and they're firmly in place. We also believe we've built the more resilient business. A company that is more profitable. It allows us to invest and uniquely be well positioned to drive the industry inflections that we already see on the horizon. I guess lastly, finally, look forward to seeing many of you at the Credit Suisse conference in a couple of weeks. Thanks very much.
Michael Sullivan: All right. Thanks, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for attending today's conference. This concludes the program, you may all disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. I’m Mike Sullivan, Head of Investor Relations at Applied Materials. We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter of fiscal 2018 earnings call, which is being recorded. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO and Dan Durn, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today’s call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied’s current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied’s most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management’s estimates, projections and assumptions as of August 16, 2018, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them. Today’s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today’s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our Web site at appliedmaterials.com. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Mike. I’m pleased to report that our revenue for the quarter was up 19% compared to the same period last year and the second highest in the Company's history. Fiscal 2018 remains on track to be another record setting year for Applied Materials, and we expect each of our major businesses to deliver strong double-digit growth. In today's call, I’ll start by providing our perspective on the market environment and our business performance. Then I’ll lay out our views on the industry's future growth drivers and describe how we’re evolving our strategy to take full advantage of the tremendous opportunities ahead. In aggregate, we see ongoing strength in our markets. Customers are making rational investments in new capacity resulting in well balanced supply demand dynamics. At the same time, they are aggressively pursuing their development roadmaps with healthy spending on next generation technologies. Demand for wafer fab equipment is on track to be an all-time record in 2018, and our view of 2019 remains positive, our thesis that spending in 2018 plus 2019 combined will exceed $100 billion remains firmly intact. The details within our 2018 forecast are consistent with the view we shared during our last call with the exception of a recent downward revision to our foundry outlook. As foundry customers optimize existing capacity, they’ve trimmed their capital spending plans for the year. They are still pushing forward with leading-edge developments, prioritizing current investment towards long lead time equipment, which is a positive leading indicator for 2019. NAND bit demand is expected to grow at about 40% this year with bit supply growing slightly faster. As a result, we see spending levels flat to modestly down from last year's record levels. DRAM investments are strong, up approximately 50% year-over-year as customers invest in capacity and technology to meet growing demand for high-performance DRAM for data centers. Capital investments by the leading cloud service providers continues to strengthen, up about 85% year to date compared to 2017. And in line with our prior view we also expect, logic investments to be higher this year. Stepping back and looking at the broader context, 2018 shows how the industry has fundamentally changed over the past five years. More diverse demand drivers spanning consumer and enterprise markets combined with very disciplined investment has reduced cyclicality. We’re not seeing the large fluctuations in wafer fab equipment spending that we did in the past. Over the same time period, we've also driven significant changes within Applied that have resulted in a larger, less volatile and more resilient business. In semiconductor, we've gained 7 points of market share in memory since 2013, while maintaining our traditionally strong position in logic foundry. As a result, we are now very well balanced across market segments. We’ve built the strong portfolio of products that addressed major technology inflections. For example, by developing tools for next generation multi patterning, we have grown our patterning business in DRAM, logic and foundry from about $100 million in 2013 to more than $1 billion this year. We expect our patterning opportunity to grow by another billion dollars as EUV and new materials enabled patterning steps are adopted over the next five years. In display, we have scaled the business from about $600 million in 2012 to approximately $2.5 billion this year. In both TV and mobile, customers are investing in new technologies and that plays directly to Applied’s strengths. We expect display to remain a powerful growth driver for the Company over the long-term. In Service, we have grown revenue at 15% compound annual growth rate since 2014. As we look ahead we’re confident that we can sustain at least that pace of growth, driven by our growing install base, customers placing a larger portion of tools under long-term service agreements and new advanced service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield and optimize operating costs. When look at the Company as a whole, about 40% of our revenue today comes from sources other than new semiconductor equipment sales. Combined, our services, spares, upgrades, consulting, software and display and flexible technology businesses, will generate more than $7 billion of revenue this year. This ramp and diversity gives us confidence in our ability to sustain strong performance under a variety of market conditions and provide a great platform for future growth. I strongly believe that the most exciting days for the industry and Applied are ahead of us. Over the next decade, AI and Big Data will transform almost every sector of the economy and be a major growth driver for electronics and semi conductors. AI is already driving a significant increase in hardware research and investment from a broad range of companies, because it requires new computing at the edge and in the cloud, lower cost, lower power chips and abundant storage. In these early innings of AI, the industry is focused on addressing two major technology inflections; first, the development of new computing architectures customized for specific training or inference workloads; and second, overcoming the deceleration of Moore's Law scaling. This is driving new types of innovation across the ecosystem. We believe that future improvements in chip performance, power, area and costs needed to enable the AI era will be driven by a combination of five factors; new chip architectures; new structures within the chip, including 3D; new materials; new ways to shrink chip geometries, including EUV lithography and self-aligned patterning; and new ways to connect chips together, using advanced packaging techniques. All five of these approaches will require major advances in materials engineering and create huge opportunities for applied. The AI Big Data era is a catalyst for applied to play a bigger and broader role than ever before. Our first priority is to be the most valuable partner for our customers. The introduction of more novel materials, combined with new structures to improve performance and costs, means that integration challenges in the chip manufacturing process are increasingly complex. Our broad portfolio of technology and our ability to understand the interaction between materials creation, materials removal and materials modification is tremendously valuable. As a result, we are seeing customers engaging Applied in earlier and deeper collaborations to develop unique solutions, focused on device performance and yield. One example of how we’re doing this is integrated material solutions, where we can combine multiple processes together, typically within a single system. We launched our first integrated material system in June, but this is just the start. We have a very robust pipeline of integrated products, several of which we expect to come to market in 2019. We’re also expanding our engagements within the AI ecosystem and finding new ways to create value with our technology. For example, we recently announced collaboration with ARM to develop a neuromorphic switch that can enable new approaches to AI computing. This program is part of DARPA's electronics resurgence initiative to develop new computing materials, designs and architectures. In July, we hosted the industry's first AI Design Forum with over 700 attendees spanning system architects, chip designers and the manufacturing community. The common message from participants was that the ecosystem needs to work together in new ways to bring AI technologies to market faster and at lower cost. Applied has highly differentiated technologies and capabilities to accelerate new materials and systems like our Maydan Technology Center that enables rapid testing of new concepts and designs. To further accelerate materials innovation and our ability to connect across the ecosystem, we’re expanding capacity and capabilities. In addition, we’re applying AI and Big Data methods within our own research and development teams. We’re partnering with leading AI companies and making infrastructure investments to significantly increase learning rates. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I’ll quickly summarize. Industry fundamentals remain strong, with customers making disciplined investments in capacity and new technologies, Applied's performance remain strong. 2018 will be another record year for all of our major businesses, and our outlook for 2019 is positive and we see a very bright future ahead. We’re expanding engagements with current and new customers to position the Company to play a larger and more valuable role in the AI, Big Data era. Now, Dan will give his perspective on our performance and outlook.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. In Q3, Applied delivered revenue and non-GAAP earnings that were both within 2% of the all-time records we set last quarter. On a year-over-year basis we generated strong revenue growth, and increased non-GAAP EPS by 40%, even as our memory customers made capacity adjustments during the period. We continue to see the wafer fab equipment market and Applied Materials being sustainably larger and less cyclical today than in the past and as Gary outlined, our outlook for 2019 and the longer term remains very positive. Given the adjustments in memory markets along with recent foundry CapEx reductions, I want to offer you a little help this quarter with how we see demand profiling from 2018 into 2019. My philosophy is to tell you what I see today based on our market analysis and customer engagements. I can't guarantee what happens in the economy in policy circles or in our markets, but I’m happy to be transparent with you and let you make your own judgment about the external factors. Our fiscal Q4 business outlook calls for semiconductor systems revenue to decline by about 4% year-over-year with non-GAAP earnings to increase by about 3% year-over-year at the midpoint to $0.96. From what I can see today, semiconductor systems revenue will be flat to slightly higher sequentially in Q1. Non-GAAP earnings will be slightly higher sequentially in Q1 as well, even when you include $0.05 headwind from an increase in our tax rate that takes effect in fiscal 2019. Our current outlook in the Q2 and the balance of fiscal 2019 is for continued growth. Returning to the bigger picture Gary described. You may notice how resilient the industry and the Company have become, particularly given the supply and demand adjustments now taking place in memory. Some of us remember the steep cyclicality of the past, but here's the news. We expect trough non-GAAP quarterly earnings of $0.96 in Q4. To put this into perspective, $0.96 also happens to be the average of our full-year earnings in the six years from 2010 through 2015. We can now generate the same level of earnings in a single quarter. This comparison demonstrates the benefits of Applied's breadth and growth. In semi, while our memory systems revenue declined by 19% sequentially in Q3, our overall systems business was down by half that amount. This demonstrates the benefits of our balanced revenue share across device types. Applied’s display business has grown nearly $2 billion as compared to 2012, and the best indication of Applied’s resilience is our services business. This quarter, AGS posted its 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. In fact, Applied has the industry's largest install base of more than 40,000 systems, and we’re shipping over 2,000 new 300 millimeter systems this year alone. This year's record shipments will further expand our services opportunity next year. In fact, due to the increasing trust our customers are placing in our services products, we are now generating about half of our services revenue from long-term agreements. I am sometimes asked to quantify the total proportion of our semi-related business that comes from servicing the install base. The answer is 32%. That’s AGS excluding display services plus 300 millimeter upgrades in refurbishments, which are reported as part of our semiconductor systems group segment. So Applied generates more install base revenue than any other company in our industry. Now let’s summarize our third quarter results. We generated operating income of $1.3 billion, which was up 22% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP EPS was $1.20 which was $0.03 above the midpoint benefiting from higher revenue, as well as lower tax rate and share count. Turning to the segments, our semiconductor systems group delivered revenue that was slightly above the midpoint of our expectations. Our services revenue was up 21% year-over-year, which was slightly lower than the midpoint of our Q3 expectations, but well above our long-term growth target. AGS posted another all-time record in both revenue and operating income. Our display group delivered revenue that was slightly above the midpoint and also set new records in both revenue and operating income. Turning to the balance sheet. Gary talked about the many initiatives we’re driving to accelerate innovation. We invested $133 million in capital improvements that were primarily aimed at expanding our capabilities in both R&D and manufacturing to support our customers. This quarter, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders. We paid out the first $0.20 dividend and we used $1.25 billion to repurchase 25 million shares of our stock. Over the last 12 months alone, we've repurchased 92 million shares, or 9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of that period. And we still have about $5 billion remaining in buyback authorization. Now I’ll share our business outlook for Q4. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4.15 billion. Within the outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue to decline by about 4% year-over-year. This forecast includes the impact of recent foundry CapEx reductions. Our services revenue should increase by about 15% year-over-year, and our display revenue should grow by about 2% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP gross margin should be around 45.4% and our non-gap operating expenses should be in the range of $765 million plus or minus $10 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.92 to $1. Now that you have our financial expectations for the full 2018 fiscal year and our positive view of 2019, I'd like to give you an interim update on our 2020 financial model, in the context of the new opportunities Gary has been describing. Q3 was a very busy quarter for us and I was delighted to see more than 160 of you at our investor breakfast at Semicon West. At the AI Design Forum, Gary shared the stage with Nvidia, IBM and many of the world's top experts and startups. Two weeks later, Gary joined Nvidia, Intel and others at the DARPA ERI Summit, showing how we can use materials engineering to accelerate AI, even as Moore's Law slows. DARPA awarded millions of dollars to Applied, Arm and our research partners to explore new material for neuromorphic computing. These are early indications of the work we are now going to drive growth for our Company and our customers. So based on the current view of our markets, our evolving strategy and our financial performance, we are confident that we will exceed our goal of earning $5.08 per share in our 2020 fiscal year. Specifically, we expect semi-systems revenue to be more than $11.6 billion in fiscal 2020. We believe $50 billion in the new normal for this industry. And that WFE will keep pace with the revenue growth of the industry. We also expect services plus display revenue of more than $8 billion. Within the mix, we see services revenue being above our prior expectations, fully offsetting display revenue, which we expect to be in 2020 but still below our original target. We continue to expect gross margin of 47% and operating margin of 29.6% our non GAAP tax rate should be slightly higher than the prior expectations of 10% due to the new tax rules. Additionally, our share count is already below $1 billion versus the original goal of $1.024 billion. And we’ll continue to return excess cash to our investors. Now I turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. And now to help us reach as many of you as, we can please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please just call the operator, we’ll do our best to answer it later in the call. Let’s please begin.
Operator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: I guess for my question, can you talk to just adjustments that you saw both memory and foundry recently. And then as you think about calendar ’19, can you discuss the puts and takes in terms of how you’re seeing each of the end markets, whether foundry, logic, DRAM, NAND. And as part of that if you could include your thoughts around clean room availability and timing of investments through the calendar year? Thank you.
Dan Durn: Given the announcements in the last month, we’re now seeing some movements in foundry capital spending. That's reflected in the guidance we just provided for fiscal Q4. All other assumptions from last quarter still holds true. To give you more color on what we're seeing in foundry, we continue to see growth in trailing node geometries. The split between leading edge and trailing node geometries historically was 80-20 then it became 60-40. Today, it’s more like 50-50. And specifically, in 2018, we see trailing node spend up and leading edge node spend down. And on the leading edge, we’re seeing a prioritization towards spend to very long lead time items, which we believe is a good indicator of our business going into 2019 and beyond. In 2019, we expect both leading and trailing node geometries to be healthy. When we look at 2018 and 2019, just to provide the broader context; 2017 was an all-time record; 2018 is likely to be the new record being up over '17; and we’re seeing strength across all device types. Gary, in his prepared comments said 2018 plus 2019 combined will exceed $100 billion. And I think it’s too early to make a point estimate on either year. But based on customer conversations we’re having, 2019 will be above $50 billion and still healthy across all device types. And so we're really seeing a strong end market and how things profile into 2019.
Gary Dickerson: And I think C.J. I might add a comment something about capacity at the fab level for some of it. So I think [multiple speakers] view hasn’t really changed.
Dan Durn: Yes, so the best I can get to from a capacity standpoint is we’re tracking 32, 300 mm factories around the globe that still have to be facilitized. The average size of those 31 fabs is about 72,000 wafer starts per month and it represents about 200 billion of potential floor space for WFE equipment. So in terms of ability to deploy capacity in a fairly rapid fashion, I think the infrastructure and the build is out there. I think it’s just a matter of letting the demand led environment lead our customers’ investment profile to maintain rational supply demand dynamics and strong pricing in their markets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Dan, thank you for updating us on the $5 2020 target model. I have a question on the display segment. It looks like you guys are on track to do 30% year-over-year growth for fiscal '18. On the last earnings call, you guys talked about the decline of 15% to 20% for fiscal '19. I was curious if anything has changed to that outlook in the mobile or the DE markets? Thank you.
Dan Durn: So our display forecast is really unchanged similar to what we communicated previously. As you said, '18 is going to be around $2.5 billion, up more than 30% from the previous year and up from $600 million in 2012, so tremendous growth overall in display. And we still see 2019 down in the 15% range and 2020 to be higher than 2018. In terms of mix, 2018-2019 is more weighted towards TV and one thing I’d remind everybody for large-screen TVs, if you compare Gen 10.5 to Gen 8.5 you get eight TVs versus three. So our view on the TV market is similar to what we previously communicated. And overall again we see 2020 up over 2018 continue to see display as a great growth driver for the company. Future technology inflections are more capital-intensive and we have a pipeline of new capabilities that create a strong opportunity for future growth.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu of Newstreet Research. Your line is now open.
Pierre Ferragu: I’d like to come back very rapidly on C.J.’s question and really make a difference between memory and logic. So if I understood you correctly than what you're saying is that in memory what you saw three months ago and that led you to tell us you could reasonably expect sequential growth between Q3 and Q4 in semiconductor system, that outlook didn’t change which meant that the low points in memory was Q3 and things should be improving from there based on your visibility today. And then the new thing is only logic and the push back to put out you mentioned about logic. And then on the back of that, my question would be how much confidence do you have in Q4 numbers is also baking in low points in logic, which means that we would have gone through in just a couple of quarters a pull back in memory and a pull back in logic and with therefore limited reason so they’re negative surprise down the line?
Gary Dickerson: A couple of comments, on the memory side, everything that is out in the market today from an information standpoint it was reflected in our guide and that's playing out as we thought, so there's no incremental news or information. And the delta between what we thought -- how we thought Q4 was going to profile three months ago versus what we’re guiding to today is a foundry driven dynamic. So you used the word logic we differentiate between logic and foundry. And so I just want to be clear that our view is coming out of the foundry market. And it was versus our expectations on how Q4 was going to profile. So that is the big delta between what we thought three months ago. And as we roll the clock forward, the spending in foundry today is being driven by very long lead time items, which we see as a lead indicator for our business where the lead times are much shorter as capacity comes online to meet customer demand. So I think the set up around 2019 for us as a result of that in the foundry market looks good.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen. Your line is now open.
Steven Chin: Gary, earlier you mentioned some comments on the NAND market specifically what you’re seeing in terms of the demand growth of about 40% and supply growth little bit more in that. Just wondering if you could give us a little more color on how you see the NAND WFE profile going to the back end of this year and maybe into 2019, just based on some of those comments. And I guess the implication would be there might be some pricing pressure in the NAND market of the demand continues to play out. And if so would you expect that NAND WFE to see some slow down towards the back end of the year, because of pricing or do you think investments in upgrades to the 96 layers or above if that will continue and hence continue to keep NAND WFE strong?
Dan Durn: So I guess here is the comment that I would make on the NAND market. We signaled a quarter ago that we’re going to see some back half weakness I think that’s playing out as we expected. In Gary prepared comments, he talked about the NAND market being down year-over-year versus 2017, we see that playing out. And as we look at the health of the market, if we take a step back and just look at the macro drivers driving semiconductor demand today, those macro drivers are impact and playing out as expected, things like artificial intelligence and data economy are going to drive structurally larger semiconductor industry demand as the demand for those devices to fuel those trends increases over time. As we take a look at customer profitability, it's better today than it's ever been. And they're investing a lot of money. But as a percentage of their profitability, it’s down substantially since 2012. In the memory market over that time period, CapEx as a percentage of the EBITDA is down 40%. And the customers are doing a better job of modulating supply and making demand lead investments. There will always be adjustments from a supply-demand standpoint to keep those markets in balance. And I think our customers have done a good job to strike the right balance in the environment that we’re in. And as we look forward into 2019, I’ll come back to an earlier comment on one of the earlier questions. We see a healthy dynamic across all four device types into 2019.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Guys similar to your U.S. peers, you’re calling your October quarter as the bottom, a little bit different than U.S. peers. They’re a little bit emphatic about growth into their December quarter your January quarter. And I am just curious is that a function of your being over-indexed for foundry or not as indexed to 5 nano-meter on the process equipment side, i.e. if you were to look at your domestic peers and compare the apples-to apples-business. Would you be more confident that your January semi equipment business would be up sequentially?
Dan Durn: So I think there is a couple things that play, John. And thanks for question. The first thing I would say is it's hard for me to know exactly what the assumptions were in each of the competitors’ and peers’ forecasts. So it's hard to make a direct comparison of what we see differently than others. What I would say is as our guide reflects everything we see our footprint is broader than our peers. We’re exposed to more of those end markets and device types. And the guidance we have reflects our view of the world and the conversations we’re having with our customers. From a foundry specific standpoint, we emphasize the fact that spending on the leading edge today is prioritizing some very long lead time items for capacity that will come online in the next year, 18 months which is a nice set up for shorter lead time tools, which creates a nice opportunity for us going into 2019. So it’s hard to be very specific on a comparative basis of how we’re profiling differently than others. All we can try to do is be transparent with what we see developing in the market and how our conversations with customers are profiling.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Can you guys just help us understand the dynamics around the foundry push-outs? If I look at SEMICON coverage universe, some of the big complex as we see guys, Qualcomm, AMD, Xilinx, Qualcomm, so on, 7 nanometer tape out looks actually quite significant that’s going to start to around beginning of next year. So if you could just help us understand the rationale for your views on what you think in terms of why the push-out of investments here into second half of this year? And maybe just also address the breath of the foundry push-out. Is it primarily one customer or is it multiple customers?
Dan Durn: As we take a look at the foundry segment, what we can reflect in our guide is what gets communicated from our customer base. And the customers have done a very good job in the foundry space, managing a supply statement commensurate with where they see demand coming from. As you now, tape outs come and capacity gets put in place. And so there's a pretty close synchronization in that market as the business materialize, capacity gets deployed to meet that demand statement. So we feel pretty good that what's in the market today from a capacity standpoint is able to absorb the demand that's coming into the foundry space. The second part of your question, over the past month, we’ve been reading about public comments on adjustment in the foundry spending reflects conversations we have with the customer base. You’re now seeing that reflected in our guidance going forward. The adjustment we’re seeing is primarily from what you've been reading about, but not exclusively one customer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.
Romit Shah: I guess two part from me, and I mean you made the comment, Gary, in your prepared remarks that the business is seeing less fluctuations. But you three months ago said that July was going to be the bottom and October would grow and now you’re guiding October revenues down about 10%. So how was it that the business is more aligned and less cyclical than what we’ve seen [Technical Difficulty]? And I guess as a second part to that DRAM spending, I understand the strong, but all indications are that DRAM price is going to be down in Q4. So what gives you confidence that this isn’t the next -- DRAM is not the next year to drop? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: When we contemplated our July guidance and how October was going to profile, it was conditioned on set of conversations and a set of knowledge that was in the market. Subsequent to that, there was an adjustment in spend profiles in the foundry space, so new information became available and our guidance reflects all of the information that's out there today. When I take a step back and we talk about resilience and we talk about less cyclicality, let's talk about the overall markets and then specifically apply it to Applied Materials. 2017 in the WFE space was an all-time record year. 2018 is going to be up over ‘17 with strength across all device types in an environment where we’re talking about re-profiling of both, memory and foundry spend. And so I think that's a pretty strong statement from an end market standpoint that the industry is evolving in ways that I think will accrue benefits to us going forward. When we take a step back and look at Applied specifically in an environment characterized by those same pressures re-profiling memory and foundry spend. We talked about EPS in my prepared comments a single quarter is now larger than what this company used to do in a full year just a short time ago. And I think that's a pretty strong statement that our business is more resilient and less cyclical than we've seen in the past. So we feel pretty good about that context in those statements. And Romit, what was the second part of your question?
Romit Shah: I was curious about DRAM, DRAM spending has been strong, but it looks like in Q4 DRAM prices could be down. And given that we saw earlier in the year weakness in NAND that preclude a decline in NAND spend. And I guess I'm [Technical Difficulty]…
Gary Dickerson: So I guess the best way I would address that Romit is there can always be changes in markets what we’re giving perspective on today is what we're seeing in the market. The supply demand balance has been reasonably [Technical Difficulty] from DRAM standpoint, it’s led to pricing stability. It's something the customers monitor very granularly. And they’ve been very disciplined, from an investment standpoint, making demand led investments. Taking a step back [Technical Difficulty] I think the longer term demand drivers around silicon, DRAM, NAND, logic, foundry, all device types, are still there. And so if there are short-term disruptions, I don't think it takes -- it changes our long-term view of how these markets evolve. And so we view the market still is healthy.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri of UBS Securities. Your line is now open.
Tim Arcuri: Dan, I wanted to ask a question about SSG share. So even if I assume like $51 billion this year, which it sounds like it’s probably going to be at least that, if not higher. Other guys are saying $52 billion or $53 billion. It still looks like based upon your guidance for the fiscal Q1 that you’re still going to lose a little bit of WFE share this year after losing a little bit last year as well. Now maybe that $51 billion number is too high or something. But even if I look at the 2020 model, your comments on that, you said SSG is going to still be about $11.6 billion or higher, which is in line with your model. But your old model was at $45 billion WFE. And now it seems like you're saying that $50 billion is the new normal. So it seems like the share assumption has come down a bit, so I’m wondering what’s your read into all that? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: So I think -- so last year, the share wasn’t down. I think if you go back to the previous six years, the share was up or flat, mostly up in all of the previous six years. So if you take an overall look at the Company over the last few years. One of the big things that we've driven is a much better balance across all device types. So if go back to 2013, we had only greater than 20% share in foundry, less than 15% share in NAND, DRAM and logic. Since 2013, we’ve grown the memory revenue 5x and 7% share growth and almost 2x growth in revenue and logic. So again, tremendous balance across all the device types versus really just being more foundry focus. And what I would say going forward that certain Dan reiterated that we would exceed the model for 2020. And if I look at the Company, how we’re positioned, we’re in a great position for next technology nodes, a very strong pipeline of new products across many markets and compelling integrated material solutions, and we talked about some of that over the last two months. And in the new products in material solutions we’ll introduce some significant new capabilities in the next 12 months and beyond. And also, if you look from a macro perspective, I was the speaker at the AI Design Forum and the DARPA conferences and some of the themes that came out of that were around AI, Big Data being a major opportunity, at the same time, Moore's Law's challenged. So at those conferences and you see many people talking about the future being about materials, new structures, 3D driving future innovation, enabling AI, Big Data, power performance area and cost, future logic, memory, patterning packaging. And at one of those conferences, I gave examples of new capabilities, including three orders of magnitude improvement leakage current that provides lower power performance. And there’s again a very large value in time-to-market. So when you think about going from materials to systems, there's tremendous value in accelerating that whole process going from materials, to single process test, to integrated materials, to structures, to devices, to packages, to systems. And I really deeply feel Applied’s never been in a better position to use our breath to enable these new capabilities. So bottom line from a position standpoint, we've never been in a better position. We have a very strong pipeline of new products integrated material solutions, and Applied really to the foundation of accelerating these AI, Big Data industry inflections.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Gary, I was hoping to get an update on how you view your near and medium term opportunity in China. Obviously, there's lots going on from a political/trade perspective. I think some of your customers are making some progress on the technology front. I think one of your NAND customers had a pretty big presence at the Flash Memory Summit last week. So just curious what you're seeing today, and if you've seen any pull-ins from your customers in China? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Our current forecast for China is in line with our prior assumptions. 2018 is going to be a great year for Applied. We’ll grow faster than the market. And based on our mitigation plans, we don't see any meaningful impact from tariffs that have imposed that I know people are wondering about. So overall, strong position in China. Regarding the geopolitical situation, certainly, we believe in fair trade and that successful resolution -- the current situation is important the overall ecosystem. And we believe that’s the likely ultimate outcome. Relative to Applied, we will continue to monitor the impact of any future developments to Applied supply chain customers and take any actions that are needed to mitigate impact to Applied and our customers. Relative to technology positions, I think nothing has really changed versus what we thought before. China will continue to incrementally invest. This year, the domestic business is more heavily weighted to foundry logic than memory. Similar to 2017 was more foundry logic. 2019 we see more weighted towards foundry logic. But China will definitely continue to incrementally invest. We don't see any hockey-stick relative to future investment. And we still believe it’s going to take a long time for their technology to mature to get anywhere close to leading-edge. But again, incrementally, we still see China as a very positive market for Applied.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Gary, in the past Analyst Days, which by the way we have an update on when you think this year the Analyst Day you will be where and when. You’ve talked about capital intensity trends, particularly for the NAND industry and how that’s positively impacted Applied Materials as the industry moves to 96 layers and above. Can you give us a little bit of an update on Applied’s position both in its core edge and disposition businesses but also in other areas like CMP and process control where you gained share in the past and you’re looking to gain more share?
Gary Dickerson: So I think it was 2000 -- maybe it was 2013, we talked about the 2D -- the 3D NAND inflection and the business moving from LIFO intensive to edge and deposition intensive. And as I talked about earlier, we’ve grown our memory revenue from 2013 about 5x, we’ve increased share 7%. We’re optimistic that the scaling is going to continue for 3D NAND. And we have some really tremendously enabling capabilities, the edge business for us is continuing to grow. Our conductor edge share is in a leadership position. We have new capabilities that we’re bringing to market in NAND. So we're very optimistic on edge. We’re optimistic in terms of deposition. CMP steps are growing in 3D NAND. So again overall I’m very optimistic about the market and our position.
Michael Sullivan: And guys maybe I'll give an update on the Analyst Day. So we're looking at New York probably for the next one. I’ve got a venue that’s on hold. What we haven’t finalized is the date. And I’ve really got two choices that we’re thinking about. One is we squeeze it in before the end of the year. What I’m thinking about is if we do that, we’re going to give a long term outlook that sounds a lot like what we did at SEMICON and AI Design Forum. The other choice is to save the meeting for next year. If we do that, what we’ll be able to do is give you some updates on some of the products that we've been alluding to and also some of the initiatives that Gary has been describing, which might be a benefit. So if you ask me from where we sit here, I am leaning to next year and what we need to do is make a final determination and then send you a calendar notice. So I promise to do that, Patrick. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joseph Moore: I have a question on the three-year outlook. We expect that the WFE number for FY’20 was $45 billion it’s not $50 billion. What’s the rationale for the change, what’s changed since you gave the $45 billion number? And then can you talk a little bit about you maintaining the gross margin guidance with some mix shift with display lower and services higher. What’s the impact of that mix shift? Thank you.
Dan Durn: As we take a step back and just look at where we sit relative to what was communicated at the last Analyst Day just in terms of what the new normal is. 2017 was high 40s from a WFE standpoint. We talk about ’18 and ‘19 combined exceeding $100 billion. And so I think there is visibility on three nice proof points that get us to an industry that's larger than what was originally contemplated when we first went out with our long-term model. So we feel pretty good about $50 billion being the new norm in the industry going forward. And the second part of your question?
Joseph Moore: Just the gross margin impact of mix shift with the services, foundry and display…
Dan Durn: So the gross margins of our business, while we don't disclose what they are, in order our semi business, our display business and our service business. And you rightfully point out as display is falling short of the target that was originally contemplated by 2020. That shortfall gets made up by our services business, creates a natural headwind in the business. And the management team is working hard on a number of fronts to drive gross margins in our execution to deliver on our shareholder commitments. And so it's just a lot of hard work that underpins the journey we've been on. And the Company has made great progress on this in the last four or five years where our gross margins are up 500 basis points. So we feel good about the journey ahead.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from West Twigg of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
West Twigg: I wanted to ask about cobalt adoption. You’ve detailed it a couple of months ago, just wondering if you could comment on the traction you’re seeing. And are customers successfully integrating it, or do you see any yield risk. And I think you said there was around $500 million opportunity of 7-nanometer. How far into that opportunity do you think you will get in 2019 based on the current customer activity?
Dan Durn: So we see cobalt continuing to be adopted over the next three, four years. Just for reference, one layer of cobalt adds about $70 million incremental business. So from where we’re at right now, we continue to see adoption. It’s probably in $250 million $300 million range over the next few years in terms of incremental business.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Wes. Operator, I think we got time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Edwin Mok: On the prepared remarks, you guys talk about patterning, you guys have growing a patterning business and potentially adding $1 billion over the next five years. And you when we talk to investors, some of them are worried that you might actually reduce the patterning TAM. So is this possible, can you guys slide maybe some examples of why you think your patterning business didn’t grow? Is it driven by share gain, new process, new architecture, et cetera?
Dan Durn: We have a number of strong products in the patterning market, the Sym3 and Selectra, the CMP business is also growing as more patterning steps are adopted. We have new deposition capabilities. So our overall market as you talked about grew a billion dollars over the last two years. We have a lot of confidence and line of sight to additional billion dollars over the next two years. So if you look at the market overall, about 50% is memory. Certainly, our share is growing a significant amount. You have trailing geometries about 25%. 25% is leading foundry and logic. And we see in the foundry logic significant traction. If we look at our share of patterning in 5-nanometer and our overall TAM 5 versus 7 goes up something like 25%, our positional share in 5 will also go up, especially in patterning. So as multi-patterning gets further adopted and EUV steps are adopted, all of that is incrementally positive for Applied. EUV steps are replacing positions that Applied really isn’t present today; so both of those areas, the growth in EUV, the growth in multi-patterning are positive for applied. And the other thing I would say relative to patterning. There are really to major areas of focus; one is shrinking features; but the other one is placing features in the right position. And if you look from an overall industry perspective, this pattern placement or alignment is a big challenge for customers. So we have a very good position as some of these new processes are adopted and certainly we have good line of sight to the future technology node. So for applied EUV is positive, our positions are positive and we have good line of sight to that additional growth.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Edwin for your question. And Dan, would you like to add anything in closing.
Dan Durn: Thanks Mike. To me it comes down to three things. First, our markets and in particular company what we continue to see going forward, our business is going to be sustainably larger. It's more diverse, less volatile, less cyclical than it's been in the past. Couple of proof points we look at. In my intro talked about how we can now do the same level of earnings in a single quarter that we used to do in a full year a short while ago. Something else to think about; even with the adjustments and spend that our customers have made this year, the lowest quarter of EPS in 2018 will be higher than any quarter in 2017, which was an all-time record for the Company; second, 2019, we see continued strength. The more we talk to both customers and others in the tech ecosystem, the more we believe. We’re on the beginning of a powerful new wave. Applied Materials is on the critical path. Those trends depend on what Applied does best. Third, 2020 financial model, on track to exceed the targets we have out there. What it also says behind the scenes, we’re building a pipeline, strong pipeline of new products, new innovations, new opportunities that set us up extremely well in the years beyond. As Gary said, we’ve never been better positioned as a company than we are today. Lastly, Citigroup conference is coming up in a few weeks. Look forward to seeing many of you there. And just let us know if you have any questions. We want to be helpful we’re here to help, just let us know.  With that, Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, great. Thanks Dan. And we’d like to thank everybody for joining us. A replay of this call is going to be available on our Web site by 5 PM to Pacific Time today. And thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied’s most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management’s estimates, projections and assumptions as of May 17, 2018, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them. Today’s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today’s earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. On Tuesday morning, July 10th, Applied Materials is sponsoring technology briefing during SEMICON West in San Francisco. Please save the date and stay tuned for additional details. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. Applied’s performance in the second fiscal quarter was another all-time record for the Company, with revenue up 29% from the same period last year. I’d like to congratulate and thank our employees around the world for these outstanding results. Across the Company, we have tremendous momentum. Applied has broad exposure to major technology trends and is playing a larger more valuable role in the electronics ecosystem. All three of our major business segments semiconductor display and service remain on track to deliver strong double-digit growth in fiscal 2018. In today’s call, I’ll provide our perspective on how the major trends driving our markets are evolving. I’ll outline our strategy and how we are translating our broad portfolio of products and capabilities into sustainable growth for Applied, then Dan will provide more details about our financial performance and outlook. During this past quarter, there have been some puts and takes in our customers’ near-term investment plans. Smartphone sales have been below expectations, particularly for high-end models, and in response, both semiconductor and display suppliers have made adjustments to their capacity planning. We view the current investment levels as rational and disciplined, particularly in the memory market. We therefore believe a healthy balance of supply and demand will be maintained. Smartphones remain a key long-term driver of both technology and capacity. In many ways, smartphones are the ultimate edge device. And as handset makers add more functions and features to their products, we see the content per box continuing to grow. For example, recent forecast from our customers indicate that average yearly growth in mobility content over the next three years will be around 35% for NAND and 20% for DRAM. In contrast to the weakness in smartphone unit sales we have seen in the first part of this year, there is evidence that emerging drivers of industry growth are picking up pace. The Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence will disrupt and transform virtually every industry and area of the economy over the next decade. While we are only at the very beginning of the buildout of the AI, big data era, we are already starting to see the positive impact on our markets. In just the past six months, cloud service providers have increased their capital investments significantly. Looking at the financial reports from the top seven cloud service providers, we see their CapEx up around 40% this year versus previous expectations of about 30%. Also, data center real estate investments made by those companies in 2017 were up more than 250% compared to 2016, which we view as a positive leading indicator of growth. Data centers are already becoming a much larger consumer of silicon. For example, the market for server DRAM is currently growing about 75% faster than mobile DRAM, which means it could become the largest segment of the DRAM market in the next three to five years. In addition, the architecture war for AI leadership is heating up with a steady stream of new, high-performance computing hardware coming to market. At both the server and chip level, we see a major shift from general-purpose computing to new hardware architectures that are customized for specific computing tasks or workloads. This significant technology inflection is fueling new investments in hardware design and new silicon devices, which in turn are driving significant innovation throughout the ecosystem. I’ll now translate these end market trends into an outlook for Applied’s served markets. As I mentioned, we are seeing extremely disciplined investment by our memory customers, which we believe bodes well for healthy market dynamics. In line with our previous forecast, NAND bit demand is expected to grow at about 40% this year. While we have reduced our expectations for NAND investments in 2018, we still see spending being similar to last year’s high levels. Our outlook for DRAM investments has strengthened as customers invest in capacity and technology to meet growing demand for high-performance DRAM used in data centers. We expect this year’s combined investments by foundry and logic customers to be similar to 2017, and we anticipate the spending will be split relatively evenly between leading-edge and trailing geometries to serve growing IoT and automotive applications. We also continue to see a steady ramp of spending in China by both multinational and domestic manufacturers, in line with our prior assumptions. Taking all of these factors into account, we maintain our view that combined wafer fab equipment investments in 2018 and 2019 could be around $100 billion. In display, investments in large substrate Gen 10.5 TV capacity remain strong. Adoption of OLED screens in mobile and the ramp of manufacturing capacity are slower than previously expected, primarily due to weakness in high-end smartphone sales. We view OLED as a compelling technology and the leading handset makers are committed to making the transition over time. Compared to LCD, OLED offers significant performance and power advantages, as well as lower cost and high volume production. In addition, next generation flexible OLED will enable new form factors such as curved and ultimately foldable screens. Applied Materials’ vision is to make possible the technology shaping the future. And we have aligned our investments, organization and operating systems to realize this vision. In many ways, it is the breadth of our capabilities and product portfolio that sets us apart. We have the broadest exposure to industry trends and our business is well-balanced across a variety of markets and market segments. In addition, as the industry roadmaps become increasingly challenging, material solutions are more critical to deliver the needed improvements in power, performance area and costs for next generation devices. Our ability to address these complex challenges with innovative approaches to materials creation, materials removal and materials modification is becoming increasingly valuable. We also have unique technologies like e-beam to measure, understand and inspect new materials and structures. We are using our breadth to help customers accelerate their roadmaps. Shortening the time it takes to bring new devices to market is incredibly valuable, resulting in strong customer pool for material solutions that go beyond traditional unit process tools. We are excited about our pipeline and will share more insights into these capabilities later this year. In semiconductor, the strength of our technology portfolio has enabled us to outperform the market for six consecutive years. Based on our expanding opportunities and the traction of our new products, we expect to grow faster than the market again this year. With our R&D priorities aligned to our customers’ evolving requirements, it is clear that advancing the industry roadmap is going to require a combination of new device architectures including 3D structures and advanced packaging, new materials, and new ways to shrink chip geometries that address both resolution and placement. There is significant innovation taking place in all three of these areas, and that creates great opportunities for Applied. Even in shrink, our opportunity is growing, regardless of the pace of EUV lithography adoption. The reasons for this include self aligned multi-patterning techniques SADP and SAQP which are needed in conjunction with EUV lithography to drive the resolution roadmap and new materials enabled patterning approaches which are being developed as the primary solution for placement errors. Placement errors or the vertical alignment between the layers of a device can have a significant impact on device performance and reliability. Beyond equipment, we continue to invest in new service products and organizational capabilities to create value for our customers. Our service business delivered all-time record performance this quarter with revenues up 30% relative to the same period last year. Over the longer term, we are confident that we can sustain annual service growth of at least 15%, driven by a growing installed base, a larger portion of those tools under long-term service agreements, and new service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize operating costs. In display, since 2012, we’ve grown revenues at an average rate of 25% per year and in 2018, we remain on track to grow by more than 30%. Based on recent revisions to timing of customers’ OLED plans, our early view of 2019 is that our revenue will be lower than this year, although still nicely up from 2017. Overall, we maintain a positive outlook for the business as unique, long-term growth driver for Applied. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I’ll quickly summarize. While we’ve seen some recent changes in customers’ near-term investment plans, our markets remain strong and healthy with long-term demand drivers firmly in place. We maintain our view that wafer fab equipment spending for 2018 and 2019 combined could be $100 billion. Applied is outperforming our served markets. And in fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver strong double-digit growth in semi, display and services. As we look ahead, we see emerging technology trends that play to Applied’s breadth. And we are excited about our expanding role, bringing new devices to market. Now, Dan will give his perspective on our performance and outlook.
Dan Durn: Thanks, Gary. In Q2, Applied set new performance records across a variety of operating and financial metrics. Our manufacturing and operations teams shipped a record number of 300 millimeter systems while hitting key goals for quality and on-time delivery. Company revenue was an all-time high, up 29% year-over-year. Our semi equipment and services businesses both set revenue records, and we exceeded our outlook in display. We maintained strong gross margins even as our service, and display businesses outgrew semi. We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 40% year-over-year to $1.38 billion a new record. And we continue to become more efficient. We reduced our non-GAAP OpEx to sales ratio to 16.6%, the lowest in our history. And we did this by growing, not cutting. In fact, we are investing more in R&D than at any time in our history, to support our customers with new materials and innovative solutions. This makes Applied a uniquely valuable partner in driving the roadmap for continued high performance, low power and low cost. We will continue to invest with discipline and be laser focused on improving our execution and financial results. I believe Applied’s strong performance is also attributable to better industry dynamics. We see growing evidence that our markets are larger and less variable. We expect strong semiconductor equipment spending in 2018 and 2019, despite weakness in the high-end segment of the smartphone market, which is still the single biggest driver of semiconductor revenue. In the past, weakness within the largest end-product category might have caused a significant correction, particularly in memory. But Applied’s results and outlook remains strong. This outcome reinforces our belief in three positive factors. One, there are more demand drivers than ever before. Today the PC market is growing. Smartphones comes with wide range of price points to suite more consumers around the world and the new data economy is just beginning to take shape. Gary mentioned the strength in data center leading indicator for us. I personally believe, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence are business-critical, not consumer discretionary. Second capital intensity is higher. And third, our customers are healthy and adding capacity in a disciplined manner to meet demand where it is needed the most. In fact, while high-end smartphone units were weaker than expected, lower NAND pricing is creating additional demand for solid-state drives. In a world where data grows exponentially, it will take many years for our customers to convert the storage market from magnetic technology to semiconductors. In this environment, Applied’s breadth is a unique advantage. In semiconductor systems, Gary described how we are combining our technologies to help customers in new ways. You’ll see more evidence of this in the months ahead. Applied is strong across memory, foundry and logic. And we are growing in memory where our leadership products are being used to improve performance and reduce power consumption. Technologies like high-k/metal gate were pioneered in the logic market and are now being adopted in DRAM. Many of our new multi-patterning wins are also in DRAM. Today, we are also growing our semi business beyond the opportunity set of the most advanced logic and memory nodes. Our 200 millimeter systems and our trailing node 300 millimeter systems served many hundreds of end customers in diverse industries such as automotive and industrial. Our 200 millimeter systems revenue should be up over 20% this year. In fact, we are now building brand-new systems to keep up with demand for the billions of sensors and other low-cost devices needed in the Internet of Things, advanced automotive applications, and Industry 4.0. These systems shipments are also helping us diversifying service, which gives us growth, consistent revenue and excellent cash flow. And Applied has a unique opportunity in display. As Gary discussed, while the transition to OLED smartphones will take some additional time, our overall display business is diverse and remains very strong. As a company, we’ve never had such a broad set of growth drivers, and we have more in the pipeline. As a result, our fiscal year revenue could be up by more than 20% in 2018 and our non-GAAP EPS could be up over 40%. We are well on track to our goal of achieving over $5 in non-GAAP EPS by 2020. In short, we have strong conviction in our markets, our strategy, our technology pipeline, and our opportunity to deliver growth over the long run, even when equity markets are volatile in the short run. Consistent with our convection, we used $2.5 billion during the quarter to repurchase 44 million shares of our stock or about 4% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the period. Over the past four quarters, our buybacks were equivalent to 7% of the shares outstanding. At the same time, we’ve maintained a very strong balance sheet. We plan to increase our CapEx by about $400 million this year. The majority of the increase will be used to expand our R&D capabilities and manufacturing capacity. Now, a comment on our financial execution in Q2. We delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in both revenue and non-GAAP EPS, which was $1.22 or $1.19 minus the benefit of a lower tax rate share count. On a year-over-year non-GAAP basis, we increased gross margin by 40 basis points, increased operating margin by 240 basis points, and grew EPS by 54%. Turning to the segments. We delivered record revenue and operating profit in both semi equipment and services. We grew semi equipment revenue by 25% year-over-year. Services revenue was up 30% and above our expectation, driven by strong spare parts demand along with new long-term service agreements and renewals. In display, we grew revenue by 53% year-over-year and grew non-GAAP operating margin by 620 basis points year-over-year. We expect display revenue to be higher in our second half. Thanks to our balanced exposure to inflections in both the TV and mobile markets. Now, I’ll share our business outlook for Q3 as compared to the same period last year. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $4.33 billion to $4.53 billion. The midpoint would be up by about 18% year-over-year. We expect semiconductor systems revenue to grow about 7%. Our services revenue should increase by about 23%. Our display revenue should grow by about 75%. Our non-GAAP gross margins should be around 46.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $770 million, plus or minus $10 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.17, plus or minus $0.04. The midpoint of the range is up nearly 36%. Finally, I will add some additional color to help you with your models for the full fiscal year in which overall company revenue could be up around 22%. The following four metrics are likely to be approximately flat sequentially from Q3 to Q4, services revenue, display revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP OpEx; and our semiconductor systems revenue is likely to be up sequentially in Q4. And now, I’ll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. Now, to help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please poll the operator and we’ll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let’s please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, question for me is considering the weakness you are seeing in the high-end smartphone side, as your outlook for total WFE low double-digit growth in calendar ‘18 changed, could you discuss that? And then, how should we think about the $100 billion combined WFE outlook that you provided? Is that guide or just more reflective of your view that spending will remain sustainable -- strong into next year?
Dan Durn: I think, it’s a reflection of our conviction in our end markets and sustainably strong. We feel really good about the end markets, like Gary said $100 billion in 2018 and 2019, and we are seeing strength across all device types. The markets are more balanced today than they’ve probably ever been. 2017, was a very strong year. 2018 will be up over ‘17, and we see the fundamentals into ‘19 being strong. So, we still feel good about the markets, the performance and the outlook into 2019.
Operator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citigroup.
Atif Malik: Can you talk about the mix of LCD versus OLED displays in the reported quarter? And with expectations for display being down in 2019, are you expecting the TV market to be down, or is it more OLED?
Gary Dickerson: So, let me give some color on display overall. Display is a really good adjacent market for Applied. We averaged 25% growth, annual growth between 2012 and 2017. And we are still on track to greater than 30% revenue growth in 2018. Based on the customer plans our view of 2019 is for revenue to be down around 15% or 20%. When we look at mobile and TV, in ‘18, we see investment balance between mobile and TV; ‘19, more weighted towards TV. And in TV, the adoption of larger screens is driving the market. If you look at a Gen 10.5 factory versus a Gen 8.5 factory, you can produce eight 65-inch televisions versus three 65-inch televisions. So, it’s really compelling value proposition there. We are still tracking 13 Gen 10.5 projects. There is a long lead time for these factories. And customers are still on track with these investments. In OLED it is slower than we previously expected. We are still tracking 23 fabs that timing has extended out from around 2021 to 2023. But the transitioned OLED display is still compelling and leading handset makers are still committed to make the transition. If you look at rigid OLED, you have better performance, better form factor, lower cost, entitlement, and high volume manufacturing, and the ability to go to flexible OLED for curved and eventually foldable screens. So, we have had great performance in growth in display over the last few years. With future technology inflections, our pipeline of new capabilities, we continue to see display as a really good growth opportunity for Applied.
Operator: Our next question is from Pierre Ferragu with Newstreet Research.
Pierre Ferragu: Gary, you mentioned in your prepared remarks how the industry has become disciplined in the way it’s managing its investments. And I think maybe you could elaborate on that and tell us what happened in the first quarter of the year. So, demand in smartphones came in weaker than expected. We are like in a weak smartphone environment; that’s fairly new. So, my question is this new discipline, does that mean that your clients have been able to adapt their plans very rapidly and adapted plans already? Although that actually means that the unit growth of smartphone as a driver for the industry as a whole is now so small and lost into other drivers like content increase and other markets like data center, and this is that actually -- that’s not a moving part that really affects investment plans in today’s world?
Dan Durn: So, if we take a look at the memory markets as an illustration of the point around discipline, we take a look at the demand. End-market demand is strong. The macro drivers, we keep talking about artificial intelligence, data economy or real, they are playing out and it’s driving demand for silicon. We see that demand in the memory market. Customers are incredibly healthy. They are investing a lot, but they’re also making a lot. In fact, WFE as a percent of EBITDA is down 50% from 2012 to today. And the environment is characterized by demand led investments. The market is showing incredible discipline. In DRAM 2017, supply bit growth was about 20%. Demand bit growth in 2017 was slightly more than that. In 2018, we expect supply and demand in the DRAM market to be balanced at about 20% growth each. In NAND, it’s a similar story. In 2017, supply bit growth was about 30% to 35%. In 2017, demand bit growth was about 35% to 40%. In 2018, again, we see a balanced market from a supply-demand perspective, both at about 40%. When we look at what’s happening in China, we are seeing modest and disciplined growth in China. China is emerging as a spender, their strategic intent is clear and the financial resources they have are clear. And based on our dialogue, we think the expectations with those customers are realistic. They are being pragmatic. Capacity additions to date are modest. And when we take all of this into account, we have confidence in this region in the long run. So, across multiple markets, multiple geographies, we are seeing a very disciplined environment play out. And as we take a step back from that environment, 2017 was a great year in WFE. 2018 will be up over 2017. As Gary said, could be $100 billion between ‘18 and ‘19. So, we are seeing strength across all device types, customers are healthy, and they are acting in a disciplined manner.
Operator: Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.
Harlan Sur: Thanks for the commentary on memory. So, you see a balanced supply demand outlook for DRAM. I think, industry capacity entering this year was about 1.1 million wafer starts per month but as you guys know, the DRAM suppliers are losing effective capacity like every time they do a technology migration I think something to the tune of like 15% capacity loss. And then bit per wafer is also going down every time they do technology migration. So, given what you’re seeing, what you think we end the year as it relates to total DRAM capacity? Thank you. 
Dan Durn: Thanks for the question. If we go back to 2016, it was 1.1 million wafer starts per month and probably a handful of years before that it was 1.1 million wafer starts per month. In 2017, because of exactly the dynamic you talked about, which is we’re getting big growth out of shrinks and the shrinks are happening at a less frequent interval, we saw more capacity adds in the DRAM market. So, it rounded to 1.2 million wafer starts per month, exiting 2017. I think, it’s too early to call where we end up in 2018, but we definitely see customers struggling to drive bit growth from shrinks alone, factory output when you shrink because the process is more complex, goes down and Greenfield adds are being just added to keep the supply demand and balance driving about a 20% bit supply growth in line with bit demand growth. So, too early to call it but it still looks like a healthy market, acting with discipline.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. One thing I would like to add is that in DRAM, we’re going to see very strong growth in revenue in 2018, much faster than what we project for the market. The devices are changing to become more logic like in the periphery, similar to 28-nanometer foundry steps. We’re also gaining and patterning the wins where we never had positions. So, especially in DRAM, we see very strong growth for Applied in 2018 and beyond.
Operator: Thank you our next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.
Romit Shah: If I heard you correctly, Dan, you guys are reiterating your 2020 target, but at the same time you’re lowering your outlook for display. I mean, relative to what the street is forecasting, it looks like it’s about $600 million swing in display revenue guidance relative to forecast. So, can you help us reconcile reiteration of that 2020 target versus the lower guidance for display? Thank you. 
Dan Durn: So, look, the business is performing extremely well. Q2 was a record quarter; 2018 is going to be a record year for the company. We’ve got more pipeline opportunities, new products that are to be introduced, we’re going to be announcing them in the near term. The business is performing well and we’re driving good performance. We are well on our track to hitting over $5 of EPS by 2020. How that profiles across the business? We’re not going to update the long-term model on this call; we’ll do that at our analyst day later this fall. But at the core is a business that’s performing well with a lot of conviction around hitting that long-term target of $5 of EPS, over $5 of EPS by 2020.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: I wanted to follow up on this $100 billion over this year and in next year. And it sounded that base line for this year that you guys are talking about is like in the low 50s because you’re saying up double digits off of like a $47 billion number. So, that would imply that it’s down like 5 billion to $6 billion next year. I know that that’s not guidance and you could just easily probably raise it to 105 or something like that. But I’m a little surprised that the number is not a bit higher because of what’s happening in China. So, I guess my question is, A, like, what’s going to decline next year if that’s what you’re trying to imply? And B, can you talk about the ramp in China, now we are shipping into three projects in China? And Gary, how you think that those ramp through this year and next year?
Dan Durn: So, a couple of things. First of all, thanks for the question. I don’t think that we are providing specific guide on 2018 and 2019. It’s an indication of strength and follow through. And at the core of that, we feel really good about the end markets. Like Gary said, $100 billion ‘18 and ‘19, we see strengths across all device types. It’s too early to tell today exactly how 2018 profiles first half, second half, full year and how 2019 profiles. But, we’ve got a lot of convection and confidence heading into 2019. There is a number of reasons at the core of it. We are talking about macro trends, they are real, they are having a real impact. Demand for silicon is up. Second, capital intensity is up across the board, and that’s all device types. Markets are balanced. We are seeing strength across all four device types. We take a step back, NAND has gotten a lot of publicity of late. When we end 2018, we are going to see something very similar in the NAND market to 2017, which was an all-time high, taking a step back from the near-term noise. This is an incredibly strong market. Customers, again, for customers continue to be healthy; they are profitable; they are behaving in a disciplined manner. And again, we are seeing the right kind of signals out of China that indicate long-term stability health and being a meaningful driver of growth going forward. So, too early to call exactly how it profiles, but we’ve got a lot of strength and conviction about how the outlook and fundamentals look into 2018.
Gary Dickerson: Tim, I can give maybe a little bit more color also on China. So, 2018 is going to be a great year for Applied in China. We have very strong position in semi, service, display, and we anticipate that we are going to grow faster than the market there. ‘18 is pretty balanced between domestic and global companies from a revenue perspective. Domestic China is higher on foundry logic; global is higher on memory. But overall, we are going to have a great year there in 2018. As Dan said, we believe the investments are rational and will continue. And this is long-term, a great growth opportunity for Applied.
Operator: Our next question is from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad: My first question is regarding the comment that you had on 2018, 2019 WFE at $100 billion plus. If I look at the trends for last several years, ‘14, ‘15 WFE combined was $70 billion; ‘16 ‘17 was 90; ‘18, ‘19, you are saying 100. What do you think like going forward 2021? Should we expect the continued growth in WFE as well and maybe like ‘18 to ‘19 could be down but ‘20 ‘21 should be up from there?
Gary Dickerson: If we go back to 2000 when 300 millimeter wafers were introduced, the industry peaked at a capital intensity or WFE intensity of about 17% of overall industry revenues. And as you work to 300 millimeter systems into the mix, it drove a whole host of efficiencies. That wasn’t more -- just more output per factory; it’s the way the factories were run, factory automation systems. There was a whole host of efficiencies that were driven into the industry. And then, in about maybe 2011, I think it was the industry bottomed at about 7% of WFE intensity. And it’s been on the -- 13% -- 2013 and it’s been on the rise ever since then. But, if we take a look at it today, 2017, it was about 12%. I think, there’s arguments to say that it could go higher based on a lot of complexity we see across the device types and capital intensity increasing. But, if you just keep it at 12% and you think about where the overall semiconductor industry has the potential to grow to, even modest growth rates to 2025 mean that it could be a $650 billion, $700 billion, $750 billion industry. And if you apply your 12% ratio to that aggregate industry revenue, you get to WFE numbers that are significantly north of where we are today. So, we believe in the long-term trends that we’re seeing. We believe that semiconductors are on the critical path of enabling those trends. We believe that the industry is getting more complex and hence more capital-intensive. And we think that we’ve got more opportunities in front of us than we have in the rear view mirror. So we feel good about where this has the potential to go. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I think, historically, you guys have been very good at guiding the services business. I think for the past two quarters, you’ve come in significantly above your guide. I’m just wondering, has anything changed in the business from a fundamental standpoint? And how should we think about sustainability of growth into the back half of the year and into 2019?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Toshiya. I don’t think we’re seeing any fundamental changes in the business. We think that this is a great business for us. We feel good about where it’s headed. It’s a form of less volatile revenue growth. It’s more stable driver of cash flow over time. And the management team that is operating this business in a very disciplined and focused way. We’ve seen growth above our long-term advertise growth rate of compounded 15% per year between now and 2020. At the analyst day, we’ll revise that long-term forecast. But the team is executing well. And growth is really a function of three things in this business. Our installed base, we’ve got the largest installed base in the industry; complexity is going up; service opportunity on a 300 millimeter tool is 4x that of a 200 millimeter tool. So, the opportunity continues to grow over time as we continue to grow and ramp our semiconductor equipment business. And then, the team has done a great job of driving service agreements with our customers. This is about the performance, performance of the machine, output, yield capabilities. It drives better outcomes for our customers, better outcomes for us. And that partnership is reflected in the numbers that we’re driving. So, nothing fundamentally is changed. We’ve seen high utilizations probably driving higher parts uptake than we’ve seen maybe historically at lower levels of utilization throughout the industry. But, it’s just a disciplined focused management team, driving hard at producing good results.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Vivek Arya: Just curious, when I look at your Q3 outlook, it sounds semis would be down sequentially, which is somewhat different than the up sequential sort of guidance that we saw from some of your peers. I know, these things don’t always line up exactly. But, I just wanted to hear your views on why there would be that kind of difference in terms of sequential growth rates in the semiconductor business?
Gary Dickerson: Absolutely. And I agree, this stuff doesn’t line up perfectly, different companies would profile differently. When we take a step back, 2017 was a great year for WFE, 48 billion. In 2018, it’s going to be up over ‘17. We’re going to show strong double-digit growth in each of our respective businesses. First half in ‘18 is strong. And with inventory rebalance that we’re seeing from smartphones, we’re going to see a sequential dip in the Q3. But from our guidance into Q4, you can see that it recovers nicely into Q4. Fundamentals, we’ve talked about it on the call. Fundamentals in the 2019 look good for us. 2018 and 2019, as a combined two-year period are going to be over a $100 billion. It’s going to be a good year. And so, we like the fundamentals and we like where the business is going. But I don’t think there’s too much to read into any one quarter over this period of performance.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.
Krish Sankar: I had a question on display, a two-part question. One is, is it a margin differential between selling to LCD and OLED customers within display? And if display revenue is down 15% next year, if all of the segments are similar, how should op margins look like?
Gary Dickerson: We don’t see any really any difference in the margins between the OLED and TV customers. And then, operating margins, Dan, do you want to cover that one?
Dan Durn: The team is doing a good job driving the operating margins. We’ve talked about the long-term trajectory to the high 20s. And on our analyst day, we will update that long term forecast, but the is doing a good job driving the operating margins.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Gary, maybe specifically for you. You talked about DRAM and the higher capital intensity trends that you’re seeing there for equipment overall; there’s more patterning tests and even new materials being used. Can you maybe go a little more in color in terms of where that’s benefitted your leadership segment as well as where you believe Applied has gained share in the DRAM segment?
Gary Dickerson: So, DRAM, as I said earlier is really going to grow a significant amount for us in 2018. And we could, if you look at the 2013 versus ‘18 have revenue growth around 5X in terms of our DRAM revenue. So, really a significant growth. And as I mentioned before on the call, in the past, we’ve really had strength in one segment, which was foundry that was over 20%. All the other segments were 15% or lower. We’ve increased our share of DRAM, a huge amount. And one thing that’s happening from a device standpoint, they want faster input output to the chip. In the periphery area, you’re starting to see more logic like steps. And as you said, Patrick that benefits all of our products that we normally sell into logic, FE [ph ]PVD implant, thermal, CMP, all of those areas are now seeing demand in DRAM and especially if there’s Greenfield activity taking place that puts us in a great position relative to our overall share of the DRAM spending. We are also making gains in patterning in DRAM. New wins where we never had position really strong gains with Sym3. So, those are the areas where we are seeing the fastest growth.
Operator: And our next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok: My question is actually on the trading at [ph] foundry logic, I think you guys mentioned 200 millimeters, up 20% this year. And I think historically that has not been really a big part of the business that we have heard more and more from equipment companies that that has become a really meaningful part of that business. So, what changed in the trading actually that is driving this growth or become a bigger piece? Customer historically buy old tools or buy older design tool, our customers like adopting the latest and greatest hardware in the trading [ph] as 200 millimeter now?
Dan Durn: So, the changing buying patterns we have seen in customers has really been unfolding over the better part of the decade. If you would go back a decade ago, you would’ve seen 90% of the WFE in the foundry space on the leading edge, 10% on the trailing edge. Over time, that’s evolved to 80-20, 60-40 and this year we see it evolving to 50:50. And I think at the core of that is that more diversified spending is proliferation of edge devices as part of the Internet of Things, requires a different power performance envelope. And you see our estimates, call it for 28 nanometer peak capacity and initially we called peak capacity at 28 nanometers 330,000 wafer starts a month, then it was 400,000, then it was 450,000 and now it’s 500,000 wafer starts a month. So, you can see those peak capacities beginning to expand as edge devices proliferate and you need sensors and intelligence, on-board intelligence in those devices. And so, we think it’s really healthy to see this industry diversify geographically from a technology node perspective. We think it’s healthy from a long-term industry perspective as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho: A few months ago in an investor conference, Dan, you talked about the next downturn could be a WFE going to $40 billion, and that you can achieve EPS better than 2017. Can you walk us through that thought process behind that comment. And what would be the biggest risk to those assumptions?
Dan Durn: Sure. Thanks, Sidney. So, as you know from the prepared comments and the Q&A, certainly $40 billion WFE is not our view, but of course we plan for a wide variety of scenarios. So, if we walk through a scenario, say that’s 40 billion WFE. Let’s say our businesses is diverse. Services is more stable. It’s growing well. And from Gary’s comment, display will be down into 2019. And a 24% market share for lack of a better number, so 24% share in our equipment business, display down, services growing, you get revenue somewhere around $16 billion. And let’s say, we keep OpEx in that difficult environment, we keep OpEx the same as this year, just probably a conservative assumption, but peg it to this year. Operating profit based on that revenue flow-through is something around 26.5%. And so, 2019 EPS in that scenario is nicely higher than where we were in 2017. So, while we model a lot of scenarios, it’s not our current view. But, that’s what a downside scenario could potentially look like.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Wong with Wells Fargo. 
David Wong: Looking at how the percent of your sales into China has been rapidly growing. I think, it was 25% in the most recent quarter. Do you have any view on what your sales growth into China might be in fiscal ‘19 and fiscal ‘20?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks for the question. China is definitely a very strong region for us if we look at our share in semi, display, service, it’s one of the strongest regions. And as I said earlier, ‘18 is going to see significant growth for applied. We do see continued increasing investment in China as we move forward. We don’t have any specific forecast on what that what that will look like, but we have been seeing increasing revenue from China and growth there over two years. We anticipate that to go forward. Now, we don’t expect to see a hockey stick. If you look at the technology needed to participate in the leading-edge, there are still some gaps there. But, one of the things that we are also seeing is that the trailing geometries are growing, Dan just talked about that relative to demand. And certainly, that’s an area where China is making a lot of investments. So, again, we see increased revenue there, increased demand going forward, and overall a great position for Applied.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Dan, I see you had the largest incremental increase in inventory is the largest sequential increase for a number of years. Could you please help us understand what is driving this increase and the mix between finished goods and components?
Dan Durn: Thanks, Mehdi. I think, the inventory increase is a function of two things. We’ve got a growing business. And we think that business is going to continue to grow going forward. But probably most importantly is, as we have consciously brought up our inventory levels in support of our fast-growing services business in the different geographies that we’re experiencing that growth to make sure we get the right kind of customer responsiveness and the right kind of customer satisfaction from a service business that’s becoming increasingly important in and of itself but increasingly important with our customers. And so, it’s a conscious effort to increase service levels in a way that supports that rapid growth.
Gary Dickerson: Operator, I think we have time for two more questions, please.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joe Moore: It sounds like your view of WFE overall hasn’t changed that much but you said NAND a little bit maybe lower than you thought, still up for the year and DRAM a little higher. I guess, what form has that lower NAND taken? Is that sort of existing projects that you have planned -- that you had seen and planned that you see are being deferred? Is it someone just saying we’re going to spend the same amount of money but we’re going to spend it on DRAM instead of NAND or is it just that the -- the year is just playing out a little bit differently than you thought and nothing is sort of identifiable change. So, what’s the scenario that led to NAND being a little bit lower?
Dan Durn: Look, so, I don’t think you can attribute it to any one single factor. And I think it gets back to what we were saying about disciplined behavior in the market with our customers to make sure we’re constantly balancing supply-demand so that customers remain healthy and we can just continue with the demand-led investment environment. And so we think it’s just customers responding in a very rational, disciplined way that reflects the reality of the current market. And look, we’re very close with all of our customers. You hear our views on where we think this is headed in the 2019. So, we feel very, very good about where we sit and actually think the near-term behavior bodes well for the long-term health of the memory market as well as WFE in general.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR.
Craig Ellis: Yes. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all of the insight on the industry dynamics. I did want to however turn to a different issue and focus on a free cash -- or excuse me, a cash flow item. Share buyback was a 2.5 billion a quarter, so about 28% of the authorization that have been expanded three months ago. Dan, I was hoping you could just give us some sense for the way you’re looking at executing on that program as we go forward, whether or it’s going to be more opportunistic or if there’s some calendar or periodic element to the way you would execute on the balance of the program?
Dan Durn: So, you can see the actions we’ve taken. We’ve got a view, our markets are strong. Our position within those respective markets is probably better today than it’s ever been. Company is executing well and we’re generating a lot of cash. We’ve got a long-term track record of returning that cash to shareholders, and that’s going to -- that will continue. In June, we pay our first $0.20 dividend. We repurchased 2.5 billion shares in the quarter, like you point out. And we’re going to continue to be opportunistic in the market. While I won’t commit 2.5 billion every quarter, we’re going to continue to be opportunistic. When we don’t feel like trading price of our stock reflects the intrinsic value of the company, we’ll be in the market over time to return that cash to shareholders. And I think that general framing, that mindset, that outlook just reflects the strong confidence we have, confidence in our industry, in the business and our execution. And we’re going to continue to look at dividend levels periodically over time, and as we grow our business, continue to maintain a strong track record of returning cash to shareholders. But, opportunistic approach going forward, like we’ve always done.
Gary Dickerson: Dan, anything else you want to add before we go ahead and close up the call today?
Dan Durn: Yes, thanks, Mike. So, maybe a couple of quick thoughts that we can wrap up with. I think, I want to reiterate, Q2 is a record quarter. 2018 is going to be another record year for this Company. Company is executing well. We’re driving top line growth. We’re driving margin accretion. We’re driving strong cash flow. And we’re driving more resources into R&D to fuel our future growth. Breadth, breadth is a major positive that sets us apart. In semis we’re hitting new records. We are strong and strong across all device types. We’ve got a growing pipeline. These new products, they are going to deliver high performance and low power to the market. And we are going to see some of those new products here in the very near future. And we are growing beyond semi. While display investments are shifting out in time, it’s being offset by tremendous growth in our services business. The team has just done a fantastic job executing against that opportunity. And I guess, to Romit’s earlier question, this is how we are offsetting that weakness in display and still well on track to earning over $5 a share in 2020. We have got strong conviction, strong conviction in our markets, in the pipeline, in the execution, and backing it up with strong capital allocation, $2.6 billion in Q2 alone. And I guess, before we go, just look forward to seeing many of you at the following upcoming events. Gary and I are headed to Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference, first time for Applied; at the new AI conference for investors arranged by Newstreet Research; and at the Cowen, upcoming Cowen and BofA Merrill Lynch conferences. Thanks for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate it.
Gary Dickerson: Thank, Dan. And we would like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website by 5 p.m. Pacific Time. And we would like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we conclude our conference. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. I'm happy to report another record quarter for Applied, with revenue up nearly 30% from the same period last year. 2018 already looks like another great year, and we expect each of our three major business segments to deliver strong double-digit growth. We have tremendous momentum across the company and we are confident this momentum is sustainable for two reasons. First, we see an expanding set of market drivers as more and more industries are disrupted by emerging technologies, from retail to entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing and transportation. The way companies create value and compete increasingly depends on their ability to capture, store and understand huge amounts of data. The overall market for electronics is increasing and, as those electronics get smarter, semiconductor and display content grows even faster. Second, Applied is in a great position to outpace our markets. We are turning our investments into a strong pipeline of differentiated products, and we are using our broad set of capabilities to bring highly enabling new technologies to market faster than ever before. In today's call, I'll talk about the major trends driving sustainable growth in our markets. I'll describe our strategy and how we're translating our broad portfolio of products and capabilities into differentiated performance for our businesses. Then Dan will provide details about our financial execution and capital allocation, which reflects our increasing confidence in the sustainability of our markets. This is an incredibly exciting time in electronics industry because we are at the start of a new era of growth. The Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence will transform the economy over the next decade. As a result, a broad spectrum of companies are making substantial investments in these technologies to position themselves for the future. These large, powerful trends are already driving a fundamental shift in demand for semiconductors and displays. While these are only the early stages of AI and big data, there are already applications that have significant traction and are starting to scale. The first example is AI Natural Language Processing which is being integrated into more devices and driving silicon content at the edge and in the cloud. Voice assistants are fast becoming the hub for home automation. A typical voice assistant has around 30 chips and a total of 200 square millimeters of silicon, that's about twice the area of a smartphone application processor. Language processing is compute-intensive and the leading companies are building dedicated data centers to support it. These AI workloads require new server architectures that have up to eight times more logic and four times more memory content by area than traditional enterprise servers. Another important AI trend for 2018 is neural processing units in smartphones. This is a great example of AI at the edge, where machine learning is used to enable a phone's camera to identify and react to what it's seeing. The third example is self-driving cars. It's reported that $80 billion has already been invested as technology companies and traditional automakers race to get Level 4 vehicles to market. We believe Level 4 vehicles will have approximately eight times more silicon content than a standard car has today. These powerful emerging trends layer on top of traditional demand drivers, such as smartphones, data centers and storage, which continue to evolve and grow. We see leading cloud service providers announcing significant increases in their capital investments to expand data center capacity. To keep pace with the explosion of data generation, the storage market is growing rapidly, and NAND is taking a larger share. Recent data suggests that NAND will grow from 18% to about 30% of the total data storage market in the next three years. And while smartphone unit growth is relatively flat, the value of the silicon content in smartphones grew more than 30% in 2017. All these demand drivers add up to a very positive outlook for Applied's served markets. In Semiconductor, market fundamentals are strong, and we see disciplined investments in capacity and technology across a broadening customer base. Based on the timing of customer projects, we expect DRAM and logic spending to be higher in 2018, while the overall mix between foundry logic and memory investments will be similar to the 2017. We see a steady ramp of spending in China, which is positive for Applied because of our strong and growing market share and high service penetration at both multinational and domestic manufacturers. At the end of last year, we expected total wafer fab equipment spending in 2017 and 2018 combined would be more than $90 billion. As we look further ahead, we believe combined spending in 2018 and 2019 could be around $100 billion. While it's too early to comment on timing of that spending, we believe the overall trend line is clear. In Display, there are two equally large market inflections driving capital investments: the introduction of Gen 10.5 substrates for TV manufacturing and organic LED displays. In mobile, the transition to OLED displays is compelling. This is because rigid OLED offers significant performance, power and cost advantages over LCD, and flexible OLED will enable new form factors, such as curved and eventually foldable screens. As a result, our positive outlook for 2018 and beyond remains unchanged. Display is a unique growth driver for Applied, and we expect to increase our revenue by more than 30% in 2018 on top of nearly 60% growth last year. At Applied, our vision is to make possible the technology shaping the future, and we have aligned our investments and our organization around this vision. It is increasingly clear that the breadth of our capabilities and product portfolio is an important source of differentiation because we bring together the most enabling capabilities in one place. We are in a unique position to help customers accelerate their time to market, which is tremendously valuable to them. Against this backdrop, I'll now provide updates for each of our business segments. In calendar 2017, we grew our semiconductor process equipment business more than 40%, and our inspection and metrology business more than 10%. We expect to grow faster than these markets in 2018 and beyond with three major growth drivers. First, in areas where we're traditionally strong, we are extending our leadership. Our leadership products create the materials that determine the power, efficiency and performance of devices. To drive the major advances in transistor and interconnect needed to enable high-performance computing and AI, customers are increasing their focus on innovative materials and structures. This is translating to significant growth in areas like PVD, where we grew revenues about $800 million in 2017. Second, we're focused on capturing more share in markets where we have room to grow, specifically patterning, inspection and metrology. In patterning, we are providing materials-enabled solutions to customers' three most significant scaling challenges: resolution, the two-dimensional geometric shrinking of a device's features; 3D scaling, ways to increase transistor or memory cell density; and, increasingly important, placement, which is the vertical alignment between the layers of a device. By focusing on these key areas, we are on track to generate over $1 billion of patterning revenue in 2018. And regardless of EUV adoption, we expect our patterning opportunity to grow considerably over the next several years. Management of placement errors is also a driver for accelerated adoption of our e-beam inspection technologies. E-beam is the fastest-growing segment in the inspection and metrology market, and we're on track to grow significantly faster than the market in 2018. Third, we are finding new ways to combine our innovative technologies in materials deposition, materials removal, materials modification and materials analysis. Based on these capabilities, the pull from our customers for earlier and deeper collaborations is stronger than ever, and we're working with them to develop new solutions that accelerate their technology roadmaps and expand Applied's market opportunities. In Service, on a year-on-year basis, we've grown revenues every quarter since the end of 2013. And we're confident we can continue to grow at least 15% per year. This sustainable growth is driven by: a growing installed base, an increasing number of tools under long-term service agreements, and advanced service products that help customers shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and rapidly optimize their factory output and operating costs. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. With record performance in the first quarter, 2018 is off to a great start. And we're confident we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our Semiconductor, Display and Service businesses. We see sustainable strength in our markets as new demand drivers, including IoT, big data and AI, layer on top of traditional computing and mobility. Applied is uniquely positioned to outperform our markets as we enable customers to accelerate their device roadmaps using our broad portfolio of products and capabilities. Now, Dan will give his perspective on our financial execution and outlook, as well as provide additional color on our capital allocation.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Gary. I'd like to begin by sharing some of my observations about the environment Gary described and discuss how we plan to allocate the company's capital as a result. The semiconductor industry is fueling a new data economy. And today, we're already seeing record semiconductor industry revenue of over $400 billion. We're excited about the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, and we believe this next era of computing will be built out over the next decade or more. Of course, nobody can guarantee that the growth will follow a straight line, but the future we envision is nondiscretionary to the world's largest industries, and semiconductor process technology and systems are at the foundation. All of the leading indicators of our equipment business are positive, and Gary shared that we see strength in 2018 and 2019. I believe WFE spending is going to remain significantly higher and less cyclical than it was during the PC era, which many people still identify with. Consider these facts, 300-millimeter technology arrived in the year 2000 and gave customers 2.3 times the number of chips for every wafer. While semiconductor revenue grew, equipment spending actually declined between 2000 and 2013 as WFE intensity dropped from a peak of 17% to a low of 9% over that same time period. But from 2013 to 2017, while semiconductor sales grew, wafer fab equipment grew even faster, and WFE intensity kicked higher to 12%. With technology getting more complex, I think it's hard to imagine WFE intensity drifting much lower. So consider what happens if the semiconductor industry grows from today's levels at a modest 5% pace, as multiple forecasts predict. Then if WFE intensity stays flat at 12%, WFE investments of $50 billion or more should not be considered unusual in the near term, and spending could potentially reach $75 billion by the middle of the next decade. We'll leave forecasting to others. The point I want to make is that demand is much broader today than during the PC area. WFE intensity has stabilized and the industry is likely to be a lot more attractive in the years ahead. So, the future looks bright especially for Applied Materials because we have a growing Semi business, a growing Services business and a unique growth opportunity in Display. I believe Applied Materials will become larger and more profitable and generate significantly more free cash flow than we do today. Against this backdrop, here is how we plan to deploy the company's capital going forward. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. Our first priority is to invest in the growth of the business with an emphasis on organic growth. We will continue to invest with discipline. This means every dollar of R&D is tied to an attractive margin target, and we will continue to look every quarter for opportunities to shift money from lower return areas to high return areas before increasing R&D. We will also stay laser focused on maintaining G&A efficiency. Our second priority is to maintain a robust and flexible balance sheet. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade credit rating. Our third priority is to return excess cash to our shareholders. In fact, since 2000, Applied has returned nearly 90% of free cash flow to shareholders. And today, we're announcing a change in the dividend policy. We've said that our markets are bigger and less volatile, which gives us the opportunity to pay higher dividends. Applied's Board of Directors has approved a 100% increase in the quarterly cash dividend and declared the first $0.20 quarterly dividend will be payable in June. We'll review our distribution practices on a regular basis and evaluate further dividend increases as we continue to grow the business. At the same time, we strongly believe in the future growth and value creation of the company. Accordingly, the board has also increased our buyback authorization by $6 billion. Combined with more than $2.8 billion remaining from the previous authorization, we have a significant opportunity to increase shareholder value through buybacks. We plan to be opportunistic, repurchasing more shares when we believe they are significantly undervalued. Next, I'll discuss the impacts of the U.S. corporate tax reform, which is beneficial to Applied because it gives us greater flexibility in how we deploy future profits to serve our customers, grow the company, and return capital to our shareholders. With freer access to profits generated offshore, we now have greater flexibility to invest within the U.S., where we do much of our advanced technology development and manufacturing. This year, we plan to add new engineering jobs in the U.S. and invest in new labs and office space to support our growth objectives. In Q1, the new tax legislation resulted in a one-time repatriation tax of about $1 billion. As you may know, the tax amount is payable over eight years and the payments are significantly back-end weighted. Because of this one-time repatriation tax, Applied's GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 88.4%. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 6.3% for Q1, and we're using a 6.5% tax rate in our planning for the rest of fiscal 2018. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 12%. This increase reflects a minimum tax on foreign income that becomes effective next year. Now I'll comment on our financial execution in Q1. We delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in both revenue and non-GAAP EPS, which was $1.06, or $1.02 when excluding a $0.04 tax benefit. On a year-over-year non-GAAP basis, we increased gross margin by 1.3 points, reduced OpEx as a percent of sales by 2.3 points and grew operating margin by 3.6 points. Turning to the segments. We delivered record revenue and operating profit in both semi equipment and Services. In Semi equipment, we grew revenue by 32% year-on-year and delivered the highest operating margin in over seven years. I'm particularly impressed with the growth of our Services business. AGS grew revenue by 30% year-over-year, which was above our expectation mainly due to higher-than-expected spare parts demand. AGS also delivered record operating margin. In Display, revenue and operating margin were both lower sequentially following a record Q4, which we anticipated due to lumpiness of the business. We expect Display revenue and operating margin to trend higher in the balance of the year. Now I'll share our business outlook for Q2. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.35 billion to $4.55 billion. The midpoint would be up nearly 26% year-over-year. We expect Semiconductor Systems revenue and Services revenue to both increase by about 23% year-over-year, and our Display revenue should increase by about 48% year-over-year. We expect the non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be approximately flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $755 million, plus or minus $10 million. At the midpoint, OpEx would be approximately 17% of revenue, down 1.4 points year-over-year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.14, plus or minus $0.04. The midpoint of the range is up nearly 44% year-over-year. And now I'll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Now, to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please just poll the operator and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: Thank you, sir. And our first question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations on a strong beating rate. The first question for Gary, Gary, can you just talk about the mix of mobile versus TV in your unchanged 30% year-over-year outlook for Display business?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Sure. Thanks, Atif. Just overall, again, in 2018, we're still seeing 30%, greater than 30% growth, and 2019 and beyond also look very strong. If we look at 2018, mobile versus TV, your question, it's about 50/50 mix. In TV, we see increased adoption of larger screens. We're tracking 13 Gen 10.5 projects. And also, a great example here is on 65-inch TVs. If you produce them with Gen 10.5, you have eight 65-inch TVs, only three with Gen 8.5. So that's driving the TV business. OLED is the other half of our business in 2018, and we still see very strong opportunity in OLED. Previously, we had one customer that was more than 50% of the business. Now, greater than 50% of the business is coming from multiple customers. We talked about 10 customers in OLED. And the transition to OLED displays is really compelling. Rigid OLED gives you better performance, faster refresh rates, power cost advantages over LCD. Flexible OLED gives you new form factors such as curved displays and eventually foldable screens. So again, we're on track for greater than 30% growth in 2018 and on track with our longer-term model.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Atif.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question for you around your capital allocation plan. Obviously, with the doubling of the dividend, you're feeling good about the sustainability of this heightened level of spending in WFE. Would be curious to hear your thoughts around your framework of returning that capital. You announced a buyback program that's now $8.8 billion. Would love to hear whether that is going to be opportunistic or systematic. Overall, would generally like to hear how you think about free cash flow generation and plans to return excess back to shareholders. Thank you.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, C.J. Let me see if I can help you with that. So as you point out, we do see strength in our end markets. We're really encouraged by the diversification of those end markets. We're encouraged by capital intensity rising, and we're encouraged by the health of our customers. So we've got a strong view of our markets into the future. From a capital allocation standpoint, the company's got a great history. Since 2000, the company has returned nearly 90% of free cash flow back to shareholders. As part of this announcement, we're changing the mix a bit. We're going to increase our dividend by 100%. We've also announced a $6 billion share repurchase, when combined with the $2.8 billion that was outstanding from the prior authorization, gives us an opportunity to opportunistically be in the market to drive even more value for shareholders. And so we feel good about our end markets. We feel very good about the performance of the company. And we're going to remain committed to being very shareholder-friendly with our excess free cash flow.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. My first question is on the long-term drivers for the business. You talked about AI, IoT and the general data economy. Have you guys done any sort of work to figure out what portion of the business is currently being supported by these non-consumer markets?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: So, as we look into the end markets and what's driving WFE, what we see is a lot of confidence in macro trends that are going to be driving a significant amount of efficiency into very large industries, and we see that spend as non-discretionary. It is foundational to company's competitiveness. It's difficult to unpack those macro trends and slice them by WFE to see what part of WFE specifically supports each trend. What we see is a noticeably larger end market. We see strength across all device types, whether it's logic foundry, whether it's memory. And within logic foundry, we see strength in both end markets. Within memory, we see strength in both NAND and DRAM. So we're really encouraged by the breadth of the strength we're seeing and we think it bodes well for the market. But I think it's too difficult to unpack specifically how much is attributed to which end market trend.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Farhan.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon and congratulations on another well-executed quarter. Good to see the boost in the capital return program, and this goes back to your previous answer. But if I use net income as a proxy for free cash flow, this calendar year, you guys are going to be generating about $4 billion in free cash flow. So the dividend increase you guys announced today is going to consume about 20% of that free cash flow. I guess, the question is, is the team committed over a multiyear period to its 90% free cash flow return, which would imply, at least for this year, about $3.2 billion in repurchase activity? And the reason why I ask this is that many semi companies and some of your peers are articulating capital return as a percent of free cash flow. So, I guess, the question is 90% of free cash flow, is that how we should think about the capital return commitment from the team on a go-forward basis?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Harlan. Let me see if I can add a little more color on this to try to be helpful. I would look at the 90% historical number as a mindset of this management team, as a mindset of Applied Materials, to be committed to getting cash back in the hands of shareholders. We're going to remain committed to that going forward. I don't think what you will see from us is a formulaic approach to that. From a dividend standpoint, we made a big move on the dividend. We are going to continue to look at the performance of the business and the way we grow the business and review that policy on the periodic basis and look to grow our dividend as we grow the business. We're going to compliment that, the way we have historically, by being aggressive repurchasers of our shares when we feel intrinsic value is not fully reflected in the trading price of our stock. And we're going to continue to do that. So, rather than be formulaic, I think we're going to look to be opportunistic with the repurchase, committed to the dividend, committed to reviewing that policy over time as we grow the business. And I think our track record into the future will be similar as our historical track record of getting a substantial amount of excess free cash flow back to shareholders. But we do not want to be formulaic in that approach today.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Harlan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Dan, you're guiding gross margin this quarter flat sequentially despite Display becoming a bigger percentage of your overall business, which I think historically would have been detrimental to gross margins. So, I guess, what's driving the fundamental improvement in gross margins? And longer term, you've shared the 47% target in your midterm plan. But we're kind of there. So how should we think about potential upside from there going forward? Thank you.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Toshiya. So the company's got a really good track record over the last four years. Last four years, we've improved gross margin by 5 points. We've also articulated a model that says we're going to capture about 70 basis points of material costs of sales savings each year as we drive the business forward. That model still holds. But that's assuming a constant mix. You rightfully point out that we're going to have composition of our business, the mix composition of our business that's going to create a bit of a headwind and mask some of that ornamental progress. So to see a quarter where we see strong sequential growth in Display and have us hold the gross margin flat I think is a reflection of all the hard work that's going on behind the scenes to continue to drive the profitability of the company. What I would say is, our long-term model, we'd like to articulate a long-term model once a year during our Analyst Day and resist the temptation to update it along the way. What I would say is that we're going to be aggressive about looking for opportunities to do better than what we've advertised in our long-term model. And where we see opportunities, we will pursue it aggressively and make sure we're delivering as much value as possible for shareholders. Given the mix of businesses and the growth profile going forward, we'd like to stay consistent with our 47% gross margin out into the 2020 timeframe. And if we have an update, we'll review it in the fall at our Analyst Day.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Toshiya.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I wonder when you talk about the $100 billion of WFE for the next two years versus the $90 billion you talked about for the next years 12 months ago, how much of that increment do you think is coming from which segment and how much is memory versus foundry logic? And is there a level where you start to feel like you start to worry about the supply growth being too high or just how are you guys thinking about these levels, because they keep kind of ratcheting higher?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. So, implicit in the question is a framing that says we're ratcheting our estimates higher. What I would say is we're extending the range of our forecast out into the 2019 timeframe. And we feel really good about our end markets. What we're encouraged by is driven by three primary reasons. Macro trends, diversification of our demand drivers is the first. Second, capital intensity is up across the board, and that's all device types. And the third, customers are very, very healthy right now. So just double-clicking on each of those three elements, we've got macro trends shaping how we live our lives right now. We've been thinking about it for a while I think probably back into 2016 timeframe at our Analyst Day. Artificial intelligence, big data, Internet of Things, autonomous driving, these are playing out. We view these trends as real. They're making an impact. Demand for silicon is going up. Semiconductors are on the critical path of enabling each of these trends. Content in data centers is going up, content in edge devices is going up, and again, we're seeing strength across all device types. So the macro trends are incredibly favorable. As we look at capital intensity, capital intensity is up across the board. In foundry, 7-nanometer is up 100% over 28-nanometer. Memory, both NAND and DRAM is up between 40% and 60% over that same time period. Foundry is three times more capital-intensive than the memory market. And we used to have wafer size transitions where you would get 2.3 times the number of chips per wafer, for instance, when you go from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter. The last transition was at – in the year 2000. WFE intensity went from 17% in that year to a low of 9% in 2013 when all of the efficiency gains of that transition were absorbed. And from 2013 to today, we've seen it trend up from that 9% to 12%. And we don't have another wafer size transition on the horizon, so we feel really good about the capital intensity that underpins our markets. And I guess, the third thing, customers are healthy. They're investing a lot of money to drive this growth into the semiconductor industry, but they're also making a lot of money. Their WFE spend as a percent of EBITDA is down. In 2012 to 2018, the three largest memory providers and the three largest foundry logic providers are all down 60% WFE spend as a percent of EBITDA. So we're really encouraged by what we see. Macro is good, markets are good and customers are profitable. We think it's a really healthy market, we're encouraged by it.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Gary, in your prepared remark, you talked about some of that share gains you've generated over the past few years, particularly in patterning and e-beam inspection. A lot of it is due to the industry transition to 3D NAND and your ability to introduce some of the new products for that product. At the same time, we're seeing now the industry transition on the logic side to 10 and 7 nanometers. Can you discuss some of the opportunities there and maybe some of the share gain potential you have as that segment of the market makes a pretty sizable transition?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Sure, Patrick. Let me first start kind of big picture, and then I'll cover the question on the – that you asked. So, in 2017, we grew process equipment more than 40%. PDC grew about 10%. Now, if you look back over the last three years, 2014 to 2017, process equipment grew much faster than the PDC market. And we see that playing out in 2018, and probably in future years also. But again, process equipment, very, very strong growth, and as you said, very strong balance for us. It used to be that, if it was a good foundry year, Applied would do well and not as well on the memory years. We've increased our share of memory about 7% over the last few years of total spending. So, in 2017, we had very balanced share in all the different segments, device segments, around 20% or more in all of those different segments. And then what we're looking for 2018 is strong double-digit growth in our leadership businesses, in our growth businesses and also in PDC. PDC, we have new capabilities, new products that will increase our growth a fair amount above what we accomplished in 2017. In foundry, there really are two big drivers. And one of those drivers is in the trailing geometries. There was question earlier about AI and what's driving AI. We really have data generation, many, many smart devices, data storage, and then you have the high-performance computing to process the information. So, if you look at the trailing geometries, China is increasing investment in 2018 a fair amount both with domestic and global companies. We have a great position in China. It's one of our highest share positions in Semiconductor and Display. And we expect that we'll outgrow the market in China in 2018. Patterning is a great opportunity for us. We've gained about 19 points of share in patterning over the last few years. If we look forward, patterning in 2020 will be about a $5 billion TAM. We anticipate that we could add another $1 billion approximately in revenue over the next four years in patterning. And then if you look at scaling challenges, scaling, you have different drivers. One is resolution, two-dimensional shrinking of features. Their multi-patterning is growing. 80% layers are multi-patterning. Those are growing, and that's a great opportunity for Applied Materials. 3D scaling certainly happened in 2D to 3D NAND, but you also see that in logic. The contact over active gate is one example where you see that, and that's also materials-enabled scaling for customers. And certainly, you see that in high-performance computing and advanced foundry and logic. And then another big industry challenge where we're in a great position, one of the biggest challenges for customers is pattern placement, the alignment of one layer to the next, edge placement errors. And there was a conference in early January; two of the top technologists from leading companies talked about edge placement errors being one of the biggest industry challenges. And what they said was that materials is the key driver for solutions to pattern placement. And if you look at our position with all of the selective technologies we have and materials technologies we have, we're in a very strong position to grow, especially in foundry, foundry and logic, as they move to these new technologies. So again, overall 2017, we grew over 40% in process equipment. We see strong double-digit growth in all of our segments, leadership, growth, PDC. And the other thing I would say that we're seeing tremendous pull from customers is accelerating their roadmap. If they can bring those high-performance computing or AI chips to market faster, that's worth a tremendous amount of money and our ability to create, modify, remove and analyze materials is really unique. So we're seeing deeper engagements with customers than we've ever seen in the past, and I would say I've never been more optimistic about our markets and also our positions in those markets.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Sorry about the background noise. So I have a question about China. You guys sound pretty confident about investment by the local Chinese manufacturer, but these sort of new players, we haven't seen a lot of products coming out of there or even design come out of that. What gives you confidence that that investment will come maybe later this year or 2019, 2020 timeframe?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we have pretty significant visibility in China. We have the highest share. We also sell the manufacturing automation systems. So we have a lot of leading indicators relative to all the projects that are happening in China. And as I said earlier, we have the largest share and our share is growing in China, both in Semiconductor and in Display. And what we'll see in 2018 is a market that's going to grow. We're more optimistic, I would say, in terms of the growth in China. It's pretty balanced between global and domestic companies. And again, we're working very closely with all of those different companies. Domestic China is higher in foundry and logic than it is in memory. And one of the things that we talked about was data generation, smarter devices, the increasing sensor technologies. That's an area where China has capability, and certainly the demand for those trailing geometries is now 40% of the foundry market and we're seeing very strong growth there in China. For the global companies, they are more weighted towards memory versus foundry and logic. Another thing that Dan talked about in the prepared remarks was our service growth. I think something like 30% year-over-year in service. China is also a market where our penetration in service is very high, helping global and local of companies ramp new fabs in new locations. And so we had some one-time parts increases in our quarter that increased the rate of growth in service above the model that we gave. We think we may be a few points higher than that model, but that certainly contributed to an extraordinary quarter relative to service growth. So anyway, we have very, very good visibility in China. The investments there are strategic investments, and we believe that that's going to remain a very good market and especially good for Applied Materials.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah, I just want to build on very quickly the point Gary was making about our Services business. I think the way we profile this year from a service perspective will be different than we've seen historically because of the dynamic Gary talked about. I think you'll see a seasonally stronger first half and different profile into the back half of the year as a couple of these fabs facilitated by international customers are brought online in China. I think the way to think about the back half of the year, because you've got visibility now on Q1 and Q2, think about the back half of the year, is take our long-term compound growth rate in our Services business of 15%. And as you look at full year 2018 revenue over full year 2017 revenue, we're likely to be about 3 points above our long-term compound growth rate. I think that gives you a good framing on how to think about the Services business throughout the course of the year so you can dial in your models.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks for the question, Edwin.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks very much. In terms of the growth you're expecting in display equipment this year, is this driven primarily by growth in your traditional display products or you're seeing – are you seeing meaningful new – meaningful growth from moving into new areas and increasing your addressed market in display?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: So, the display market in 2018 is roughly 50% TV and 50% mobile. And they're really with the same products that we have – had in the market previously. So no real growth from significant new products forecasted in 2018. And the mix is really about 50/50 between mobile and TV.
David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. If you look back at the last calendar year, by my math, your Semi System business grew about 34%, which is obviously very impressive. And it's also just a few percentage points better than the WFE market. But the outperformance was much higher the year before. When you talk about your expected business to grow – outgrow the market again this year, do you expect that outperformance to reaccelerate this year?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, again, if you breakdown our business, the process equipment business grew more than 40% in 2017. PDC grew 10%. So it was more growth in terms of the process equipment business. If we look into 2018, we see strong double-digit growth really across all of those different businesses, the growth businesses, the leadership businesses, where we have extremely high market share, and also in PDC. So strong growth across all of them, strong double-digit growth across all of those businesses in 2018.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Sidney. And then, operator, I'd like to let you know that we've got time for about two more questions, please, if we have them.
Operator: Yes, sir. Our next questions will come from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the very good quarterly execution and the evolution and capital return. Gary, I just wanted to go back to the multi-year outlook and see if I could get some color from you just on how you're thinking about the potential for growth in 2019. I know it may be early to be real precise there, but it seems like a lot of the secular factors that are helping cause be uplift from where we've been as an industry to where we are now, we're multi-year in nature and they would seem to be as or more forceful next year. So any color on the potential for WFE growth next year would be appreciated. Thank you.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Craig. I'll go ahead and jump in and take this. I think it's too early to tell how spending profiles across that two-year sequence. I think it's important to just take a step back and look at what's really driving our view on a multi-year basis. Macro trends are real. Capital intensity is up, and we're seeing modest and disciplined growth into China. Again, we think these macro trends shaping people's lives. We're in the early innings. Gary referenced $80 billion of investments in autonomous vehicles. By 2020, eight OEMs are going to have Level 4 vehicles on the road. By 2022, it's 12 OEMs. We're in the early stages of SSD penetration of hard disk drives. And when we correlate it bottoms up with dialogue we have with customers, all indicators look good the best we can see, and fundamentals continue to look good into 2019. So while those trends we have a lot of confidence in, too early to call how revenue profiles over the forecast horizon.
Operator: Thank you. And your last question will come from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on how you're thinking about the buybacks. You laid out a very positive long-term outlook. And if I do like a DCF around it, I can get like a very significant upside from where your share prices currently are. So, is it fair to think that you could be a lot more opportunistic with the buybacks and it could be more front half loaded if share prices are around current level?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Farhan. Like we said, we will be opportunistic with our repurchases. We've got a strong point of view on where the markets are going and how our company is performing within those respective markets gives us a lot of confidence in what the future holds for our business, more profitable, substantively higher free cash flow generation potential. And whenever we see disconnects in intrinsic value as we see it in our company and how we trade in the market, I think you'll see us be opportunistic with respect to those repurchases.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Okay, Farhan, thanks for the question. Let's see, Dan, anything you want to add before we close the call?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think it's probably good to close with a couple of quick thoughts. Personally, I can't think of a better time to be in the semiconductor industry. We talked a lot about multiple growth drivers that are important trends shaping our lives. These trends are going to drive tremendous productivity and the investments are non-discretionary for some of the largest, most competitive industries on the planet. It is fundamentally about staying competitive. Semiconductors are on the critical path of enabling those trends, and at the center of it, it all begins with what we do with Applied. When we bring all of this together, Applied's future is incredibly bright. Our breadth and depth is just an asset for the company. We are likely to be sustainably bigger, more profitable and we're going to generate more cash than in the past. And as we think about putting that cash to use, we talked about three important ways. Number one, we're going to invest in new products. This is going to lead the way and drive the organic growth profile we've seen over the last few years. We will invest to drive organic growth. We will pay higher dividends and we're going to be buying back more shares to drive even more shareholder value going forward. Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you. We're going to be at the Goldman conference tomorrow, and then next week and we'll be on the road in New York, Boston or Toronto. And, as always, thanks for joining us and we really appreciate the support. So, Mike, let's go ahead and close the call.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Okay, great. Hey, thanks for that, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of our call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program, and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day.

On November 10, Applied celebrated our 50th anniversary, and in this milestone year, we delivered all-time record performance, far exceeding our previous highs. In fiscal 2017, we grew revenues 34% and operating profit at more than twice that rate. I'd like to thank all our employees for making this a great year for Applied, and their passion for creating value for customers and shareholders. It's Applied's breadth that sets us apart, and across the company, we are firing on all cylinders. We have tremendous momentum and our outlook is strengthening. I'm confident that in 2018, we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our semiconductor, display and service businesses. Applied is working at the foundation of major technology trends and playing a larger and more valuable role in the electronics industry. Our vision is to make possible the technology shaping the future, and we've never been in a better position to do that. In today's call, I'll talk about our markets and the large emerging trends that are driving sustainable growth in semiconductor and display. I'll describe how Applied is positioned, our strategy and how we're translating our broad portfolio of products and capabilities into differentiated performance for the company. Dan will then provide more details about our execution, financial performance and outlook. Let me start by providing context. Our markets are strong and getting stronger, because there's a much broader set of demand drivers than in the past. In the annual war for leadership in the smartphone market, handset manufacturers are adding more and more functionality to their devices. IoT applications are expanding rapidly and data generation is exploding. Major inflections are taking place in the data center, and there's an emerging battle for leadership in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. And there is huge demand for new display technology, while at the same time, average screen sizes for both TVs and mobile devices are growing considerably. A customer recently told me that this is the most exciting time in the history of the electronics industry, and I strongly agreed. We are at the start of a completely new wave of growth. The Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence have the potential to transform entire industries and create trillions of dollars of economic value. As a result, we are seeing a broad spectrum of companies investing in AI-related technology. From transportation and health care to entertainment and retail, future success is dependent on capturing, storing, and understanding vast amounts of data. This is driving major innovations in sensors, memory, storage, and especially compute, which is key to turning raw data into valuable information. Leading AI companies are telling us they need a step change in computing performance. This is driving a trend towards new highly-specialized architectures customized for AI workloads as well as much larger chips. Huge advancements in computing are taking place both in the cloud and at the edge. For applications where latency and security are important, like autonomous vehicles, natural language processing or safety systems, data will be processed and stored at the edge. This means more logic and memory content in edge devices, where power requirements are much more critical than in the cloud. The AI architecture war is shaping up to be the biggest battle of our lifetimes and is going to be a major driver for the logic foundry road map. The winning architectures will provide large improvements in performance and power, and Applied is in a unique position to deliver the innovative materials needed to enable AI leadership. I'll now translate these end-market trends into an outlook for our served markets. In memory, shipments are at record levels, and market dynamics remain very healthy. DRAM and NAND content in smartphones is growing considerably. For example, the average NAND content in entry-level phones has doubled from 32 gigabytes in 2016 to 64 gigabytes today. Content is also growing in the data center, and the total cost of ownership of NAND-based solid-state drives is on track to cross over 10K hard disk drives in 2018, increasing the SSD opportunity to around 35% of the enterprise storage market. Overall, bit demand growth remains strong, in a range of 20% to 25% for DRAM and greater than 40% for NAND. Our customers are making disciplined investments in both capacity and new technology to address the explosion of data generation and the need for high-performance memory to support emerging applications. And as the memory road map is enabled by materials innovation, this is very positive for Applied. In foundry, we see strong demand at the leading edge, driven by next-generation mobile devices, automotive and high-performance computing. We're also seeing significant investment in trailing geometries, especially for image sensors. This is driven by the adoption of dual cameras in smartphones as well as IoT devices, including public safety systems. Looking ahead, we expect the emerging battle for leadership in AI and high-performance computing to be a major driver for the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes. Increasing investment in China is additive to overall wafer fab equipment and especially good for Applied, since we have very high share in this market. We now see total spending in China being around $2 billion higher in 2018 compared to 2017, with more significant growth to come over the next several years. Bringing all of this together, our outlook for wafer fab equipment spending has strengthened since our Analyst Meeting in September. We now believe combined investment in 2017 and 2018 will be several billion dollars above our prior forecast of $90 billion and that 2018 will be larger than this year. This positive market environment increases our confidence that we will sustain our growth momentum in 2018 and make meaningful progress towards our 2020 financial model. Applied has never been in a better position than we are today, thanks to the breadth of our capabilities and product portfolio. Our breadth not only gives us by far the largest exposure to industry inflections, it also is creating strong pull for earlier and deeper collaborations with customers. In these customer engagements, we are combining our unique capabilities to create new materials with our innovative technologies in materials removal, materials modification and e-beam inspection and metrology to deliver new integrated solutions. Our breadth also provides us with speed advantages. Speed of innovation is more important than ever for our customers, and bringing new devices to market faster is tremendously valuable. Because we bring together the most enabling capabilities in one place, we can help customers to develop winning devices faster and more effectively. To strengthen customer collaborations that are made in technology center and in their labs, we recently aligned the organization to better connect our broad capabilities across the company. We also increased our R&D investment by more than $230 million in 2017. In semiconductor, our process equipment businesses, that provide materials engineering solutions, grew about 40% in fiscal 2017; and our inspection and metrology business grew at around 20%, delivering all-time record revenues. This was an especially strong year for our PVD, CMP and thermal products, driven by the mass adoption of advanced interconnects in logic as well as increasing use of logic-like processes in memory. We also made strong gains in patterning and 3D NAND, and we're in a great position to grow in DRAM, as customers transition to new higher-performance devices over the next several years. As we look ahead, we see customers increasing their focus on innovative materials and structures to drive the major advances in transistor and interconnect needed to enable high-performance computing in AI. As a result, there is increasingly strong pull for our leadership products that improve performance and power efficiency of leading-edge devices. In service, our momentum is accelerating as we introduce new ways to deliver value to customers. We delivered record performance in 2017, with fourth quarter revenues up 20% compared to the same period last year. In 2017, the fastest-growing business in our portfolio was display, with revenue growth of 57% year-on-year. Due to the physical size of display equipment, lead times are much longer than in semiconductor, and that gives us extended visibility. We expect 2018 and 2019 will be very strong. In our last earnings call, we said 2018 display revenue would be up more than 30% versus 2017. Our view for 2018 is now even more positive, and we see revenue growth exceeding our previous estimates. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll quickly summarize. Fiscal 2017 was a record-breaking year for the company. We have great momentum, and we're confident that in 2018, we can deliver strong double-digit growth across our semiconductor, display and service businesses. This is underpinned by sustainable strength in our markets. As new demand drivers layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, AI will transform industries over the coming years, and Applied plays a fundamental role creating the materials that enable the next-generation of memory and high-performance computing. In addition, Applied is uniquely positioned to drive differentiated performance, thanks to the breadth of our portfolio of products and capabilities. Now, Dan will give his perspective on our execution and outlook.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Gary. Let me start by saying that the semiconductor industry is more exciting today than it's been in many years. This is absolutely the perfect environment for Applied Materials, because we're the biggest, broadest and most capable company in delivering leading-edge process technology to our customers. The future Gary described needs an order of magnitude improvement in processing performance and in performance per watt, plus geometric cost reductions in solid-state storage, the future is not going to happen with the same chips and chip-making methods that got us to where we are today. Shrinking isn't enough anymore. We also need breakthroughs in materials, materials engineering, which is why we're so focused on disruptive products, new material combinations and rapid learning. For me personally, it's been an amazing and eye-opening three months. So much of what the semiconductor industry does begins with Applied Materials. The talent and the technology inside this company are second to none, and we're going to play a huge role in enabling the new AI era of computing. Now, I'll talk about what we're focusing on and how we're executing as a company. First, we're focused on making sure we're putting our R&D dollars to work in the right areas, to create and enable the inflections, and to grow in those inflections. We're also focused on being disciplined execution machine we need to be, to satisfy our customers and investors and keep increasing our profitability and shareholder returns. Since it's the end of our fiscal year, I'll summarize how we're doing across the major parts of our portfolio. As I outlined at the Analyst Day in New York, our Semiconductor Systems group has a wide range of product lines that can be summarized in two areas; leadership and high growth. In leadership semi, we have unique, strong share of businesses that enable high-performance, low-power transistors and interconnects. Our team is focused on expanding our reach beyond logic and foundry, because DRAM and NAND chips also need to be faster and consume less power. This is increasingly true in both AI workloads and cloud data centers. Within memory, our leadership semi businesses were up 45% year-over-year. Over the past four years, they've grown by a factor of four in memory, contributing an additional $1.5 billion in revenue growth and 2.5 points of our company's share gain in memory over that same time period. I'll share some of the applications that are driving this great performance. When NAND moved to 3D, our epi technology was adopted to increase read and write speeds. Today, in DRAM, the control circuitry is adopting advanced logic structures, to increase data access performance and reduce power consumption. This is driving more demand for our PVD, implant and thermal technologies. The second area of our Semiconductor Systems group are high-growth semi businesses, are about cost-effective 2D and 3D scaling. Our teams have been extending our wins in 3D NAND to new wins in 2D scaling. The old patterning steps are being replaced with new techniques, including self-aligned multi-patterning and EUV. Applied is growing and gaining share in these areas, because we introduced new platforms, including Sym3 and Selectra. The greatest challenge in advance patterning is aligning the features between the critical layers. We are solving this challenge with new materials-based alignment techniques, along with EB measurement and inspection. As a result, our patterning share is growing by four points year-over-year, and our Imaging and Process Control group generated its highest revenue ever. Our services business is about helping our customers to manage the increasing process complexity and generate high returns in an era of higher capital intensity. This year, we drove a 25% increase in tools under comprehensive service agreements. The agreements enable us to generate more value by helping our customers get to yield faster, and maintain higher yields and lower operating costs over the life of each node. We grew our services business by 17% this year to a record $3 billion, and plan to keep growing at a 15% compound rate through 2020. Our display business is about bigger and better TVs, along with mobile displays that are thinner, lighter and better looking than ever. The team has done an excellent job in ramping a new generation of our tools for Gen 10.5 display factories. Gen 10.5 substrates are 80% larger and will allow customers to make the leap to affordable 65-inch and 75-inch TVs. In mobile, our team established the leading position in thin-film encapsulation, which enables OLED smartphones that are now the hottest selling products of the leading brands. We grew the display business to a record $1.9 billion this year. While the business units are generating product wins and strong revenue growth, the manufacturing and support organizations are also executing well. Our manufacturing teams are delivering 1.4 times the volume of prior-year years, and at the same time, they've reduced cycle times while improving our overall quality metrics. Going forward, we will keep a sharp focus on further improving our operational performance, cost structure and continuing to drive spending discipline. Now, I'll share our financial performance. We're pleased to report that in Q4, we delivered strong year-over-year growth across the company. In Semiconductor Systems, we grew revenue by 14% and non-GAAP operating profit by 19%. In services, we increased both revenue and non-GAAP operating profit by 20%. And in display, we grew revenue by 50% and non-GAAP operating profit by 109%. Applied as a whole delivered record revenue and earnings in Q4, landing near the high-end of our guidance range. Our 2017 fiscal year was our best ever. We grew revenue by 34% to a new record level. We increased non-GAAP gross margin by 2.9 points. We reduced non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue by 3.2 points. We increased non-GAAP operating profit by 6.2 points, and grew non-GAAP EPS by 86% to a record $3.25. All of this resulted in record operating cash flow of $3.6 billion, equal to 25% of revenue. We paid $430 million in cash dividends, and we used $1.2 billion to repurchase 28 million shares of common stock at an average price of $42.08. Now, I'll turn to our outlook. Looking ahead to 2018 and 2019, one word leaps to mind, sustainability. Our markets are sustainably strong and our momentum is sustainably strong. Gary mentioned that wafer fab equipment is going to be comfortably above $90 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. We believe WFE will remain sustainably higher and more stable than in the past. There are three strong reasons for this. First, unit demand is growing. Second, capital intensity is higher. And lastly, our customers are very healthy, and making sound investments to generate profitable growth in the next wave of computing, which will take a decade or more to fully build out. In fact, the markets for chips and displays are both fundamentally strong. And that's great for Applied Materials, as the company with the most growth levers in our space. We enable better smartphones and TVs, and we power the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence, which together, are creating a new data economy At the Analyst Day, Gary showed that Applied now captures 1% of all of the spending in the electronics industry and that our share has doubled in the past four years alone. In January, Gary and I are attending the Consumer Electronics show to meet with investors and explain how we'll continue to grow the company by enabling these major trends shaping how we live our lives. In today's earnings release, we included a table detailing our year-end backlog. It gives you a better sense of the year we just had, and more importantly, our momentum going into 2018. In 2017, Applied generated record orders of $16.1 billion, and we ended the year with a record backlog of over $6 billion and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11. Our backlog entering 2018 is large and broad-based; in semi, it's $3 billion; in services, it's $1.1 billion; and in display, $1.85 billion. In 2018, we anticipate that each of our segments will grow faster than the rate needed to achieve our 2020 model on schedule. So, we're off to a great start executing to the target model we discussed at our recent Analyst Day in New York. Now, I'll share our guidance. In Q1, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.2 billion, the midpoint would be up nearly 25% year-over-year. We expect our Semiconductor Systems revenue to increase by about 32% year-over-year. We expect our services revenue to grow about 17% year-over-year, but will be lower sequentially, which is normal seasonality due to the customer production schedules during the holiday season. We expect our display revenue to increase by about 6% year-over-year. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be about 46.6%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $715 million, plus or minus $10 million. This amount includes holiday shutdown savings of nearly $10 million. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.98, plus or minus $0.04. The midpoint of our range is up nearly 46% year-over-year. Lastly, because it's the beginning of a new year, I wanted to offer you some help with your models. Gross margins for full-year 2018 are likely to be near our guidance level for Q1. We remain laser-focused on gross margin improvements across our businesses, and some of our progress is likely to be masked by a rapid growth in display throughout the year. Our display outlook is stronger. And while Q1 display revenue and operating margin will be lower sequentially, we expect both to be higher in the balance of the year. We recently increased our display operating margin goal to the high-20s. And our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to be around 10%. I hope this additional color helps with your models. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. Now to help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please poll the operator and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let's please begin.
Unverified Participant: Good afternoon.
Operator: And your first question comes from C. J. Muse from Evercore.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you for taking my question. I guess my question centers around the operating margin targets. And you're hovering around 29% here and you're targeting a 2020 model of 29.6%. And I guess, thinking about the growth dynamics that you've outlined, as well as the fact that you need to obviously continue to invest in R&D, we'd love to hear kind of the push and pull that you see ahead? And would you agree that perhaps your target model is a bit conservative? Would love to hear your thoughts around that. Thank you.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, C. J. The company has made great progress over the last four years on margins. From a gross margin standpoint, the company has added about 1 point per year over that time period. If you looked at our operating margins, since 2013, we've added over 14 points to our operating margins. The company is performing and executing incredibly well. If we look at the way the company is compressing discretionary spend and funneling more resources to R&D, it's what's leading to the rapid organic growth that the company is delivering. Gary is incredibly focused, inflection-driven organic grower and we're going to continue to execute against that strategy. So company has made good progress historically, will continue to make progress. You'll see operating leverage in the model going forward, and we're going to be looking for additional opportunities to improve margins beyond the target model and beyond the guidance that we gave on both the gross margin and operating margin lines. And we'll deliver that to shareholders when we find those opportunities to execute on. So, we're really confident and we've done a great job historically and we'll continue to execute well.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah. One other thing, C. J., I would add, as Dan talked about on the call, we're off to a great start. So, if you look at the model we talked about just a couple of months ago, and the data that we provided in the call today, we're going to be well along the way towards that financial model for 2020. Certainly, we're not going to update anything this soon, but we're off to a really great start.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, C. J.
Operator: And your next question comes from Atif Malik from Citigroup.
Atif Malik - Citi Research: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on great results. Gary, if you can just qualitatively talk about what's driving the upside to the $90 billion number WFE that you shared at your Analyst Day, which end-markets are looking better? Is it the image sensors? Is it domestic China? And similarly, on the display side, is it TVs or is it more OLED that's driving higher than 30% year-over-year growth? Thank you.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Atif. This is Dan. Let me jump in. 2017 was a record year for the industry. At our Analyst Day, we said 2017, 2018 combined would be $90 billion. Gary, in his prepared comments, said several billion more than that, and we see the fundamentals into 2019 being strong as well. As we take a look at what's driving this level of activity, I'd put it into three buckets. First, demand drivers; second, capital intensity; third, our customers are very healthy. From a demand drivers standpoint, we're layering in additional layers of end-market demand, things like artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, big data, autonomous driving. We still have significant content gains to go in the handset and we're seeing significant demand for solid state drives. So, as we look across the industry, the demand drivers are multiple and broad-based. And as we take a look at how that translates to activity within our industry, each of the device types is showing strength. Capital intensity is up across the industry. In foundry, it's up 100% over the last handful of years. And in that same time period, NAND is up 60% and DRAM is up 40%. And customers, they're investing a lot, but they're making a lot of money. The level of investment, as a percentage of their profitability, EBITDA, is down over the last five years in memory, it's down 40%; in foundry and logic, it's down 50%. So, the ecosystem customers are healthy and will continue to invest and generate returns on that investment. As we look at the industry and where we're at, at the very highest level, I would say there is strong balance between foundry logic and memory, with maybe a slight weighting towards memory. And within memory, we see NAND about two-thirds of that market and DRAM about a third. In foundry logic, we see foundry about two-thirds and logic about one-third. And in 2018, we see that same or similar profile that we're seeing in 2017. So, we think that the upside is broad-based. We see NAND up, we see logic up, we see foundry strong, we see DRAM strong. So, we're pretty happy with the fundamentals through 2018 and into 2019.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah, I'll answer the question on display. Basically, two big drivers for display. One is TVs and the other is mobile OLED. In the large screen televisions, we have 13 factories that we're tracking that are Gen 10.5. And a data point for that is, if you're building 65-inch television with Gen 10.5, large panels, you can get eight TVs; if you're building then with Gen 8.5, you get three. So, as the consumers are going to larger screens, there is a compelling value proposition to move to Gen 10.5. So that's driving part of the market. And then of course, for smartphones, OLED is a big factor. And what we see through 2020 in mobile OLED, with the investment that's being made, you'll be able to build about 50%, right around 50% of smartphones with OLED screens in that timeframe. So those are the two drivers; large screen televisions and mobile OLEDs. The mix relative to revenue, 2017 is more weighted to mobile versus TV. The mix in 2018 is pretty balanced between TV and mobile. But, again, both cases, we see these as multiyear drivers for display. And as we mention in the prepared remarks, we have a long lead times for display, and we see display healthy 2018 and 2019. The other thing I'd mention about display is, it is unique for Applied Materials; in expanding our materials innovation into this market, the complexities increasing and it really has been a great growth driver for the company.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Atif.
Operator: And your next question comes from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, congratulations on the solid execution and the outlook. Last earnings call, you guys articulated a view that total DRAM capacity has been relatively flattish over the past five years. And looking into next year, DRAM bit demand looks actually quite strong, you guys articulated some of that on the call. And it would argue for some growth in the installed base capacity in 2018. I think you guys also said last call that it's looking like maybe 75k growth and 50k net add of capacity to the total installed base at DRAM. So I guess the question is, has that view changed? Because we've heard of some potentially new greenfield DRAM programs. And the point here is we just want to make sure that from your perspective, capacity growth outlook still looks relatively disciplined for this segment of WFE market?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Harlan. I think the short answer is yes, we still see a very disciplined market. We've got healthy customers, and the market is being demand-led. We see about 25% bit demand growth, and we see a very disciplined add of incremental bit capacity to match that bit demand growth. So, we see overall a very healthy market. We see the market being demand-led, customers are healthy, making money, so we're encouraged by what we see. I think the news this year for us, the interesting news, is we increasingly see in the memory market adoption of power and performance capabilities in the memory devices, and we see it in both DRAM and NAND, which means our leadership businesses, as I said my prepared comments, are showing strong growth into the memory market going forward, higher input/output feeds. And the logic periphery that sits around memory cells and DRAM are increasingly adopting logic-like power and performance capabilities. So, we're really encouraged by what we see in this market.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results. I had a question on your display margins. And I guess, this quarter, I was positively surprised by the huge up-tick in operating margins in the segment. So, I guess, the question is, what drove that? Was it something one-time or was it simply a function of revenue, or was there something more sustainable and fundamental behind the big up-tick? And going forward, how should we think about margins in display as you start to ramp your new products and as you expand your SAM? Thank you.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Toshiya. Yeah. So, I would look at the scale of the business getting larger, the continual improvements. We put out a target for this business of being high-20s, and that's what I would look to longer-term out of this business. I think you'll see it profiled differently into Q1 and get stronger throughout next year. But the way to think about this business is high-20s operating margin. We'll obviously look for opportunities to do better, but I think that's the right place to look at.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Toshiya.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on good results. I had a two-part question, I want to ask both upfront. One is, I think, Dan, you articulated the DRAM supply demand, wondering if you can articulate a similar one for NAND in 2018, if you think demand bit growth will exceed supply bit growth for NAND? And the second part question is that, I completely agree with you on the sustainability of WFE, but that question always comes up every now and then with investors. And if you believe 40-plus-billion or $45 billion is the new norm for WFE, why wouldn't you increase the dividend to reflect that so that it will put some of these questions to rest? Thank you.
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Krish. From the NAND supply demand standpoint, I think we see bit demand growing 40% in 2017, we see it higher into 2018. As you take a look at the capacity adds, today, we've got 1.6 million wafer starts per month of installed capacity, half of that is converted to 3D NAND. We still have half of that installed base to go to convert. And so, we see maybe 1.8 million to 2 million wafer starts per month in the 2020, 2021 timeframe. So that market looks demand-led and healthy as well. We see lot of room to go for solid-state drives. We are in the very early innings of penetration of solid-state drives. Handsets still have lots of content gains to go. As you take a look at the 3D roadmaps going forward, 48 layers, 64 layers, all the way up to 144 layers, the roadmap extends beyond several generations. And incremental NAND bit growth in the era of 3D NAND is more challenging. So, all of this comes together to give us confidence that we've got a balanced market, opportunity is there, and see demand in this market being fairly elastic. So, we feel really good about what we see. From a capital allocation dividend perspective, so this company has had a long history and tradition of returning excess cash to shareholders. In the last five years, it's been 82%. In the last three years, it's been 89%. And we're going to continue to return cash to shareholders. As you take a look at the tax structure and the proportion of cash that gets generated overseas versus onshore, there is a structural impediment to us being more aggressive from a dividend perspective in the near-term, but this is something that gets a lot of – we're spending a lot of time discussing this and we're watching tax policy out of Washington very closely. And when we get clarity on tax policy, then we'll be able to determine what the right long-term proportion of dividend versus share repurchase is, so that where we continue to return cash to shareholders in the most efficient optimal way possible to drive value for shareholders.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thank, Krish
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: And your next question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet: Yes, thanks. I just wanted to kind of piggyback on C. J's question about margins. Dan, you laid out what we felt was conservative gross margin expectations at the Analyst Meeting, 47% in 2020. And according to your plans for this year, it looks like you'll get pretty close, 46.6%. And you alluded on the call at least that you think over time, maybe you could do better. So, my question is really how high is the ceiling for gross margin?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Romit. I think we'll stand by our model that we put forward at our Analyst Day in 2020. We'll update that model at our next Analyst Day to the extent there will be new news. And in the meantime, the company is going to be hyper-focused on driving strong execution going forward, continuing to look for every opportunity we can to squeeze profitability out of this company and drive value for shareholders. We're off to a good start. If we were to take the current 2017 mix and apply it to the cost structure in 2017 – I mean, I'm sorry, the cost structure in 2020, the 47% target gross margin would be over 48%. So, the progress that we're making as a company, to some extent, will be masked as display and services outgrows our semi business. But we like having multiple drivers of growth. We like our breadth, and it just gives us more opportunities to impact this industry in a really positive way, creating value for shareholders.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Romit.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet: That's terrific. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. One very simple question on – from the level of CapEx that you're seeing currently in NAND and DRAM, what level of bit growth do you expect on the supply-side for next year?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: So, DRAM, we see about 25% bit growth from a supply perspective. And I would say about 40% to 45% from a NAND perspective.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. The WFE number keeps going up. And we were at 34 billion not that long ago. Now, you're talking about a number, it sounds like well north of 45 billion for next year. Is it the level where you start to think that we're going to level off or will decline, that – because it seems like the ceiling on supply isn't changing even though the WFE number is rising a lot. And is that – did you guys underestimate how expensive this would be to add that amount of capacity or just why you're so comfortable when you talk about this being sustainable out to 2019, when the WFE number has grown by so much?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. I think when we look at what makes the industry healthy where it is today, again, it's diversity of demand drivers, supporting macro trends that are going to unlock significant economic value. Capital intensity is up across the board, customers are investing. But again, they're healthy and profitable. And the industry never went to 450-millimeter wafers. And so for a variety of reasons, we feel very, very good about where we sit. Is there opportunity for upside of this levels, if I had to take an over/under on WFE, I'd say over right now. But it's probably premature to see that. And again, we see the market being demand-led. And when you take a look at things like bid output per dollar invested, that growth is slower. And so, it just accrues benefit to companies that are in our business, and Applied is better positioned than any to capitalize on it.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah, maybe let me add something on kind of where we're at. We went from PC enterprise – everybody has long memories of waiting for the operating system upgrades – to mobile and social media, pervasive demand, annual war every holiday season for all of the consumer electronics products. And now we're moving into this AI big data era. And many people talk about their opportunities to create trillions of dollars of economic value, transforming transportation, health care, many major industries. So if you look at what's happened over the last couple of years, the components of that are data generation, data storage and compute. So, data generation, you have all of these smart devices and sensors that are growing very fast. And over the last period of time here, you now have foundry, 40% of foundry spending is in the trailing geometries. And all of these smart devices are continuing to grow, and there's tremendous economic value that's created there. So that's one driver that wasn't there in the past. Then all of this data is going up at a very high rate. We showed at the Investor Meeting that memory shipments are tracking data generation, and as Dan talked about, memory has never been healthier in terms of overall profitability. There's a tremendous increase in data, capturing all of that information. And then to really transform those industries, trillions of dollars of economic value, you have to process the data. And at the Investor Meeting, we talked about oil powering the industrial revolution, data powering the AI, big data revolution. And so, again, you have the trailing geometries, you have the leading geometries and the war for the AI architectures on high-performance computing. You have drivers on the memory, the data storage and the cross-over for solid-state drives. So a number of different things that are new drivers. The other thing I would add, it's – some small incremental add is China. We talked about China being up in 2018 in the wafer fab equipment spending by about $2 billion. And what we see is that we believe that that investment will continue to go higher in China, not step function change, but incrementally higher going forward in the future. So, you have all of those drivers kind of underpinning where we're at right now. And certainly, we were able to talk about 2018 double-digit growth across all of our different businesses, because we have better visibility to customers and all of those drivers and all of their projects. So that also gives us increased confidence.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Joe.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Edwin Mok from Needham.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the service side of the business. You guys – obviously, you guys have done a great job, just grew 20% year-over-year. As we go through 2018, given that it's growing above what you guys have targeted, this 15% target you talked about. Is there a risk that since you signed all these big contract now that there may be a slower growth rate as we go through 2018? And you mentioned that you have 25% increase in service contract, is there a way to kind of think about how much of your installed base is in service contract versus how much more room you can grow?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: So, I think over the last several years, we've been growing service contracts net over 1,000 (48:47) per year. And as we talked about, the revenue opportunity for us is dramatically higher when we have the service contracts versus no service contracts. So there was a big change in strategy around 2013. And since then, the service contract growth has been pretty significant. So, if you look at what's happening with customers, they're ramping many of these new devices. 3D NAND going to 64 layers and 96 layers, and in the future, they'll be ramping 1Z (49:21) DRAM and 7-nanometer in foundry and logic. These technology nodes are very difficult. And we've reorganized service, so we're focused on being able to support our customers in accelerating yield, output and cost. And we have tremendous traction for customers. It's worth a lot of money for them to optimize those big investments they're making in their fabs. We've made changes within the organization, so that we're accelerating those new service products and we have very high confidence that we're going to continue to drive the service around a 15% rate. In the last year, as we mentioned, it's been faster than that. But the number that we discussed at the Investor Meeting, we still have high confidence in is around 15% in terms of the compound annual growth rate.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Edwin.
Operator: And your next question comes from Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe for Gary, in terms of your positioning, you talked about in the past that share gains you made in areas like etch, process control, and you gave some more color today about areas like patterning. As we look at 2018, and especially with China growing as a percentage of WFE spending, how do you see those share gains moving forward, say, in both 2018 and maybe over the next few years?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thank you, Patrick. So, if you look – if you include this year, over the last six years, we've gained share five out of the last six years and we were flat one year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we are anticipating double-digit – strong double-digit growth in both our leadership and high-growth semiconductor businesses. So, pretty broad-based. We have very good momentum in memory. We've gained several points of market share in memory over the last several years. Dan talked about the significant growth that we've had, not only in the high-growth semi, but in the leadership products where we have extremely high market shares, we've grown in the last few years about $1.5 billion, I think is the number, in additional revenue growth. And we see, as Dan talked about, in memory, moving to more logic-like structure. So, all of those leadership products where we have very, very high share in foundry and logic, we're growing significantly our share in memory also. So, that gives us a one driver. In patterning, we also have gained significant share over the last five years. We've gained about 19 points of share in patterning. And what we showed at the Investor Meeting was another $1 billion growth over the next four years in patterning. And we have, again, tremendous momentum there. In foundry, as this war for AI leadership is happening, we are creating the materials that enable power and performance. It's a very unique position. And that is leveraging all of our leadership businesses, all of those areas where we have externally high share. The power and performance for high-performance computing is coming from Applied Materials. And in China, we talked about $2 billion in growth in China. We have very high share in China. We will outgrow that market growth. It's going to be a fair amount of growth. I don't want to give a specific number, but it's a significant amount of growth for us in China in 2018. And then the last thing I would say that we're really driving that a bigger emphasis in the company is around connectivity. It's worth a lot of money, it's worth a lot money for our customers to accelerate a new device to market. If you can bring a winning AI chip to market six months or 12 months faster, that's worth a lot of money. So, we are creating the materials that enable power and performance. We have innovative technologies and modifying materials, we're moving materials and analyzing materials. We recently made a change in the organization to better drive speed of innovation and especially connectivity across the company. We have very strong pull from our leading customers across the board, real strong pull on new materials, new innovative materials. And we're the only place where you can work all of that at the same time. So, this focus on connectivity is stronger than we've ever had at Applied, and the pull from customers for connectivity is also very strong. Again, if I can accelerate a chip to market by 12 months, it's worth a tremendous amount of money. We've put a tremendous amount of talent into that organization and that's another driver in terms of our business going forward.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Tom Diffely from D. A. Davidson & Co.
Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.: You talked a little bit about the increase in OpEx sequentially. And first, I assume that's mainly just in the R&D line. And then what should we expect from a sequential increase in OpEx going forward?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: So, when we look at OpEx, again, the company's done a great job investing for growth. Almost all of the OpEx that you see, virtually all of it, is to support R&D programs that drive growth and continue to build out our field force, as we bring new innovative products to market, engage with our customers and drive the right kind of outcomes for the customers. So, it's clearly to support growth, new inflections and building up the field force to bring innovative products to market. As we think about the profile throughout the year, I think you could see, we're going to be up into Q2, and then a little bit into the back-half of the year and flat for the back-half of the year. So, you'll see that grow a little bit throughout the year.
Thomas Robert Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Tom. And operator, we have time for just two more questions, please.
Operator: Okay. And your next question comes from Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. I have a more near-term question, a few companies has suggested that the first half of next year, foundry will be slightly weaker. Do you agree with that? And if you look at the 7-nanometer ramp that those companies think will be as big as the 28-nanometer node, if this is being spread over say four years and we're halfway through that, does that mean the next two years, we're also looking at kind of flattish foundry spending, just trying to get some color around your comment that foundry spending will be strong next year?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Sidney. Again, as we look at 2017, shaping up to be a record year for this industry, as we look at how we are going to close out the calendar year, in November and December, we see significant strength in our business rounding out the calendar year. As we look at the slope throughout 2018, we're confident and encouraged by what we see strength throughout the year. And the fundamentals, again, look good into 2019. So, we feel really good about where we sit and how things are going to profile. From a foundry perspective, we do see the 7-nanometer node being on par with 28-nanometer. Our estimation, given the spend that we see on the lagging edge, is 28-nanometer is still going to grow. Initially, we thought it was going to land around 320,000 wafer starts per month. But we do see that growing. And when you combine that with 22-nanometer optical shrinks off of 28-nanometer, you're going to get something that tips over 400,000 wafer starts per month. And when you look at 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer, we see something that's going to be on par with what we just said. How it gets profiled, we think 7-nanometer is going to be large, and we also think 5-nanometer is going to be large as well. So when we look at foundry being strong on a go-forward basis, we really like what we see in terms of up-tick in demand and the diversification of those demand drivers.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Sidney.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And your last question comes from Craig Ellis from B. Riley FBR.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on very strong execution. Gary, I wanted to go back to some of your comments both in the prepared remarks and in some of the questions around AI. This week an industry event NVIDIA's CEO said that, up to 70% of all data center workloads could be AI-enabled. And so the question is, as you're talking to your customers about the pressure this is putting on their capital investment, are you hearing that this is a gradual force through 10-, 7- and 5-nanometer, or did they see a step function coming at any one of those nodes or more of an investment in either logic or memory, where there are diversified suppliers? Thank you.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the question. And again, what we're seeing is, if you look at the data generation, already, we see a big impact in terms of wafer fab equipment spending in sensors, in those trailing-edge geometries, smart everything. We see about 40% of foundry spending coming from those sources, and we think that's going to continue. And then the increase in data, again, you have to capture the data before you can process it and create the value, we're certainly seeing tremendous increase in data that's driving a healthier memory business than we've ever seen. And for the high-performance computing, the key thing about Applied Materials is that we create the materials that enable high-performance computing. Our leadership business, if you look at EPI and PVD and implant and the advanced annealing processes, all of those areas we have very, very high market share. So, the pull that we have with customers is tremendous. The visibility that we have around those structures for 7-nanometers, for 5-nanometers is very unique in that we have that's we are creating those materials. So the pull for us is very, very strong. And the architecture war that's happening in AI isn't over. There is a lot of companies that are designing specific AI chips for different kinds of applications. So there's a tremendous amount of activity there. And we think that that will ramp a significant amount over time.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks. Craig. And Dan, would like to add anything in closing?
Daniel Durn - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks Mike. If I could – I want to say that this is incredible exciting time for me, our company and the industry as a whole. Applied is a unique position and our breadth sets us apart. It allows us to drive the most inflections and it generate the most growth opportunities. The company is executing extremely well. We're delivering record performance. But we're not going to be satisfied. We're not going to rest on what we did last quarter or last year. We're going to be relentlessly focused at driving execution. We're going to continue to make smart R&D investments to drive our organic growth. We're going to continuously improve our operations. We're going to look for more ways to increase gross margins, deliver more value to our shareholders and we're going to continually drive spend discipline throughout all levels of this company. This execution is delivering great momentum for us. We're ending the year with record backlog and record orders in the year. We're going to expect double-digit growth across all of our businesses going into 2018. Personally, I look forward to seeing many of you, Credit Suisse, in a week-and-a-half, at CES to start the New Year. And I guess, lastly, for those of you who call Boston home, please make sure you give a warm Boston welcome to our friends from the Golden State when they rolled into town tonight for what is going to be an amazing game. With that, I wanted to thank you for joining us today and giving us your support. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Dan. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of our call is going to be available on our website by 5:00 PM Pacific Time. And we'd like to thank everybody for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. With revenue and profits at all-time highs, I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials has now delivered earnings records for the past 5 quarters. We have tremendous momentum and a very positive outlook for the future. Our markets are growing with a broader set of demand drivers. Across a wide variety of industries, companies are making huge investment to drive transformative changes that shift economic value towards technology. At the very foundation of these emerging trends is Applied. And we are playing a larger and more valuable role advancing the innovation road maps in semiconductor and display. Our broad portfolio of technologies and businesses, combined with our strategy and investments, means that Applied has never been in a better position. This gives me confidence that we will continue to expand our available opportunity, gain share and outperform our markets.  In today's call, I'll outline key industry trends as well as our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth. I'll then provide additional details about our markets and major businesses. Bob will then discuss how we're translating our broad portfolio of capabilities and products into differentiated performance for Applied. And after that, Dan will provide his initial impressions about our future opportunities as well as our outlook for the next quarter.  I'll start with the backdrop for today's discussion. These are incredibly exciting times for Applied, and I strongly believe that we have more opportunities today than at any point in our history. There are 3 main reasons for this. First, our markets are strong and getting stronger. Pervasive demand for electronics means that our markets are getting larger and substantially less cyclical. New demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility. The Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence will transform industries over the coming years. In health care, transportation, manufacturing and retail, competition is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data and images. In these industries and many more, value is shifting towards semiconductors and displays. To realize the potential of IoT, Big Data and AI, major technology inflections are needed to advance the road maps in logic, memory and display. These inflections are enabled by materials innovation, and as the leader in materials engineering, Applied has a fundamental role to play. Second, Applied is better positioned than ever before. We've aligned the company around our innovation leadership strategy, and we've made significant investments to accelerate R&D. We have developed a strong portfolio of differentiated products, with more in the pipeline. It's the company's breadth and depth of products and capabilities that sets us apart from the competition. We have, by far, the largest exposure to industry inflections, and we're combining our skill sets in deposition, removal, materials modification, inspection and metrology to deliver innovative, new solutions. Third, we built a platform that gives us sustainable advantages over the long term. We've done this by strengthening our technical and management teams and putting in place a company-wide operating system, the product the management engine, that delivers repeatable success. Across the organization, I see stronger execution. Our product success rate is higher, we are transferring new technology to market faster and we're using our breadth more effectively.  I'll now describe the major inflections and investments within our markets. In memory, near-term market fundamentals remain strong, driven by high-performance storage for data centers and increasing smartphone content to support new features, including 3D cameras. We expect healthy investment in memory to continue as the explosion of data storage requirements created by IoT, Big Data, AI and streaming video has only just begun. To keep up with demand, customers are aggressively pursuing their 3D NAND scaling road map, which has 4 major levers: increasing number of pairs, shrinking film and stack heights, multi-tier schemes and lateral scaling. All these approaches are enabled by advanced materials engineering and expand Applied's opportunity.  In foundry, market dynamics are equally healthy. In the near term, we see capacity additions at trailing geometries to meet growing demand for sensors and IoT devices as well as strong investment in the leading edge. Looking ahead, advances in Artificial Intelligence are beginning to drive significant architectural changes, and customers are positioning themselves to win the major inflections in high-performance computing. In data centers designed for AI workloads, we see logic content growing at least twice as fast as memory. And as technology complexity increases, capital intensity is also growing about twice the rate of memory.  In foundry logic and DRAM, dimensional scaling of devices remains a challenge, with 2 primary areas of focus: resolution and placement accuracy. New innovations in patterning are becoming increasingly important as customers move to advanced nodes. First, self-aligned multi-patterning techniques, SADP and SAQP, are needed in conjunction with EUV lithography to drive the resolution road map. Regardless of the rate of EUV adoption, we expect our opportunity in traditional multi-patterning to grow. Applied has great momentum in this market and has gained 16 points of shares since 2012. Second, new patterning approaches are being developed to address placement errors. As devices scale, the accuracy of vertical alignment between interconnect layers has a significant impact on performance and reliability. Placement errors cannot be addressed by advanced lithography alone and will require materials-enabled solutions. Applied has unique technology in this area, and we expect our opportunities to grow significantly over the next several nodes.  Looking at the market as a whole, our outlook is incrementally more positive. We now believe that wafer fab equipment spending for the calendar year will be up 20% or more compared to 2016. We also expect 2018 spending to be higher than our current estimate for 2017. And in these forecasts, we made conservative estimates for spending in China. In addition, within wafer fab equipment, the ongoing shift to materials-enabled solutions in memory and logic opens up new opportunities for Applied. We now address 64% of the total market compared to 53% in 2012. Beyond semiconductor, our outlook for the display market has also strengthened. Display is growing even faster than wafer fab equipment as customers make multi-year investments to address large inflections in both TV and mobile. In TV, a major push to new Gen 10.5 substrates is other way. These huge, 10 square meters substrates are ideally suited for manufacturing larger format screens, 60 inches and bigger. We now expect [30] new Gen 10.5 factories to be built over the next several years. At the same time, mobile OLED investment is getting stronger as customers prepare for broad adoption of OLED in smartphones. oLED enables new form factors that result in a larger display area for smartphone, further expanding the overall market.  I'll now provide brief updates for our major business groups. Our semiconductor leadership businesses, where we have strong market share and highly differentiated products, are having an outstanding year, fueled by investment in leading-edge foundry and expanding applications in memory. Demand for our PVD and CMP products is especially strong. We expect the PVD market to grow by around 45% in 2017 as foundry customers adopt new interconnect technology. And the CMP market is on track to grow 40% this year on top of 40% growth in 2016. Our CMP revenues were at an all-time high this quarter and on track to exceed $1 billion for the fiscal year. In our semiconductor growth businesses, we have great momentum in markets that are growing rapidly. Over the past several years, we have gained significant market share in both etch and CVD. Our combined etch and CVD revenues are at record levels, and we're in a great position to drive further growth.  Service is an important part of Applied's portfolio that has grown significantly. This year, we're seeing acceleration of that growth. We delivered record performance this quarter, and for the year, we expect revenues to be up more than 15% over 2016. Demand for our Service Solutions is driven by our rapidly growing installed base, plus our customers' need to shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield and rapidly optimize their factory output and operating costs. We are investing to expand the services we offer, and we are confident in our ability to sustain our growth in this business. In display, as technologies and manufacturing are becoming more complex, Applied is in a unique position to enable the road map. This year, display revenues are on track to increase more than 50% over 2016, and based on our strong position, we expect to grow display at least another 30% in 2018.  Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'll quickly summarize. Applied is executing well, setting new records, growing our available market and gaining market share. I would like to thank our employees for their passion to create value for customers and Applied. I'm confident that together, we will raise the bar further. Applied is in a great position, working at the sweet spot of major trends that will drive tremendous shifts in economic value over the coming years. Finally, our breadth and depth differentiate us from our competitors. We have wider exposure to major industry inflections, and we are bringing together the broadest skill sets and technology portfolio to create new solutions for our customers and accelerate innovation.  Now let me hand the call over to Bob.
Robert Halliday: Thanks, Gary. Today, I'll add my comments about the business environment, describe how our capabilities and products are driving competitive and financial performance and invite Dan to share his perspective, along with our Q4 guidance.  As you contemplate the markets, including record levels of demand for semiconductors and displays, I'd like you to note 3 things. First, I feel increasingly confident that our markets are becoming materially and sustainably larger. Gary explained the big picture, and I'll add some data regarding the near-term environment.  In semiconductor, 2/3 of NAND demand is driven by smartphones and SSDs. NAND demand for these devices is projected to grow by more than 40% in 2017 and 2018. Smartphones and service drive the majority of the DRAM market. And demand from these devices should be up by 30% or more in both 2017 and 2018. In foundry, our largest customer recently announced that its 7-nanometer tape-out expectations have nearly doubled. And we continue to see new investment at trailing geometries as well. So the largest drivers of WFP demand are strong.  In display, OLED is quickly becoming the preferred technology for leading brands. Yet, the installed capacity supports less than 40% of the smartphone market. An increasing technical complexity in semi and display gives us a growing opportunity in services. In short, I expect sustainable growth for our markets and particularly for Applied.  Second, Applied is uniquely well positioned in this improving environment, and we're driving growth and competitive performance across our markets. Applied has incredible breadth. And we're taking advantage of it across our semi and display businesses to help our customers solve their highest-value problems, with solutions based on unique combinations of our technologies. The investments we've made in our new product pipeline are already impacting the market. In 2017, we're delivering strong, double-digit revenue growth in every semiconductor device type. We project our share to be up for the sixth year in a row. And our share is balanced at greater than 22% across memory, logic and foundry.  In patterning, we see continued growth and share gains because we're shipping newly designed products that address both line shrinks and edge placement errors. We've also put our services business on a growth trajectory, adding $1 billion in annualized revenues since 2013. And we built a unique and more diverse growth engine in display. In 2012 and 2013, our annual display revenue averaged $657 million. We expect to deliver a similar amount in the current quarter. Our display business is also becoming more profitable, and we're now targeting operating margins in the high 20s. So Applied has the broadest capability, largest served market opportunity and strongest new product pipeline of any company in the industry.  Third, and perhaps best of all, Applied's innovation engine and operating discipline are driving higher profitability. The value that our technology brings to the industry is increasing, and that's reflected in our gross margin, which has grown by 5 points over the past 5 years. In Q3, our gross margin was the highest in 9 years. At the same time, we remain focused on expense control. In Q3, our non-GAAP OpEx-to-sales ratio was 17.9%, a record low. As a result, we delivered our first quarter with $1 billion in operating profit, and we had record cash from operations equal to 36% of revenue.  Next, I'll comment on our Q3 performance on a year-over-year basis. We grew company revenue by 33% and non-GAAP gross margin by 2.9 points. We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 67% and increased non-GAAP operating margins by 5.9 points to a 16-year high of 28.7%. And we grew non-GAAP EPS by 72% to a record of $0.86 per share.  Turning to the balance sheet. We grew cash and investments to $8.3 billion, and 40% was onshore. We repurchased 9 million shares of our stock and returned $482 million to shareholders, including dividends.  Turning now to our segment performance on a year-over-year basis. We grew semiconductor systems revenue by 42% to a record $2.5 billion and grew non-GAAP property profit dollars to a record of $920 million. We grew services revenue by 20% to a record $786 million and increased non-GAAP operating profit dollars to a record of $215 million. We grew display revenue by 31% and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 2.6 points.  In summary, I'm proud of the accomplishments of our teams, and I'm pleased with our top and bottom line growth. Applied's innovation engine is delivering sustainable momentum our profitable growth.  Now I'll hand the call over to Dan.
Daniel Durn: Thanks, Bob and Gary and the entire team here at Applied Materials. You've given me a warm welcome and a great introduction to the technologies we're preparing to launch into a growing market for our products. I'm incredibly impressed by the depth of our technical talent. Applied has a world-class team, and I believe we can do anything we set our minds to.  Gary and Bob talked about new advances in technology that are going to make dramatic change to our industries and to our lives. I saw this unfolding at my previous companies, and I'm excited to be here because these changes are enabled by semiconductors and displays, which begin with what we do at Applied Materials. I'll share more of my impressions about Applied at our Analyst Day in New York.  One thing that's already clear to me as a financial person is that Applied has a tremendous portfolio. The leadership semi business, as Gary talked about, has some of the strongest product positions and profitability I've seen anywhere in this industry. The semiconductor growth businesses, as Gary mentioned, are dramatically outpacing their markets. Etch is up 5x over the past 5 years, growing at 2.5x the rate of the market, and that's just one example. Display is growing faster than semi, and we have technologies in the pipeline that will enable us to grow beyond what we can do in OLED smartphones and LCD TVs. And services are a great way to drive growth and diversify the company in areas that are particularly stable and cash-generative. Applied's portfolio is incredibly valuable. I'm excited to be a part of this team, and I'll use all of my energy to help drive Applied's innovation engine and growth.  Now I'll provide our fourth quarter guidance. In Q4, we expect our overall revenue to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $4 billion. The midpoint would be up nearly 19% year-over-year. We expect our semiconductor systems revenue to increase by about 14% year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow about 17% year-over-year, and display revenue should be up by about 48% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin of about 46%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $685 million, plus or minus $10 million. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.94, the midpoint of which would be up by 36% year-over-year.  To help you with your models for the calendar year, I'll share some of our early views on Q1 of fiscal 2018. We believe semiconductor systems revenue in Q1 is likely to be higher sequentially and higher year-over-year, and we believe our display revenue in Q1 is likely to be lower sequentially but higher year-over-year.  Now I'll summarize by putting the company's guidance and momentum into context. In Q4, we expect the second highest semiconductor equipment revenue in our history, with continued double-digit growth momentum year-over-year. We also expect to set new record levels in services, display and for the company as a whole. We expect record earnings per share. We also look forward to another year of growth in 2018 based on strong customer pool across the portfolio as we supply our enabling technologies to drive the new data economy. I look forward to sharing our longer-term financial targets at the Analyst Day in New York September 27 and especially look forward to meeting many of you there.  Now let me turn the call back to Mike to start the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.
Christopher Muse: I guess, biggest question here is sustainability in memory. And it looks like you're guiding [indiscernible] around $43 billion plus or minus this year. And roughly 70% of that looks like it's coming from NAND. And so curious, as you look at that part of the market, can you talk to your visibility to both greenfield and shrink plants as well as your thoughts around demand elasticity and how you're thinking about spend from that business over the next 5-plus years?
Gary Dickerson: Sure, I'll take a shot. Overall, we expect WFE in '18 -- I'll drill into the memory, too. We expect overall WFE in '18 to be up from '17. By device type, we think logic and DRAM should be higher next year. And we think foundry and NAND should both be strong next year. I think the 70% of total spend, the NAND, I thought you said, C.J., sounds a little high because we have NAND at less than 50% of total spend. But I'll drill into a bit deeper dive on what's going on in the memory markets. So let me talk about DRAM and NAND together, and I'll drill into NAND also. I think there's 3 important disturbance customers what about Applied in both NAND and DRAM. One, if you look at NAND rum customers, very profitable now, and I'll give you the numbers. Two, second thing to remember is demand is strong for both DRAM and NAND. Looks sustainable. The third thing is, actually, wafer starts additions have been modest, and I'll give you the numbers.  And finally, think about the member that Applied Materials we've gained 8 points of WFE share in both DRAM and NAND over the last 4 years. So let me give you more specifics. In terms of customer profitability, which was the first talking point I made, DRAM WFE spending as a percentage of total EBITDA for our customers used to be about 26% on average. That's DRAM WFE spending, the total EBITDA. And we think that's going to go down about half, 14% this year and next. You know they're very profitable. When you look at the numbers, it's very profitable. The NAND similarly has gone down. Used to be about 26%. We did about 1/3 this year or next to 19%. But that's also sustaining more higher growth rates in NAND, okay? The second thing to remember is bit demand. So if you look for smartphones and servers in both 2017 and '18, we see 30% bit growth demand.  Now it goes down a point or 2 when you layer in PCs and start, but the big drivers are smartphones and service, and we see 30% bit growth demand or gigabytes. Second, and NAND bit demand, we see 40% growth rate in '17 and '18 each for smartphones and [indiscernible]. Then on capacity additions, if you look at the data over the last, basically, 5 years, and we see this year basically the same, NAND DRAM wafer capacity has been basically flat. They got some bit growth but because of their more layers, the actual wafers out of the building kind of goes down. So it's kind of flat, not a lot of capacity added. Then if you look at NAND capacity additions, you spend at the money but actually give as the visions have been somewhat modest, a couple of hundred thousand wafers up to 1.6 now. And we project that we need about 2 billion [indiscernible] years, 2 million, [indiscernible] wafer starts, 2 billion a couple of years after that. But if you look at the 3 big things, customers are very profitable in both DRAM and NAND.  Secondly, bit growth and bit demand. Bit demand is still very healthy, and we see it next year, too. And three, actual wafer liver additions have been moderate. So we think I think NAND's pretty good for the foreseeable future.
Operator: The next button comes from Farhan Ahmad from Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad: Just quick clarifications. On the Jan quarter, do you think it will be a record level for SSD or not? And secondly, any color on the first half of next calendar year? Your commentary on 2018 seems to be fairly confident. Is it fair to say that the only things that you're seeing in 2018, they are looking pretty strong right now?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, it's strong. And we said in the call that Q1 was going to be a good fiscal quarter for us. So we said semi was going to be incrementally stronger than the comp. And display, not quite as strong as the comp in Q4 that we just guided to. So if you look at where we're close to reckon SSG this quarter, I think the record was last quarter, Q3. I think there's a pretty good chance that the record in Q1. Theres' a second question. Did you have a second part?
Farhan Ahmad: Yes, I was just -- calendar first year, is there any visibility that you have that makes you confident on the first half -- on the next year overall?
Gary Dickerson: What we said on the call, number one, was that we think next year, WFE is up. We also think our position's really good. And we have a strong degree of confidence in our fiscal Q1, and we don't see that problematic after that. We think it's a pretty good year.
Operator: The next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup.
Atif Malik: I just want to clarify the 30% year-over-year growth for display, is that for fiscal '18 or calendar '18?
Robert Halliday: Fiscal revenues. Calendar's good, too. I just don't a -- at that closer on the calendar basis.
Atif Malik: Okay. And can you help us out, how much of that is kind of market growth? I think, in the past, you've talked about an $18 billion display spending this year. Is that mostly market growth? Or are you baking in contributions from new products?
Robert Halliday: Yes. If you look at it in '17 and '18, our total revenues are going to be up in about 30%. If you go look at the market in '17, '18, it's going to be healthy. And our position's going to strengthen. And what the alluded to a little while ago that we're going to have some new product introductions. In fact, we already had 1 about a year or so ago. We're going to have more. So I think we'll get some contributions from the market and our position.
Operator: Your next button comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: You guys discussed the growing number of programs for large-screen LCD in your pipeline. A few weeks ago under earnings call, LG display discussed spending about KRW 20 trillion of bullet CapEx over the next 4 years. That's about USD 18 billion. And what actually for large-screen OLED? And I think the view is that OLED TV volume's going to grow from 2.5 million, 3 million next year to something like 6 million by 2020. Can you remind us on your position and large-screen OLED, your views on how you see the market evolving? Clearly, I think feel like it's been expect ever after mobile adoption.
Gary Dickerson: Sure. I'll give us some factoids on the overall market, which is touch on, Harlan, and a little bit on the OLED and then Gary might join on that one, too. So in terms of I do for you mentioned them, from our call, which, I think, was 3 months ago, our expectations for the total market of display equipment has gone up for all 5 years in our window, '17, '18, '19 and '20 and '21, all 5 have gone up. And we see strength across the board, basically, in both TV and mobile. A lot of big TV factories and increasing strength in mobile. So it's a very strong market position even more so than 3 months ago. In terms of our product positions, we're going to continue to traditional price. In terms of OLED TVs, kind of my stuff color filter I guess. So it's not the same OLED as you have in mobile, but it is a version of OLED. And our position is pretty good there. But it's not that big technology inflection, which is as much percentage growth in for everybody as you have some back in the mobile phones.
Gary Dickerson: We've been -- this is Gary. We've been increasing our share with pretty much all of the customers. And certainly, in this inflection also, we have an increasing position. So it's a very positive driver for us longer term. Relative to the inflections and kind of the market outlook, we're still in the early innings operating OLED mobile. So as that continues to get built out, that's a big positive driver for us. This adoption of larger screens in TV, we talked about the 13 Gen 10.5 factories, that will be built out over the next several years. And then if you look at the investments that large technology companies are making, VR, AR, automotive, those are -- there are other types of display technologies, portable displays, those other inflections that could be more significant if you look at it on the 3- to 5-year time frame. But we have good exposure to all of those changes.
Operator: Your next button comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar: I had a question on display. Something has been going on seeing the display CapEx is going to be down next year, but you guys are guiding to up 30% for revenue. And I understand you're getting some new products introductions. So a 2-part question. How much of the growth next year is driven by a new products versus the existing product line? And along the same path, can you split up of your revenue display revenue by LCD versus OLED for this year and next year?
Robert Halliday: Well, first, I'll do the market then I'll do a little bit on us. So with it of the total spending by display manufacturers is up this year and up again next year. We think it's pretty strong in both TV and mobile. So the big TVs are driving the CapEx spending on TV, and then mobile is mostly the OLED driver. So we see upside. In total, we see upside in TVs next year. And we also see some upside potential in mobile next year. And part of that is you see a proliferation to mobile phone display manufacturers beyond the big one in Korea. So if you think about the factoid we gave you over the last couple quarters, if you go back to our sales of OLED equipment in fiscal '16, roughly 2/3 was to the biggest manufacturer of OLEDs. We've now proliferated to 10 different people buying some equipment from us. And the big guy, in terms of commitments of orders this year, fiscal '17, is significant less than 50%. So what you're seeing is next year can grow because TVs are good, and you have a proliferation of more people making the mobile phones.
Operator: The next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Gary, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on your view on China into 2018. You talked about having relatively conservative assumptions embedded in your WFE forecast for 2018. But what exactly are those assumptions? And what would be the bulk case over the next 12 to 18 months?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks for the question. China is one of our strongest regions in both semiconductor display. Our business is growing a significant amount. If you look at '17 versus '15, we're up 2x in semi, 50% growth in service and 50% in display. In '16 to '17, we anticipate we're going to be up more than 20% overall in China. We track all the projects. We have very close relationships and very high share in China. So we're talking on the projects for all of the customers. And we have leading indicators for the most likely investments. There's a lot of discussion about investment, but we qualify that based on these leading indicators. And based on all of that, 2018, we think, will be up an incremental at least $1 billion, probably in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2018. Longer term, we think that this number is going to continue to grow because of the strategic nature of the investment. In China, they're trying to grow the present domestic content, build a secure supply chain and it's a long-term strategy. The investments are not as efficient. Many of the investments next year will be in pilot plants in China, but we believe that this market will continue to grow over time, and our position is very, very strong in both semiconductor and display.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: I want to ask about the growth in services. You talked about 15%, which is pretty good. I know you had a strategy operating kind of trying to move that opportunity. Can you talk about how you see is just because of the significant increase in the installed base tools versus some of the other things you might be doing to drive that growth?
Robert Halliday: Sure. If you look at it, you go back in a longer-term, historical perspective, we used to be kind of flat around $2 billion a year back around '13. This year, we're going to do about $3 billion. If you look at the rate of growth year-on-year, it's 15.9%. But if you look at the quarters of momentum picks up even throughout the year. So I'm pretty confident that the next year is a strong year for us, and probably the momentum is as strong, maybe a little better than this year for some reasons. One, if you look at your service business, it's a function of 2 things: the market, your position and your strategy to attack the market. 3 things, I guess. Market, product and session and strategy. So if you look at the market, WFE is pretty damn strong. It's a pretty big number this year and next year, so that provides a toolset that you can service. Then if you look at a percentage of the market for us, we used to be 17.8% of WFE just for [300-millimeter] tools back in 2013. And this year -- last year, we grew, what, 22, and we're going to go up again this year. So to the bigger piece of the market. Thirdly, if we would gain a lot of share a lot of share of literature in place of entitlement for service. So all the dynamics are on the market, our position, the products we're selling is raising our service settlement. And then secondly, what we have done -- or thirdly, that was market and our position, thirdly, in terms of our strategy is improved more and more. So if you look at it instead of seeing parts and ad hoc labor, we are selling long-term service contracts. We talked about getting 1,000 extra service contracts per year. And that means we have a more predictable, more sustainable and greater value for the customers and ourselves that again raises our service entitlement. So my guess, the rate of growth and service business continue pretty strong next year.
Operator: The next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.
Romit Shah: It seems like the DRAM industry is at a crossroads here, whereby with the conversion to 1x, bit supply growth is going to decelerate into the teens range. And that's well below what people are thinking in terms of DRAM bit demand, call it, 25%, 30%. So it would seem like next year, we do see capacity increase. And I know you guys are positive in that segment for 2018. And I was hoping you could just share your assumption for capacity additions in DRAM.
Robert Halliday: I'll give you my opening, and then Gary can jump in. So if you look at the dynamics, 3 of our 4 big memory customers do both DRAM and NAND. I personally believe there's slightly different strategies in DRAM and NAND. If you look at NAND, like to see demand for NAND is probably pretty damn big. There's a lot of growth in NAND than [indiscernible] hard disk drives. Then if you look at spend there and grow their market and make a bunch of money. If you look at DRAM, I don't think quite as big. So -- and then if you look at shrinking, you nominally get 28% more bits, roughly, per wafer, but because there's partners to get this wafers out of the same building basically more steps, and that's what it comes in sort of 14% growth in kind of output of our factory. So it's getting expensive to keep growing effective bits. So now what do you do? Well, if you have a total company strategy, you're probably going to invest heavily more heavily at a bit in greenfield NAND of visible marketing make money more heavily around conversions for DRAM. So what we see, our estimates is in 2017, you probably got about 75,000 wafer starts as in convert to 2.40 to 2.50. But the net adds is probably even a little less because it's like 50 or a little less because you kind of effectively shrinking your output that we could all those others because of more layer count. And we look at '18 similar numbers kind of 75 ads and convert 2 90 maybe. But it's more weighted to conversions than adds because of economics.
Operator: Your next button comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Looking at the foundry market, clearly, you're benefiting right now from capital intensity trends going to the 10- and 7-nanometer node. But could you just discuss maybe how that node may develop over time? And could you see that node being potentially as large as the 28-nanometer node, which has been very profitable for the chipmakers? Is it possible that this is the next big node that we see and this could be a multiyear event for the foundry segment?
Robert Halliday: I think the answer is yes, yes, and yes, more than one-word answer. So if you look at [indiscernible] 28 NAND, where I think peaked out at 335,000 wafer starts, earlier in the year, about 9 months ago, our estimate 7-nanometer would peak out, it's kind of 10 going to 7, 7 call it would peak out really quickly said 2 50 then 2 60 -- then 2 80. We're currently at 300,000 wafer starts. Might the upside to that because what you get more and more applications for 7-nanometer devices. There's going to be all the typical process mobilephone stuff what they're going to get more and more into this cloud they're going to the cars probably 7-nanometer device. So probably go long and big, right? Sort of like 20-nanometer. Now the good news much of goodness 1 is big that's obvious. Two, it's kind of long. So then you start to roll 4, and you say, "Hey, there's a lot of this roll to 5 stay at 7 of the product lines big now you stay at the Node 4 a while. So additionally as much guess down to 5, right? The third thing, which is really interesting is if you look at capital intensity picking up from 28 to 7, you'd say, "Well, okay, Bob, it's 3 35 to 300. You're down 10%." Capital intensity from 28 to 7-nanometer nodes is up over 90%. So to make those wafers, a lot more equipment sales and to our position's really good them is not to be a bunch of equipment sold it comes money big long note.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok from Needham.
Edwin Mok: Just quickly on margin, two-part question. One, revenue said just marginally coming down actually the lower.
Robert Halliday: Edwin, could you repeat the question, please? I just couldn't hear it clearly.
Edwin Mok: Sure, no problem. So I guess, 2-part question on margin. First is service margin, I noticed it came down this quarter. Wondering what what's irreverent that? And then display, with the revenue increase in this quarter and you guys guiding for higher revenue, is it possible to display get to the city marginal level sometime in the future?
Robert Halliday: Okay. So first, I'll do service margins. Yes, operating margins. So there's the trendline, and they can pull up service that they get the data here. Q3, Q4. Yes. I think service growth and operating margins are up a little bit in Q3 and up more in Q4, actually. And our trendline is they're going to go up. So I think what you'll see, I'll give you some longer-term perspective and where we're going on that might help. We used to be 23%, 24% operating margins in service. And then in full year '16, we're probably 26.5 or 7. This year, the guide is like 28%, frankly, and we're going to trend up a little bit more. So our optima did end up gross margin trending up some, too. So I think generally, the trends but a good what's driving the trendline and margins? Revenue gross but it on good. Gross margins are coming up, and you got dropped to us to get the percentage gross margin and you get the leverage of the revenue growth. So I think operating margin's going to trend up in gross margins trend up as well.
Gary Dickerson: One other thing I would add in terms of service is we've really done a great job in driving lower cost. We're moving a lot more content into lower cost regions. And customers are also facing big challenges in the technology ramps for logic and also for memory. Our opportunity, Bob talked about earlier, in service contract is also increasing our revenue growth. So we're driving lower costs. We're driving greater value for customers. And that is increasing our overall operating margins and giving us momentum going forward in service business.
Robert Halliday: So then display. Display Edwin also operative margins and gross margins trending up. If you look at operating margins for display, from 2012, they're about 9.8%. '13 was 16 8. '14 is 24. About 25 in '15. '16 was about 20, 21, we're investing. This year will be about 26%. Next year should be up with the volume. So I think we're going to do pretty well in display. And now if you look at the longer-term model, which will show an Analyst Day, last year unless they model we showed that generally, our operating margins and gross margins are higher in semi, but services and display are both -- they're all increasing. And what you probably get is high 20s in service and display and higher 30-somethings in semi, and overall average goes up.
Operator: Your next question comes from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc capital parts.
Weston Twigg: I just wanted to dig back into the visibility habits are large memory customers. And the reason I ask is just 6 to 9 months ago, your outlook for the year was substantially different. And so it implies very low visibility at some of these large customers. I'm wondering if that visibility has actually improved or you're really commenting on the trends are you're looking into 2018?
Robert Halliday: That's a heck of a good question. So I'll give you some historical perspective. We do forecast historically, based on -- we talk to the account guys with of the marketing guys, look at trend data and underlying drivers. When we do a kind of a 1-year forecast, it's a little bit more weighted to the start account guys. And the customers communication of second-half visibility to us is moderate. Sometimes they don't know, and sometimes they don't want to disclose it, frankly because it's a competitive issue for them. So my belief is that the semicap industry probably underestimated the second half of this year. And if we'd done a lot more deep thinking on it, we might have estimated at a little higher number than the second half. And it is one particular customer much bigger than expectations. So if you go we spent me percent and included been a lot more time on root cause drivers, what not just what customers tell us, but what are they selling, what are you device go into what is the content of the phone, what is the content of the PC, what's the content of the cloud? So, for instance, if you look at the from, what we thought ended '16 was content, wasn't unit phones it's content of the phones, content of the cloud. That is continuing for this year. And if you say, what device type is up this year from early expectations? Across the board, but it's NAND, DRAM and foundry, but NAND probably the biggest increase one particular customer. So we're spending a lot more time going to root cause drivers of what's driving the NAND. So i probably have more confidence than I did a year ago about the outlook.
Operator: Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
Craig Ellis: I'm going to ask you to take another longer-term view on the end user is as you did with foundry, DRAM. And what I was hoping you could you do is just click out beyond the next few shrinks that we're likely to get to some of the alternative architectures. And the question is really around the equipment intensity that might be seeing with any of the successor architectures that would be there for DRAM. Is it higher? Is it lower? Is it a mix? What's the company seeing longer term for the extension to nonvolatile memory as we know it or volatile memory as we know it?
Robert Halliday: I'll start with more general stuff, and Gary will do the more technical stuff. I generally am optimistic about the industry and the various device types, but there's going to be granularity to some of that. So I believe that these drivers that this greater and greater valuable applications for silicon at the need to be basically, A, leverage on the fiscal assets and universe more efficiently through silicon. And two, I think a lot of the incremental consumption of entertainment meets health care will be leveraged by silicon. So I think the cosmic drivers, whether it's on automobiles, hotels, health care, you name it, silicon's going to play a big role in this. Okay? So that drivers now that said, how to make money in life is 2 ways: scale and differentiation. So if you look at the scale of these things be a big increase scale up at the cloud with huge volumes. And the differentiations of these solutions what does that mean? I think you're going to have more different tape out some are different type of devices and you have before. I think you'll see the A6 chips. You'll see the graphics processor units at the guilty different types of high end, low end, different types of DRAM. And I think you'll see different types of memory. So I think the proliferation, more devices and more design, which is all good for us, frankly. And NAND, if you go to, but I think about altered memory? I think NAND is going to grow for a while. Hard disk drive. I think DRAM and memory was that segment the market the products because of volume of the differentiator so valuable that you can go to different design times. I don't think it's going to be one shoe fits all feat. And then thirdly, in terms of capital intensity, capital intensity by device type is up across the board from a few years ago, 30% to 90%, right? And I don't see that trend changing for all new devices either.
Gary Dickerson: So I would also agree with Bob that the -- you got big investments being made by leading companies to drive transformative changes that shift economic value in major industries. That's going to create a great opportunity for memory, for high-performance computing, all of those different areas. I also -- if you look at what's happened in memory over the last few years and what's driving the market today, tremendous innovation in architecture, driven by materials innovation, what we do better than anyone else. And we're working with very large companies on, certainly, extending current memory technologies, scaling 3D NAND. But we're also working on new memory technologies. And I really believe that the pace of innovation is going to accelerate. And really, at the foundation of that is Applied Materials with materials innovation. So I'm pretty optimistic on the overall market opportunity, and I'm also even more optimistic about our position to grow as these changes happen.
Operator: And next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Summit Redstone Partners.
Jagadish Iyer: Gary, you talked about Gen 10 fabs in the display side. So I was wondering how is it often to be OLED. And as a bigger picture, is this large-scale transformation to OLED happens, are you going to see a new baseline to your display revenues?
Gary Dickerson: So the Gen 10.5 factories are really focused on TV and all of the [13] projects that we're tracking right now are not OLED factories. They're, again, large area. We're seeing an increase in terms of the area consumption for large screens. And it's way more efficient to go to these larger factories from a cost perspective. So that's what's driving that. I mean, certainly, we're certainly very optimistic about mobile OLED and the opportunities that we have there. We're still in the early innings. But the driver for Gen 10.5 is larger TV screens. Bob, if you want to add anything else?
Robert Halliday: Yes, I think that's true. I do think there's a hell of a lot the upper directional errors in general for the market. And so the new baseline revenue is increasing for display, which is one particular question, Jagdish. And if you look at the inflections, there's just as bigger TV I mind not just OLED a little those are really other infectious like simple phone you have now is you go to the wraparound to get up at the bottom of the you get 40% more surface area we sell service area whether it's layers are size. And I think you're going to have foldable in a few years, which doubles that service area over the phone or an iPod, I guess. And then eventually you going to have some OLED proliferation, as you mentioned, the [indiscernible] we're something further down the road. All of these lead to more spending now the question people would ask a year or 2 ago is, geewhiz historically, you might have $32 billion in WFE spending and $8 billion and display spending and shouldn't stay at 25%? No. Because the drivers are very different. I mean, display as you huge application across the world and TVs, mobile phones, everyone has and the layer account to increase in their visual content of that is doubling. So I think there potential is pretty big.
Operator: The next question comes from Toshi Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I had a question on gross margin heading into next fiscal year. Bob, you talked about display growing 30% year-over-year. I'm guessing, at least at this point, you don't have as high expeditions for the semiconductor business. Did you thank you can improve gross margins in the next fiscal year?
Robert Halliday: Our goal is to increase gross margins every year. I think this year we've done particularly well and going to be up a couple of points, almost 3. We're going to be up like 2.9 this year or something like that. We're up a lot, okay? And no that's a lot of things. I mean, I think we've executed [5] product across the line. So if you look at our gross margin, every single product and the company, every be even the company, which number between service and semi, like 13 businesses, every one of the gross margins is up from '13 to '17. So good execution. Mix this year is pretty good. It's a good semi pretty big display and services here. So my take there's an opportunity to grow up next year, but we haven't from the models. But it would be hard to do it as well as you do this year. So my average goal at the end is done through the numbers past average goal kind of [7x] of a point a year. And if we do anything like that, we're already kind of ahead of me '19 model. So I think there's still room.
Daniel Durn: Sure Mica cutting is probably good. Summarize a few key points from today's call. First, I hope you share excitement that Applied's markets are substantially larger and more attractive than they've been historically. We expect another record quarter in Q4. With that line of sight, the continued momentum in Q1 and far beyond. Second, Applied is uniquely positioned to outperform our core market, further building on our leadership in semis, growing the unique opportunity we have in front of us in display and expanding the service businesses. Last -- third, we're more profitable than we've been, and we have many levers to keep driving the profitable growth. And lastly, I look forward to meeting all of you in your current Analyst Day on the 27th. And personally, I can't wait to show you how we can to get raising the ceiling on our performance in the years to come. Mike, now back to you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Dan. We would like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call is going to be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. And thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. I'm very happy to report another record-breaking quarter for Applied Materials with the highest revenue and earnings in our history. We've now set earnings records for 4 quarters in a row and as I look across the company, I see tremendous momentum. Our markets are strong and getting stronger and we're sustainably growing faster than these markets by expanding our served opportunity and gaining share. In today's call, I will provide our perspective on the factors driving the industry and our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth within this environment. I will then describe the key inflections and investments within our markets before concluding with updates on our major businesses. Bob will then provide additional detail about our performance and outlook. Let me start with the big picture. This is an incredibly exciting period for the electronics industry, with a broader set of drivers and a wider spectrum of companies making very large investments to advance semiconductor and display technology. In the past, PCs were the dominant factor in semiconductor demand. PCs drove the technology road map and enterprise refresh cycles drove industry upturns and downturns. More recently, global adoption of smartphones, combined with social media, have created a much more pervasive consumer demand, expanding the market and making it substantially less cyclical. Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. The impact for Applied is twofold. First, our markets are growing and becoming more stable. Second, this is a period of incredible innovation in logic, memory and display and we're in a great position to provide the critical building blocks needed to move the industry forward. At Applied, our strategy is to be the innovation leader in markets that are evolving faster than ever before. To do that, we fueled innovation by reallocating resources and significantly increasing our investment in new product development. Then, to drive repeatable success and accelerate the pace of learning, we've developed a unique operating system, our product development engine and trained more than 10,000 employees how to use it. Across the organization, we're focused on delivering highly differentiated products and services that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. I believe our innovation leadership is sustainable because of the breadth and depth of our capabilities. Our ability to combine unique competencies, technology and intellectual property accelerates our innovation process and sets us apart from competitors. Having provided this context, I'll now describe the major inflections and investments taking place within our markets. Sales of memory chips are at record levels, fueled by increasing content in smartphones to support better cameras and VR applications as well as the need for more and higher performance storage in data centers. Market fundamentals remain strong and as a result, we're seeing robust investment from our memory customers. We believe we will see double-digit growth in DRAM spending this year and we expect NAND investment to be even stronger. Our view of 2018 and beyond is also positive for a number of reasons. The explosion of data storage requirements created by IoT, big data, AI and streaming video has only just begun. Data generation from new categories, such as Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicles, can potentially dwarf existing applications within a few years. As 3D NAND bit density increases and cost per bit falls, new segments of the storage market are opening up for solid-state drives. And at the same time, the bit density increase from generation to generation is slower for 3D than it was for planar NAND. To compensate, the industry needs more wafer starts and greenfield capacity. In foundry, we're also seeing an acceleration of investment, both at the leading edge and in trailing geometries. In 2017, we expect investment in new leading edge capacity to make up about 60% of total foundry spending. This is driven by demand for more sophisticated smartphone processors as well as customers positioning to win the major inflections in high-performance computing and data centers that are needed to start unlocking the potential of AI. Within foundry, logic and DRAM, I'm increasingly excited about our opportunities in patterning. As these customers move to smaller chip geometries, all the layers in the device scale. A limited number of layers will move to EUV, but significantly more will move to multi-patterning. This means our patterning opportunity will expand considerably over the coming years. Applied is making significant investments to enable the patterning road map. We've already increased our patterning revenues more than 60% in the past year and still have significant room to grow. Taking all these factors into consideration, we now believe that wafer fab equipment spending for the calendar year could be up about 15% relative to 2016 and our outlook for 2018 and beyond remains positive. Our expectations for the display market also continue to strengthen as a result of large inflections in both TV and mobile screen technology. Average TV sizes are expected to reach 44.5 inches in 2017, up 5 inches in the past 3 years. One of the key factors driving this growth is demand for large-format TVs, 60 inches and above. As customers optimize factories for these bigger screen sizes, they are investing in new Gen 10.5 capacity. In parallel, we see investment in mobile OLED getting stronger as confidence in the adoption rates of OLED technology increases. Recent forecasts indicate that 2/3 of new smartphones could have OLED displays by 2021 and screen manufacturers are accelerating their investment plans accordingly. My final comments about the market environment relate to China which is an important long term growth opportunity for Applied. We believe 2017 spending will be slightly higher than last year. And based on the projects we're tracking, we expect to see a significant and steady investment ramp in both semiconductor and display beginning in 2018. I'll now provide updates on the performance and priorities for our major business groups. Overall, Applied gained 2 points of wafer fab equipment share in 2016 and based on the strength of our product portfolio, I believe we'll add to those gains over the next several years. In our leadership businesses, such as PVD, epi, implant and thermal processing, where we have strong share and highly differentiated products, we're extending our advantage. The available market for our leadership products is also growing, specifically in PVD and CMP. In PVD, we expect our available market to expand by more than 30% in 2017 as foundry customers adopt new interconnect technology for lower power devices. And the CMP market grew 40% in 2016 and is on track to grow another 20% this year, primarily driven by increasing steps in 3D NAND. In our high-growth businesses, we're also outperforming our competitors in markets that are growing rapidly. In 2016, we gained about 5 points of share in conductor etch and 2 points in etch overall. This means that since 2012, we've won nearly 20 points of conductor share and 10 points of total etch share. These gains are driven by enabling technologies, like Sym3 and selective etch and new process steps. Our CVD business is also outpacing the market, gaining almost 6 points of market share in 2016. We have great momentum in these businesses and plenty of headroom to grow. Service represents a stable and growing revenue stream for the company. On a year-on-year basis, we've now grown service revenues for 14 consecutive quarters and our compound rate of growth has been around 10% over the past 4 years. Our expanding portfolio of service solutions plays an increasingly important role for customers, helping them compress ramp times, improving device performance and yield and optimize output and operating costs. Because of this, I'm confident that we can continue to grow service at a similar pace. Another exciting growth opportunity for Applied is display. Since 2012, we've grown display revenues around 20% per year and we have great momentum. This year, we're on track to book more than $2 billion of orders. Display technology and manufacturing is becoming increasingly complex and Applied is in a unique position to enable the road map. By leveraging our semiconductor experience and capabilities, we're delivering the innovative products our customers need to accelerate major technology transitions. Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me quickly summarize. Q2 was another record-breaking quarter and 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for Applied. Our markets are becoming even more attractive. They are growing sustainably and becoming less volatile. And Applied is playing a larger and more valuable role advancing the innovation road map. We have focused our strategy and investments to ensure that Applied is the innovation leader that consistently delivers highly differentiated products and services. As a result, we're raising the ceiling for our performance and potential. We're setting new records, growing our available market and gaining market share. Now let me hand the call over to Bob.
Robert Halliday: Thanks, Gary. Before going into the details of the quarter, I'll touch on 3 things that are sustainably better for Applied, one, our markets; two, our improving position in those markets which is enabling stronger gross margin performance; and three, our profitability and free cash flow. First, our markets are more attractive. We believe wafer fab equipment spending will be higher and less volatile for the foreseeable future. Display equipment spending also looks higher and more attractive, for Applied Materials in particular, because we're greatly increasing our served addressable market. Many of you have added valuable insights as to why WFE has become larger and less volatile. I believe it boils down to three things, one, the semiconductor market is growing and becoming more diverse; two, equipment intensity is increasing; and three, capital investment is measured and rational. This better industry environment is sustainable. As Gary mentioned, the semiconductor industry we enable has also become larger, more diverse and more critical to big innovations in the global economy. Today, we're seeing the emergence of new silicon-rich devices needed to enable the Internet of Things, cloud data centers and artificial intelligence. Data is becoming more valuable and harnessing the value requires silicon. For Applied, this translates to higher demand for logic and memory capacity at both the leading edge and trailing geometries. I believe the industry has seen a new wave of sustainable growth with economic value creation that justifies the cost of investment. Next, Applied's position in the markets in sustainably stronger. The changes we've made since 2013 in strategy, capital allocation and business systems, like the product development engine, have given us our strongest product pipeline in many years. I've been invited to an industrials conference this month to explain how our products are enabling big changes in manufacturing that many people call Industry 4.0. Here is how I plan to summarize our contribution without going into all of the technology. Applied has a very strong overall business that can be separated into just 2 parts. First, we have our leadership semi equipment and services business which together generate nearly 60% of our revenue. Our leadership semi businesses drive technologies that are critical to making transistors for data processing and networking. We've maintained steady growth and high share positions averaging about 70% because we bring unique value to our customers. Our services business is similar in that it is highly enabling to our customers and characterized by steady, profitable growth. We're deeply engaged with our logic and foundry customers to enable their advanced road maps with this part of our business. When you think about the big new chips used for artificial intelligence, think of Applied Materials. Second, we have our high-growth businesses which include etch and deposition used in 3D NAND and multi-patterning, along with inspection and display. Our high-growth businesses now represent about 40% of our revenue. We've made outsized investments in new and disruptive products in these areas to capitalize on the inflections we identified in 2013. Our high-growth semi businesses have been growing 40% faster than their markets and Applied's unique display equipment business is growing even faster. Another way to measure Applied's stronger position in the markets is to consider the changes in our share by semiconductor device type. In 2012, our share in foundry was over 20%, but our share in logic, DRAM and NAND was under 15%. Today, we believe our share is at least 22% in all 4. In fact, we're the #1 equipment company by revenue in NAND, DRAM, logic and foundry. So regardless of the spending mix, applied is well positioned. A great measure of the strength of our products, the value they bring to our customers and our execution as a company is gross margin expansion. Since 2013, we have increased our gross margins in our semi, services and display segments across virtually every business unit. In 2017, I believe we will deliver company non-GAAP gross margin of about 46% which would be up by about 5 points versus 2012 and the company's best annual performance in a decade. Now I'll talk about how these changes are flowing through the income statement to enable stronger profitability and shareholder returns. Over the 2013 to 2016 period, we have grown the revenue line by 44%. When we compared 2017 to 2013, we can see revenue growth of 90%. This revenue growth demonstrates the compounding benefits of our share gains and new product penetrations across semi, services and display. For the year, we expect our top line growth, gross margin performance and disciplined R&D investment and spending to generate the highest non-GAAP operating margin of the past 17 years and free cash flow of 20% or more. The company has returned 100% of the free cash flow we generated over the past 5 years and stands committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. Next, I'll comment on our performance during Q2. As a reminder, we no longer report quarterly orders because we're focused on driving year-over-year growth in revenue and profitability. Quarter-to quarter demand patterns can vary across our business. However, we have grown our revenue and non-GAAP EPS on a year-over-year basis in 14 of the past 15 quarters. In Q2, we grew company revenue by 45% year-over-year and increased non-GAAP gross margin by 3.6 points. Our non-GAAP operating expenses grew by only 14% over this period and we continue to invest 2/3 of OpEx in R&D to fuel our product development engine. We set new company records in profitability as we increased non-GAAP operating profit by 110% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share by 132% year-over-year. Now I'll compare our Q2 segment performance to the same period last year. We grew semiconductor systems revenue by 51% to $2.4 billion and non-GAAP operating margin by 9.7 points. We grew services revenue by 14% to a record $724 million and non-GAAP operating margin by 80 basis points. We more than doubled our display revenue to $391 million and increased non-GAAP operating margin by 4.9 points. Turning to the balance sheet. We grew cash from operations by 87% compared to the same period last year. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion of cash and investments and nearly half was onshore. This increase includes proceeds from $2.2 billion in debt raised in March to increase onshore liquidity. Soon after the end of the quarter, we used approximately $200 million of the offering to redeem our October 2017 notes. We returned $390 million to shareholders in the quarter, paying $108 million in dividend and using $282 million to repurchase 7 million shares of stock at an average price of $38.15. Now I'll provide our third quarter guidance. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.75 billion. The midpoint would be up by 30% year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, our semiconductor systems revenue should increase by about 41%. Services revenue should increase by about 13%. And display revenue should increase by about 27%. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 46.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $665 million, plus or minus $10 million. Non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.79 to $0.87, the midpoint of which would be up by 66% year-over-year. Finally, to help you with your models, we project revenue in Corporate and Other to be around $15 million. We expect non-GAAP interest and other expenses of about $42 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 10.2%. And in the fourth quarter, we expect non-GAAP OpEx to be around $675 million. The projected increase is primarily targeted at R&D for new opportunities we're pursuing in emerging inflections. To summarize, one, our markets are sustainably better than at any other time in the history of the company; two, our competitive position and execution is sustainably better, giving us a strong pipeline of new and disruptive products and gross margin expansion; three, this growth, combined with disciplined investment and spending, is generating higher free cash flow and we're committed to returning the excess to our shareholders. Now Mike, let's start the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions]. Let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI.
Christopher Muse: I guess question around sustainability. You're guiding WFE $40-plus billion here for '17. And curious, what gives you the confidence to be so upbeat looking into '18 and beyond? And I guess as part of that, would love to hear your thoughts in terms of the contributions from areas like AI and public cloud investments versus, I guess, more traditional areas like smartphone and PCs in the past.
Robert Halliday: Sure. Let me see if I can try to give you context. I think context rather than point answer is useful, give you context over time and context over breadth. So if you look at context, we thought back at Analyst Day last September that 2016 WFE would be about $33.7 billion. And in fact, it ended up a little over $35 billion. We thought at Analyst Day last year, this year would be $34.5 billion. And in fact, it started with a 4 number this year and it looks very healthy. So it's trending up. So then you say, well, where is it trending up? It's kind of up across the board. Earlier in the year, we thought it was kind of 5% up across the board. Now we think the whole thing is up 15%. We're seeing in DRAM, NAND, foundry. Tactically, we're seeing high utilization in all the fabs. We see no diminution of ordering patterns. We don't see double bookings or anything people might fear. So we see -- when you see strength across virtually every customer and virtually every device type, that goes to some root cause questions. So in my opinion, we're facing what we've been talking about for a while which is, there is more root cause demand drivers for devices. Now longer term, those root drive cause factors are going to be things like cars and AR/VR. What we're seeing now is tactically more content in the phones. We see a lot more content in the phones around NAND, DRAM and we also see strength within the processor side on both the cutting edge and the lagging edge. Lagging edge, again, this year, will be over 40% of device types. But the cutting edge is pretty strong, too. So we're seeing broadscale demand. My belief is that in the intermediate term, there's more content going in phones and more going into the big data centers which are both driving this which will help us. So then the question is, why is there more going in? We believe that there's, what I call broadly speaking, more applications for processor technology, more apps on top of it that are driving systemic demand. And I think, frankly, we're in the early innings of it. So if you ask me, okay, is the second half good? Yes, we're okay. If you ask me, is '18 good? Yes, I think it probably starts with a 4 again. It's pretty good. If you ask me long term which is what I spend a lot of time on, I see more root cause drivers for growth in semiconductor and silicon growth than I've seen in years and I think it's sustainable.
Gary Dickerson: And C.J., this is Gary. If you look out over time what drove our business in the past were the enterprise and PC upgrade cycles, then it moved to mobile, social media, very pervasive and driven by holiday season new products, where all of the consumer electronics companies had to have those products ready for Christmas or Chinese New Year. And as you go forward, we talked about AI and the importance of capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data is really going to disrupt big industries, transportation, health care, entertainment, manufacturing. And when you look at AI chips, almost every week, somebody's announcing a new AI chip, that it's at the -- logic devices that are at the physical limits of how big they can build those chips because there's so much value in these changes that are happening in these major industries. And of course, that's great for us. If you're building these big logic chips, you need better transistors, you need much better interconnect technology and you also need more memory which is materials-enabled and another area that's in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. So longer term, these inflections really create even more sustainability in terms of our markets going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: On the China domestic semiconductor market and the outlook there, especially as we think about looking into 2018, I think conservatively, we're tracking 3 to 4 domestic foundry programs and about 4 to 5 memory programs. Foundry, obviously, is a bit more mature. Memory, we're kind of early innings, like Phase 1 kind of development. But especially on sort of memory in China and we get this question a lot from investors which is, is the team starting to get pipeline visibility into some of these programs actually starting to fire the confidence level that these programs are going to contribute to potentially a growth outlook for 2018? Love to get your views here.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question. China's one of our strongest regions for both semiconductor and display, very deep customer relationships. And what we're looking at for 2017, if we compare to '15, it's about 2x growth in our semiconductor business, 50% growth in service, 50% in display. And the business is really driven by a couple of different strategic factors. One is, there's a big gap between supply and demand and there's this large drive to try to close that gap and then also building a secure supply chain. When we look into 2018, what we're seeing right now is that the overall wafer fab equipment spending could be meaningfully up, more than $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion from '17 to '18 and the domestic part of that increase is also up a meaningful amount in 2018. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything else?
Robert Halliday: Yes, I think that's pretty accurate. And if you ask us to look longer term, we see the domestic -- we see the total going up basically every year and the domestic part, in particular, going up every year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company.
Timothy Arcuri: Bob, I actually have 2 questions. Number one, just on the recent debt raise. I know you paid down $200 million of debt with that money. But I'm surprised that there's not kind of a new capital return that was announced with that. So I guess that's my first question. And then I wanted to also ask about SSG in the back half of the year because if I run the numbers on calendar first half of the year, you're sort of annualizing to like $42 billion WFE roughly. And if we're going to be at $40 billion for the year, then that would sort of say that the back half has to be down like roughly 10%. So I'm wondering if that math's right.
Robert Halliday: Yes, 2 complicated questions. The first one, we raised money frankly from an opportunistic point of view and frankly a shareholder perspective. So if you look it, we raised $2.2 billion, now we had to repay $2 billion -- $200 million, so it's about $2 billion net. And it was about 50% of it was 10-year money, about 50% was 30-year money. And the 10% money, maybe like 3.3% and 4.3%, okay? So the average rate is about 3.8%. So basically what we're bringing into our capital structure is long term debt at low rates that's pseudo-equity at low cost of capital. So that's pretty attractive. The second thing we're doing, many people believe that there'll be some type of tax policy change this year or next which will ease and facilitate the return of cash from overseas locations. Well, we're kind of hedging our bets. We're not sure about the timing and we want to stay committed to shareholder returns and keep our tax structure in place until there are any substantive changes. So I think this raise, if anything, was to continue to support meaningful returns of capital to investors. And as we said on the call, we've returned over 100% over the last 5 years. In this past quarter, the total was over $380 million, I think, between dividends and buybacks. So I think we're very committed to shareholder returns. We will hit the model which is shrinking the share count. And if we get more line of sight to what's going to happen on the tax policy, then we'll clearly react more effectively and more efficiently to how to maximize those shareholder returns. In terms of the -- how's the year look, we gave in the call a few data points. One, we said that our revenues in '17 fiscal year versus '13 were going to be up 90%. So you can see, we're going to have a good year. So my take on it is, the year is a good year. Our take on it is the year will continue to strengthen throughout the year. Our take on it is that we're going to gain share this year. So it's going to be a really good year for us. And that's just semi. Display, we're going to do well, too. We believe those drivers that drive the market and our share continue for a number of years. So is the number a $40 billion number or north of a $40 billion number? All we want to say now here in early May is it starts with a 4. It's up significantly from last year and it strengthened all year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Farhan Ahmad of Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad: My question is, you've already talked about it quite a bit. Generally just wondering if you guys have done any sort of analysis if one particular segment would benefit more than the other in terms of logic, NAND or foundry?
Gary Dickerson: I think relative to AI, as I mentioned earlier, you see announcements almost every week of new logic AI chips going to the physical limits of the reticle field, so the physical limits or the ability of the semiconductor companies to build those chips. So a tremendous amount of transistors, vias, interconnect technology, all of that is in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. Our Transistor and Interconnect Group, all of those different products, epi, PVD, CMP, thermal processing, implant, are really unique and very strong positions for Applied Materials. So that growth is really exactly aligned with the products that we have in logic and in foundry and give us really a great growth opportunity. The other part of it's the materials enables memory scaling. More and more you're seeing devices going from 2 dimensions to 3 dimensions. And as they're going to 3 dimensions, really, the ability to scale the performance and also the cost is all about new materials, new deposition, epi, new etch technology, selective removal, all of those areas. And personally, I'm increasingly optimistic that we have very innovative, highly differentiated new technologies that will not only enable further scaling in 3D NAND technology, but also enable new memory technologies. Our position there is very, very strong. The relationships and the engagements that we have with customers are broader and deeper than we've ever had in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi.
Atif Malik: I have a question on the display part. So at the Analyst Day last year, you guys talked about expanding the TAM on the display products from 15% to 30%, 40% over the next 2 years. Just curious, how are your engagements going with those new display products so far?
Gary Dickerson: So we have very broad and deep relationships with all the leading companies in display and also the leading consumer electronics companies that are using those displays. So we're in a really great position to enable these new technologies. And as customers are moving forward with new display technology, it increases our total available market and puts us in a good position to continue to grow that business. If you look at display overall, you really have 2 big drivers. One is the strong organic LED for mobile opportunity and that is a broadening out to a large number of customers and also, the increased adoption of larger TV screens. So both of those are driving our business. As I said earlier, we have very strong and deep relationships with leading customers and we're focused on the biggest technology challenges. If you look at all of those customers that want to get into the growing mobile OLED market, we're focused on the major technology challenges that enable those customers to build those kinds of devices. We're not ready to announce any specific opportunities at this point in time but we will later this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sreekrishnan Sankar: The question I had was WFE running at 40 billion, 40 plus billion this year and next year, where do you think 3D NAND WFE is within that? And if the prices for NAND roll over, the reality of economics kick in and 3D NAND makers scale back the CapEx. Or do you think demand is strong enough to continue investing in capacity for the next 2 to 4 years?
Robert Halliday: Sure. So the question was, is 3D NAND going to keep expanding? Is that -- yes. So let me take a shot at that. So 3D NAND spending is up this year. It was up again last year. If you look at it, there's about 1.6 million wafer starts in the world of 3D NAND -- NAND in total. By the end of this year, they will convert at 750,000 wafer starts per month. So there's still a fair amount that's going to convert. I think that the vast majority that's going to convert over time because 3D performs better than 2D. I think what also helps memory in general, particularly NAND, is that more and more customers' customers are starting swap out 3D NAND over time for hard disk drives. So overall, demand for memory is going up. The share of NAND, far versus how this drive will trend up and 3D will be the NAND of choice versus 2D. So they're early in the build-out, 750,000. They got to get to 1.6 million. And we think that the installed capacity is going to go up over time because of this demand. Then if you look at greenfield versus refresh, we're kind of agnostic, frankly. So if you look at the cost of doing a greenfield 3D NAND factory, we do well. In fact, we're gaining share at virtually every product, I believe. If you look at transition of one 3D to a higher level of 3D, the revenue opportunity for us is about the same.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Chin of UBS.
Stephen Chin: Just a follow-up question on the higher outlook for wafer fab equipment spending. What customer type is driving that big increase in your WFE? And do you think this $40 billion number is the new normalized level for WFE and not a peak?
Robert Halliday: Yes, it was seen across the board. We're seeing it at NAND, DRAM and foundry. Logic's kind of flattish. We're seeing it at almost every customer, I think, too. So it's very broad. And when you get that broad, it's not, hey, they're timing DRAM, they're putting more DRAM in a PC. The root cause is broader than that because it's across a wide range of device types of customers. So then you say, what is the application for driving? We do think it's more and more about more applications for your PC and your data center and stuff like that. So it does start to see these AI stuff, deep learning. Can I point exactly how much does AI I know? But it's across the board we're seeing this, right? So then in terms of the number, those are, I called earlier, I think this year begins with a 4. But I'm not saying it's 40, frankly. It's a good number and I think next year's a good number. So I actually think the new normal is 40 plus. I think what I worry about internally at the company, that we don't plan more for the upside than downside. I think there's more opportunity on the upside than the downside.
Gary Dickerson: One thing I'd add to that is that I think everybody is seeing a large increase in the amount of data and also the value of the data. If you look at deep learning, the amount of data that you process is going to go up. Right now, a lot of data's thrown away. So you've got an increase in the amount of data and then the amount of data that's processed is also going to increase. So both of those factors make me personally pretty bullish about the memory business long term. And certainly, that's also what we're hearing from our customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Romit Shah of Nomura.
Romit Shah: I did notice that display revenues were a little light in the quarter and that margins were down about 5 points. Can you talk about that, Bob? Is that just short term noise? And last quarter, you gave a target for display. I think it was up -- for 2017, up 50%. Do you still feel good about that?
Robert Halliday: Yes, we do. It's just timing and it's just logistical. Display's going to have a really good year. The underlying market dynamics are very strong for both TVs and mobile. And our position's really good. So I think display is strongly a lot of opportunity. And then we have a product cycle we've discussed coming on board later in the year. So I'm bullish on display and I think I wouldn't read too much in these quarterly numbers. In terms of the numbers we set last quarter, yes, we'll hit those. Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Bob, I had a question on gross margins. You guys showed nice upside in the quarter. And just wondering what the drivers were here. In the past, I think you pointed to outsized growth and things like etch and display that were headwinds to the business. The recent improvement, is that a function of that headwind abating? Or is that a combination of mix shift and also fundamental and sustainable improvement across the board?
Robert Halliday: Yes. If you look at a company like Applied, the gross margin improvement or change is a function primarily of 2 things and one third thing that's a little smaller. One is execution and second is mix and the third which is a little smaller, is absorption with volume, right? So if you look at execution, that's really three things, how you're executing cost reduction; how you're executing on new product development; and how you're executing in terms of field execution. So if you go look at it, this year, we're up a lot. We're up over a couple -- I don't know, several points. And if you look at it, I would say that the improvement -- we have underlying improved execution. So this year, we're up about almost, what, 3 points? So if you look at it this year, execution is trending up and that'll continue on for a while. I think every year, we'll get better.  Now we're benefiting from pretty good mix shifts. It's been a good year for our products in the TIG family, PVD, epi, things like that. And so it's helped a little bit. And absorption's helped a little bit this year. It's a pretty big year. It's over 40 and we're gaining share. But I would say that the overall gross margin performance of the company will trend up over time, but this year was helped a little bit by volume and by mix. But I would say I'm still positively upward bound on margins. So if you go -- if we have to redo a model in Analyst Day, I'd probably lean in on a higher WFE and higher margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: I wanted to follow up on some of the questions on the upward revision in WFE, particularly with regards to memory. We look at sort of memory cash flows and make some assumptions that there's just an algorithmic percentage of that peak cash flow that gets spent which is probably more negative than what you guys are describing that there are sort of people who are looking at the current situation and deciding that they need more supply. I mean, I guess it's more semantics, I guess. But how do you characterize when you see the upward revision that we've seen in just a 6-month window? How much of that is just because prices are better, companies have cash flow and they use it to improve their competitive position versus something that's more sort of structural and dynamic? How do you interpret it as more structural aspect versus just better pricing?
Robert Halliday: We look at a few things. Yes, we dug into this ourselves, too. We looked at what's driving this data. We looked at some cosmic data. So we looked at the stuff like how much data is captured out there. And we capture -- it was like 8 zettabytes of data was captured in 2016, I think, close to 25 zettabytes of data in 2020 and then it goes to like 45 zettabytes of data. So more and more data has been captured. It's gone up a lot, even in your homes, your cars, your industry, your companies. Then we look at the transmission, processing, source of that data we talked about. So when we start to look at root causes, we've seen a lot of this stuff, right? So then you go look at what's going on more close to planet Earth. And so we looked at this and we said, well, what's going on with NAND and DRAM? We split them up. DRAM's up but it's the still not through the roof. It's pretty good but still kind of restrained because a fair amount of this budget's being spent on NAND. So DRAM price is good. NAND price is good. Supply and demand's okay. So the DRAM, I would say, has probably gotten a little more upside than downside, frankly, in '18 because this year it hasn't been through the roof. It's up from what we thought earlier in the year. And then if you look at NAND, they're selling all the 3D NAND they can build. So it's still pretty good and I do think it goes to these longer term trends they have at NAND. So then if you look at the -- the final thing is just, well, how come you guys are low early in the year? And I think it goes to 2 root causes which, frankly, inflict all of us. One is I think we're a little bit a prisoner of past thinking. So okay, it can only go so high. But it goes to what Gary said earlier. There's different fundamental demand drivers at a simple level. It was, hey, use PCs. Then we agreed, okay, in 2010, mobile's coming in. And then -- but now you had all this big data stuff in content which is going up. That's what's really up last year. So it's content in the phones, content in the data centers, right? And so when you start to look, what were we inflicted with? We were saying, oh, we're going to roll over. But maybe there's real demand drivers here, number one. And number two, sometimes we listen too closely to our customers on a tactical basis.  They have to give us good demand forecast for kind of 6 months out so we could build the tools. Beyond that 6 months, maybe they're a little conservative to what they say to us for various reasons. So I think there are tactical reasons why we're a little too conservative. And I think that will -- data that shows it's not overbought now and there are longer term reasons that make you think this is very sustainable.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel.
Patrick Ho: Gary or Bob, in terms of the display business for you guys, we do see the longer term trends of OLED. Can you give a little bit of qualitative commentary on the LCD side of things, how you're benefiting this year as TV sizes do grow larger? Is this also one of those sustainable trends? Or is this just going to be a 1-year or 1.5-year phenomenon as the industry transitions on that front?
Robert Halliday: Yes, I'll start and Gary can jump in. Gary's TV aging is a little obsolete at his home base, but I'll start. So if you go look at this year, we're going to be strong in both TVs and mobile. TV's largely LCD. Mobile is -- the spending is largely for OLED, okay? So if you look at the 2 drivers, in OLED, it's conversion of the phones which we've talked about. My estimate is likely early in '18, about 37%, 38% of the phones, there'll be capacity to make them OLED even though the demand is there. We think it will be about 55%, as we said earlier in kind of 2020. I think it is 67%, 2021. So really, OLED phone displays is kind of supply constrained, to be honest with you. So that's very sustainable. I think it will keep going up beyond 67% is my opinion, too, in 2021. I remember everything, we got backlog kind of ships 6 to 9 months later. So you have extra length on the revenue. Then if you go to TVs, what's really driving the TVs is the big TVs. So we said at Analyst Day that through 2020, I think it was, we're tracking 7 Gen 10.5 fabs. We're now up to 9. And so -- and those [indiscernible] is just starting to ship, okay? And those fabs, on average, spend more than a Gen 8.5. I think there's been about $2.2 billion where it's like $1.2 billion, I think, on a Gen 8.5. So this big TV stuff's got legs for a while. And the capital intensity for these bigger fabs is good and our position's real good.
Operator: Our next question comes from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities.
Weston Twigg: You mentioned earlier on the call regarding bit density and 3D NAND from generation to generation being slower than the planar NAND conversion. So just wondering, could you give us an idea on how much more fab capacity might be needed annually to drive, say, 40% bit growth and what the incremental opportunity can be for AMAT?
Robert Halliday: Sure. Some of this goes to what I said earlier. So we see and I think we're a little bit on the low side sometimes, that NAND bit growth is going to be probably in the high 30s or something like that. Now last year was much higher. If you look at content in phones, it was up like -- the data we got from an outside service provider was 57%. So there are indications that we're on the low side on some of these things. Plus we're not sure we've captured all the movement to hard disk drives. So I'd say I'm more on the over camp in that number than the under. So then if you go look at it, as I said earlier, the 750,000 wafer starts by the end of this year, we think that they're going to have to continue to spend in dollars WFE content similar to this year for a number of years. Now if they spend on greenfield or they spend on conversions, we're kind of agnostic from a revenue point of view. But we think the total spending is similar to this year for a number of years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Ellis of B. Riley.
Craig Ellis: I wanted to follow up on the comments that you had, Bob, that there were some project-related R&D spending in the outlooks numbers. The question is to what extent is that more of a near term micro opportunity that the company is using versus something that may be more longer term and structural, either because you're viewing the market opportunity differently over the next few years and are chasing some additional existing SAM or as you look at different opportunities, chasing some new SAM that's emerged over the last 3 to 6 months?
Robert Halliday: Yes. I think increasing the R&D spend was a wise decision, frankly. I think that when we showed you the model -- if you go back to 2013 when I first got here, we showed the first model. Our base case model was kind of a $30 billion base case. And then we did a $33.5 billion. Last year, it was $34.5 billion, I think. If I had to do a base case model for the industry, it's probably -- it's going to be north of that. I don't want to presell Analyst Day in September, but it's obviously north of that. The second thing is our position's a lot stronger. We used to be 18% of WFE and I think last year, we were like 22% or something. We're still going up. Our model is to hit the 25.5%.  We're comfortable with that. So if you look at Applied and then display, the magnitude of the change is big or bigger. It was an $8 billion spending environment when we set up and now it's kind of twice that. Our product pipeline is good. So I think the wise decision is to continue to invest in the opportunities. Now customers are coming to us more and more because we've become even more innovative than we were. So if you look at the range of products we're doing, the innovation in terms of the pipeline, really good. So we're getting lots of pull from customers to develop new products. They're taking more and more demo tools from us. We're getting more and more applications. So I think it's money well spent. I think it'll probably trend up. If you look at the model, probably a little bit of risk that the OpEx is higher than the model, but OpEx as a percentage of sales is down 10 points from 2013 by the end of this year. If you look at operating margins, they're up significantly and will probably beat the model. The upside's lower than the downside on the revenue gross margin, operating margins in the model.
Gary Dickerson: In terms of where we're focused, the strategy for us has been inflection-focused innovation. There are really big inflections that are happening at 10- and 7-nanometer. When you're building these AI chips that are as big as the physical limits, there are a lot of technology challenges. We talked about PVD growing this last year to enable the interconnect -- new interconnect technology for lower-power devices. You've got high-performance memory chips also where the PVD is growing for us. And in the -- and the memory area, the ability to scale 3D NAND, is there's big technical challenges there for our customers. And it's really all about etch, deposition. We've got very innovative new materials. The etch area, we've grown our market share significantly over the last few years. Great products, some of the best products I've ever seen in my life. Sym3 is the fastest-growing product in the history of the company. The Selectra product, where we have 1,000 to 1 selectivity. These are enabling customers to build devices that were never possible before and build them in different ways, scale these new technologies, build the logic devices at the physical limits or -- and the same thing is true in display. For organic LED mobile displays, there are technology challenges that are facing customers that want to ramp new factories for those new types of devices. So for me, personally, we've -- I look at Applied Materials, our competencies, technologies, talent is really unbelievable and sets us apart from any other company. And we're really in a sweet spot of all of these major inflections. So we've certainly moved a lot of money within the company over the last few years. The OpEx as a percentage of revenue has been going done. But we're going to invest to enable these inflections and drive sustainable growth for the company. The opportunities for us have never been better.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham.
Edwin Mok: Just want to circle back on China. You guys mentioned expect a pretty significant pickup in spending in China in 2018. Maybe if I -- we focus on the memory side. We've seen like some of these customer announce pretty aggressive road map for the 3D NAND technology. Just wondering, is this bigger spending in '18 predicated on those customer hitting those targets or rolling out those devices and if they have issues going on with the devices that delay the spending that you expect in '18?
Gary Dickerson: We have a range of forecast for China. So as I said earlier, it's one of our strongest regions in both semiconductor and display. We have very, very deep relationships with many of these customers. Right now, what we believe for 2018 is that the business will be up meaningfully from 2017. But frankly, that's also at the most likely and low risk end of the forecast. There's a higher range there that would be going up at a much faster pace. We're looking at early indicators for all of those new projects, but I think right now, we're pretty confident that the increase in China in 2018 will happen. Maybe it's $1 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of total wafer fab equipment. So that we have pretty high confidence in terms of the engagements or the information we're getting from all of those customers. There is upside potential, but that's our current view.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.
Shek Ho: Going back to the question on capital returns, your free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has come up quite a bit over the past 5 years. I think it was averaging like 15% and now it was more like 20%-plus. Your dividend yield has come down quite a bit as well just because your stock has done so well. But with the long term debt you raised recently, I know you explained that earlier in the call, but just curious, are there any changes to your philosophy in capital returns? I guess specifically, why not raise your dividend and maybe spend a little less on buybacks and -- given dividend hasn't gone up for a number of years? Or are you saving some dry powder for future M&A?
Robert Halliday: I think we'll probably -- I think we'll continue to return -- the total of all cash to investors will be very, very healthy. I think that the mix will probably morph over time through dividends. We haven't made a firm commitment but I think it will happen. I think the 2 things that I'm kind of watching is, one, I think I'd like to see tax policy because dividend's a firm, fixed commitment. As soon as you make it, then you got to hit it every quarter. And you really have to lean into where you're going to end up, what's your end stake, because people look at the yield, not with -- did you raise it $0.02 a quarter. So we have to commit to a dividend increase over time that gets to effective yield. And with the stock going up, that cash commitment has gone up. So I'm willing to do that, but I'd like to see clarity on the tax policy before I make that fixed commitment to an increasing yield.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Sydney, for the question. And Latiff, time check. I just want to see if there's anyone in the queue still.
Operator: Yes, sir, we do have one more question in queue.
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Thank you. We'll take that question and then we'll bring it back to me. Thanks.
Operator: That question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: You guys talked a lot about some of the trends driving logic and foundry, AI, deep learning, VR, data center. And it's interesting because these drivers have some of the biggest chip sizes in the industry, right? In videos, the latest deep learning chip has 18 billion transistors on a single piece of silicon. Broadcom's latest data center switching chip has like 7 billion transistors. These are huge chips, right? My point is that each of these units is consuming more silicon but they're also requiring more leading-edge complex manufacturing. So this is great for capital intensity trends. It's great for equipment business. But frankly, it's a nightmare from a yield perspective. So help us understand the trends you're seeing in your metrology and inspection business and how you guys are helping your customers improve yields. You guys gained share in this segment last year. How do you think this segment grows relative to your overall semi systems business this year?
Gary Dickerson: Okay. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Yes. Again, on the large logic chips that you talked about, we actually had the NVIDIA CEO here just a few months ago. And one of the questions was, really, what does all of this mean to us? And he talked about physical, the chip's as big as they can physically build them. And actually, he also said, a million times more memory. So all of those things are obviously positive for Applied Materials. In inspection share, we're -- or inspection business, we're growing significant amount. We had record revenue in '16. We're on track for record revenue in '17. And if you look at our e-beam business which is our largest part of PDC which includes e-beam inspection, e-beam review and CD-SEM, we're going to be up in '17 more than 50% versus '15. We have very, very strong technology position with world-class electron optics and very strong customer pull for e-beam products in logic, foundry and repeat orders for the PROVision in memory with some large customers. So very, very strong position. We have great technology, very strong customer pull and we believe that we're going to continue the growth that we've seen over the last couple of years in our PDC business.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Well, thanks, Harlan, for the question. And Bob, would you like to add anything else before we close the call?
Robert Halliday: Sure. Thanks, Mike. One of Gary's favorite expressions around here is innovation's about connecting the dots. Let me see if I connect a few dots that I -- we believe and I hope you heard today. One, we believe the wafer fab equipment market is sustainably higher and less volatile. Also, display is higher and for Applied, it's sustainably a better market because there are more technology inflections and because we're growing our served market. Second, Applied's position in the market is sustainably stronger. And we're executing better and better. And third, we're generating more free cash flow and returning the excess to our shareholders. Speaking of free cash flow, one of your own interesting note comparing Applied Materials to some of the top names in the industrial sector. Relative to the average of the companies, Applied has higher revenue and profit growth along with higher ROIC and free cash flow margins. Compared to these companies, I believe we're being discounted for being more cyclical even as we become demonstrably less cyclical. I believe that over time, we'll be viewed and valued in a new way. So thank you for your time today. And we look forward to seeing many of you in person over the next few weeks.
Michael Sullivan: Well, great. Thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of the call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, you may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.

Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. I'm happy to report that Applied Materials delivered another record quarter in Q1. With earnings and orders exceeding all-time highs, 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year. As I look ahead, I see broad-based strength in our markets as large multiyear inflections evolve and new emerging demand drivers layer on top of mobility and computing. I'm also increasingly confident that Applied is positioned to sustainably grow faster than our markets, as we realize the benefits of the investments we have been making in our organization and product pipeline. On today's call, I'll begin with a quick recap of our strategy and provide an update on the key trends and industry inflections that are driving our growth. I'll then translate these into an outlook for Applied's markets before concluding with a brief overview for each of our businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our performance and his perspective on 2017 and beyond. The significant changes in semiconductor and display technology that are taking place today depend on materials innovation. At Applied, our strategy is to deliver innovative materials engineering technologies to enable these major inflections. Across the company, we are focused on extending our innovation leadership and delivering solutions that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. As I've outlined previously, there are five large multiyear inflections that are underpinning our record performance today and we believe will fuel our growth for years to come. I'm going to take a few minutes to provide an update on each of these drivers as well as describe how our strategy of inflection-focused innovation positions Applied for sustainable profitable growth. Let me begin with 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies in foundry and logic. We are seeing significant investments by our customers to meet demand for leading-edge silicon to power increasingly capable mobile devices, 4K video, and new compute-intensive applications like artificial intelligence and smart vehicles. This sustained investment in advanced technology plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses, where we have unique capabilities and high market share. The second driver is 3D NAND, which is a great example of materials-enabled scaling. We believe NAND bit demand grew about 45% in 2016 and that 2017 will be similar. Major memory companies are saying this growth rate is sustainable over the next several years. Our opportunity in NAND is also expanding. While 3D NAND has significant performance and power advantages, the bit density increase achieved moving from generation to generation is slower than it was for planar NAND. To compensate, more wafer starts are needed. The third driver for Applied is patterning, a market which is growing rapidly. It's important to recognize that as customers move to smaller chip geometries, all the layers in the device scale. Some layers will move to EUV [Extreme Ultraviolet] and others to multi-patterning. This means that even in the most aggressive EUV adoption case, our patterning opportunity still expands considerably. Patterning is an area where Applied is making significant investments. We increased our patterning revenues more than 60% in 2016, and we have significant room to grow. Beyond semiconductor, another unique growth driver for Applied is advanced display, where two major market inflections are underway. The first is rapid growth in large-format TVs 60 inches and above, which is driving investment in new Gen 10.5 capacity as customers optimize factories for bigger screen sizes. We are now tracking seven Gen 10.5 projects. In parallel, there's a battle for leadership in next-generation mobile screens, and demand for our OLED manufacturing equipment is broadening. We see half of this demand coming from new entrants. As a result, in the past few months, our view of display spending has strengthened further. We now see customers increasing their investments by around $3 billion in 2017, $1 billion more than we thought in November. Our early view of 2018 is also positive. The fifth driver I'll cover is China, which is an important long-term growth opportunity for Applied in both semiconductor and display. While we believe 2017 spending will be similar to last year, based on the new factory projects we are tracking, we expect to see a significant ramp in investment in 2018 and beyond. Now, I'll translate these major inflections into our market outlook. Due to strong shipments in December, we now believe 2016 wafer fab equipment spending ended the year at around $35 billion. We expect 2017 to be higher still, up 5% or more year on year. Within this spending, we see strength across the board with foundry, NAND, DRAM, and logic investments all growing relative to 2016. Our early view of 2018 wafer fab equipment is also positive for a number of reasons. We see foundry investment broadening. We believe memory fundamentals will remain strong, fueled by explosive growth in data and investment in new technologies. When we look at customers' total capital spending, we see healthy investment in new factory shells, and we expect spending in China to accelerate in 2018 and beyond. Looking to the future, we're increasingly excited about trends in virtual and augmented reality, big data, and artificial intelligence and smart vehicles. These new applications require major advances in silicon and display technology and create huge demand for memory. These new drivers layer on top of existing demand for mobility, PCs, and other consumer electronics and have the potential to fuel a new phase of industry growth. All of this reinforces our perspective that our markets are becoming stronger and less cyclical. I'll now provide a brief update on each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, 2016 was a big share gain year for Applied. While we'll wait for Gartner's final sizing in April before providing all the details, we believe we have gained around 2 points of overall wafer fab equipment share. These gains are broad-based, with especially strong adoption of our new products. In 2016, about 40% of our revenue came from products that we've launched in the past three years. We have great momentum and fully expect to add to these gains in 2017. In our first quarter, semi equipment revenue and orders were at a 16-year high, with our highest orders ever in etch, CVD, and processed diagnostics and control. In display, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and orders. Since 2012, we have grown display revenues around 20% per year, and we believe we'll book $2 billion of orders in 2017. As display technology becomes more complex, we are focused on building out our product portfolio to deliver the solutions our customers need. We have great traction with our new thin film encapsulation and e-beam review products and have more significant new products that we'll announce later this year. In Service, our strategy is to deliver more value to customers with our advanced service products. We're focused on reducing ramp times, improving device performance and yield, and optimizing output and operating costs for our customers. We're seeing the impact of our investments and are increasing our share of the service opportunity. On a year-on-year basis, we've now grown our service business for 13 consecutive quarters, and our orders in Q1 were also an all-time high. Before I hand the call over to Bob, let me quickly summarize. Q1 was another record-breaking quarter, and we expect 2017 to be an outstanding year for the company. The large multiyear inflections that are driving our business remain firmly in place, and our markets are growing and becoming less cyclical. We expect wafer fab equipment and display investments to be up in 2017, and our initial view of 2018 is also positive. Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is delivering results. We are outperforming in semiconductor with strong share gains, sustainably growing our service business, and we are uniquely positioned to drive significant growth in display. Overall, we are increasingly confident that we can maintain our trajectory of sustainable growth and raise the ceiling on our performance. Now, I'll ask Bob to provide more details about our results and outlook. Bob?
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Gary. Applied's momentum continues in the new fiscal year, with record orders and earnings both up substantially from a year ago, and we're guiding for new revenue and earnings records in Q2. For investors with a long memory, this kind of performance raises old questions about peaks and sustainability. However, I'm confident that our markets are materially better, and I believe that Applied's ability to deliver value and profitability is increasingly stronger and more sustainable. Last quarter I gave you numbers showing that the industry is now larger and significantly less volatile. Some of you did the math and saw that this is true. I believe investors will come to recognize that the industry truly is more attractive, owing to three important factors. First is that our customers have fully absorbed a tremendous amount of productivity. The list includes: the 300-millimeter wafer size transition; cycle time reductions; supplier consolidation, including the IDM [Integrated Device Manufacturer] to foundry transition; the shift to highly productive mega-fabs; better inventory management; reuse strategies; and disciplined profit-minded investment by our customers. Second is capital intensity. A steadily rising amount of capital equipment is needed to build each type of chip, and customers increasingly need the kind of equipment Applied makes. For example, patterning smaller lines takes more CVD, CMP, and etch steps. Logic and foundry chips need more metal layers and new materials. And 3D NAND memories add bits at a slower rate than 2D shrinks. You can see these factors playing out in the capital intensity curves for the industry. Third is that we are seeing more demand drivers. In NAND, server farms are early in the transition from hard disks to solid-state drives. In logic and foundry, leading technology and automotive companies are designing custom high-performance chips for artificial intelligence. Manufacturers are adding sensors, intelligence, and communications into all kinds of commercial and consumer products, creating the Internet of Things. The additional data that's being created drives further demand for advanced processors and memory. And we have many engagements with new companies in China who are strategically committed to participating in future waves of growth. Gary mentioned that we expect WFE spending to be up by over 5% this year, which would give us the highest level of investment seen to date. 2017 investment does not include a wafer size transition as in 2000 or a surge in commodity DRAM investment as in 2007 or an unusually large year of MOCVD spending as in 2011. In fact, I believe our 2017 forecast reflects measured prudent customer spending designed to meet strong demand patterns that we are seeing continue into 2018 and beyond. Our customers will continue to benefit from making big investments in leading-edge capacity to power devices and the cloud. I believe concerns about the cost/benefit of Moore's Law are anchored on the value of yesterday's applications. Consider the value being created by companies who are using technology to transform industries like advertising, retailing, transportation, television, and travel. Today, they are making massive investments in new applications that depend on further innovations in processors, memories, and displays, and a lot more capacity. I see a very healthy future in this for Applied Materials. At Applied, we changed the investment model to deliver higher returns. We aggressively shifted dollars from G&A to R&D and from sustaining R&D to impactful new product R&D. We significantly increased the percentage of winning products, and we accelerated our new product development timelines. These trends have multiplicative effects and are continuing. As a result, we are outperforming our markets and benefiting from delivering more valuable products and services to our customers. Let's start with revenue growth. As Gary said, we expect WFE spending to grow by around 5% or more in calendar 2017. In fiscal 2017, we anticipate that our Services group will grow at twice that rate. Our Semiconductor Systems business will grow at four times that rate, and our Display business will grow at 10 times that rate. As a result, we are gaining share in our markets. The best indication of the value that we provide is profit margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 45.4% in Q1, the second highest since 2008. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 26%, a 9-year high. And next quarter, we plan to be higher in both. Our revenue growth and margin expansion are resulting in strong free cash flow, which grew by more than 300% in Q1 from the same period last year. And we are committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. In addition, we're closely monitoring the policy environment. As a U.S.-based manufacturer with strong exports and a global manufacturing network, we have a great deal of flexibility in adapting to the new policies being considered. Next, I'll comment on our performance during Q1 as compared to the same period last year. Orders of $4.2 billion were our highest ever and broad-based. We had a 16-year high in semiconductor systems orders, record orders in services, and very strong display orders of $632 million. In Q1, we grew company revenue by 45% and increased non-GAAP gross margin by 300 basis points. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew by 14% to the high end of the guidance range. Our ongoing spending discipline helped us to more than double our non-GAAP operating profit. We've reduced the non-GAAP tax rate by 6.2 points, and we grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 158%. Next, I'll compare our segment performance during Q1 to the same period last year. We grew Semiconductor Systems revenue by 57% and non-GAAP operating margin by 11.5 points. We grew Services revenue by 12% and non-GAAP operating profit by 1.9 points. We also grew display revenue by 66% and non-GAAP operating profit by 8.4 points. On the balance sheet, we grew cash and investments by 23% to $5.1 billion, and about 36% remained onshore. We paid cash dividends of $108 million and used $130 million for stock buybacks, reducing the ending share count by 5% year over year to 1.08 billion. Now I'll provide our guidance for the second quarter. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.6 billion. The midpoint would be up by 44% year over year. On a year-over-year basis, our Semiconductor Systems revenue should increase by about 51%. Services revenues should increase by about 9%, and display revenue should increase by about 122%. In addition, non-GAAP gross margin should be about 45.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $645 million plus or minus $10 million. And non-GAAP EPS should be in the range of $0.72 to $0.80, the midpoint of which would be up by 124% year over year. In summary, we are raising the ceiling on our expectations for the industries we serve, and we believe our markets will remain strong. We've fundamentally changed our investment model to deliver greater value to our customers, and we are seeing that value reflected in higher market share and profitability. This stronger performance is sustainable, resulting in greater free cash flow. Now, Mike, let's start the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have an additional question later, please poll the operator and we'll do our best to answer it later in the call. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: Yes, sir. Our first question is from Farhan Ahmad of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking my question. My first question is in regards to the linearity of the year. Some of your peers have indicated a significant decline in the second half of the year, primarily driven by 3D NAND, and I just wanted to understand. Is that something you are seeing as well?
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: Sure, Farhan. So let me give you some context for how we think about the year and longer term. We are really driving, Farhan, frankly achieving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue and share of profit. That's how we think about the business and look at it. As for 2017, this will be another good year. We see WFE up 5% or more in the year. And then for our fiscal year, as I said in the call, our semiconductor revenue should grow at 4x that rate. Our services revenue should grow at 2x that rate, and our display revenue would grow at over 10x that rate. So if you look at it, we gave you actuals for Q1 and guide for Q2. Our full year should model just as I said just now. So with that, I think you get a pretty good feel for the second half of the year for us.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Farhan.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from C.J. Muse out of Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a question around display. How should we be thinking about the linearity of spend there first half/second half on a calendar year basis? And then considering I think you said in the prepared remarks you expect to book roughly $2 billion of revenues there here in the calendar year. How should we think about the trajectory of revenues through calendar 2018? And I guess as part of that, I would love to hear your thoughts on new product introductions and when we should think about weaving I guess incremental revenues from there in there as well. Thank you.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: Sure, I'll start, and Gary can jump in. Display continues to go up for us, frankly. In terms of the market context, when we did the Analyst Day back in September in New York, we thought that 2016 would be WFE numbers of around $14.5 billion, as I remember, and we thought the next year would be about a similar number in calendar 2017. And we're thinking now it's about $17.4 billion in 2017, so the market is up about $3 billion from where we thought. In terms of our own performance, I'll do bookings first. We booked over $2 billion in 2016. We weren't sure we could get that same volume in 2017 because some of those 2016 bookings ship through 2017 and 2018. In fact, we now think the bookings are pretty close in 2017 to what they were in 2016. What's particularly interesting for me in that bookings mix for 2017 is, if you go back to history, we used to be about 60% or so of our bookings were mobile, 65% some years, and about – 65% for TVs, 35% mobile. It kind of flipped last year. We thought we'd continue that this year. We're strong in both this year. TV has come back strong. We mentioned the Gen 10.5 fab. We see seven more of those we're tracking. So this year we think we'll book about 55% for TV, 45% mobile, so strong in both frankly. Then if you look at the revenues, which you asked about, this year we think our revenues are going to be pretty strong throughout the year. In terms of the quarterization, it's a little lumpy. Our Q3 might be a little stronger than our Q2, but pretty strong every quarter.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: I could add a little bit more also, C.J., on display. So if you put display in perspective, it's a great example of our ability to take materials engineering into an adjacent market. And if you go over a four-year period of time, from 2012 to 2016, our orders have increased from around $400 million to $2 billion, so – over $2 billion, about a 5x increase in four years in display, which is incredible. But again, it shows the ability to take our materials innovation technologies, CVD, PVD, thin film encapsulation, into a new market. And we've talked about – Bob talked about the TV sizes increasing and the seven Gen 10.5 projects. OLED, mobile is also expanding to new customers. 50% of our demand going forward for this year is new customers for the mobile OLED. And then we've been focused on inflections and increasing our total available market. We've talked about tripling our served market as we go forward. And certainly as these new technologies like OLED or flexible OLED are adopted, that increases our total available market. We've been driving new technologies like thin film encapsulation and e-beam review, again, reusing technologies that we have within our semiconductor business in display. You ask about the new products that we've talked about, and what we've said is that we'll announce those sometime during 2017. But what I would say – and we're not going to do that today, but what I would say is that those projects are on track and tremendous customer pull and investment for those new opportunities.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. So I just wanted to try to ask the question again, Bob, just on the learnings for the year. So if you look at your run rate based upon what you just booked, and if I assume roughly 25% WFE share, which is in your model, you're run-rating at roughly $44 billion – not you, but the industry. And if the year is going to be $37 billion, the math would say that you have to get to $30 billion sometime during the back half of the year. Now maybe things don't fall off that much. But I'm just wondering if you can take those numbers and tell us if you think shipments are going to fall off during the back half of the year because the math seems to say that either shipments are going to fall off quite a bit or WFE is going to be a lot better than $37 billion this year. Thanks.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: Sure, yes. So, Tim, I gave you some color on the first half/second half for us a little bit. I'll give you a little more specific to your question. I don't know that the industry is running at quite $44 billion now. And our model was to get 25.5% market share in 2019. We think we're well on track to that. I'm not sure we're at that point right now, so in terms of the mathematics, it's a little bit different. Further, what I'll say to you is that the stuff I said to you earlier would imply the first half is strong. I don't disagree with that. But what I will also tell you is that we have seen the Q3 and Q4 numbers for us firm up as we go month by month the last few months. So my take on it, 2017 is a strong year. It's going to be a particularly strong year for Applied as we gain more share and display does well for us. We also think that 2018, 2019 we see growth drivers that are really good for us and the industry the next couple years. Will the second half be as strong as the first half? I'm not sure it is, but the overall trends are positive.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Gary, some investors are still skeptical on China spending coming in 2018. Can you just provide a bit more color or details on how your engagements are going with Chinese domestic projects?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Sure, let me give you some color on China. So what we're looking at in 2017 for China for Applied Materials is up versus 2016, maybe something like 10% up overall for us. And if you look at 2017 versus 2015, it's up maybe an additional $1 billion overall. Semi is slightly lower in that mix. Display is higher and service is higher. If you look at 2015 versus 2017, we've had 2x growth or anticipating 2x growth in semi revenue and about 50% growth in service and display. And China is really one of our strongest regions both with the multinational companies and the domestic companies there. And as we spend a lot of time and we have very deep relationships with the companies that are there, basically what we hear is that there is a big strategic drive in investment in China. There's a big gap in terms of domestic supply versus demand, and then there's also a drive to build a secure supply chain. So I think all of us see announcements and very large investments over the next several years in China. In talking to those customers, they I believe understand that this is a long-term strategy. They have Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3. And in the beginning, those investments aren't going to be as efficient, especially in the more advanced technologies. But what I would say is that very consistently we see strong drive from a strategic perspective for increased investment in China, and really what we're seeing is 2018 and beyond a significant increase. Again, we increased semi revenue 2x from 2015 to 2017. If you ask me, what do I think 2017 to 2019, that's going to be up a significant amount in semiconductor opportunity.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Atif.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Chin of UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hi, Gary and Bob, nice quarter and guidance too. I have a follow-up question on the display order guidance. Can you share, Gary, how much of the display orders this year, the $2 billion likely come from the Chinese display customers? Because I know we're all waiting for domestic China's semiconductor spend to happen. But can sales to China's display customers bridge us over until the domestic spend of CapEx happens in China next year?
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: I'll start. We're pulling up some slides to help us. So total bookings this year will be over $2 billion in display. We see a lot of the big orders out of China for TVs in particular and some for mobile. So this is the wrong slide. So the numbers are large numbers for China this year. I'd say the majority of the display stuff is probably China. China revenue, okay, so the majority of the $2 billion, my guess – I'm looking for the slide, frankly, is probably of the display bookings, probably half or more is China.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I also had a display question. So, Bob, if you look at last year, you did about $2 billion in bookings and about $1 billion in revenue. Should we expect that gap to close as you roll forward with new products and OLED gets more traction, or do you think the book to revenue is going to still have a lag effect here? And along the same path, what percentage of your bookings or revenue last year was OLED versus traditional displays? Thank you.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: So your question is the book-to-bill, what's it going to stay for display, and then how much was OLED? I guess that's the question.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That's right, yes.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: So last year we booked over $2 billion. And we billed – now remember, we moved the web business in there and the service upgrade business, and we billed about 55% of that. This year we're going to book over $2 billion, but we'll bill a higher percentage of that. It's still going to be north of one. In terms of the outlook beyond 2017 – 2018, we're continuing strong book-to-bill – continuing strong bookings, but the book-to-bill narrows. Last year it was 1.6 or 1.7 or something like that. It was a big number, so that's going to trend down over time. But it will stay positive for a while.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Krish.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: OLED was – if you look at last year, OLED booking – mobile bookings were 65% of the total. And of the mobile piece, which was 65%, the majority of that was OLED.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the solid execution. I think in the prior question you answered, you talked about 50% roughly of your bookings for flat-panel being China-focused. I'm assuming most of this is large screen. But if we look at the Tier 2 OLED players in China, these guys are trying to play catch-up to the leaders in the market. Our research indicates that China is probably going to account for about 30% of the OLED CapEx spend in 2018, which is up significantly from this year's mix levels. So I'm just wondering if you guys are starting to see this trend and just wondering if this is already starting to show up in the order books or the backlog. Or is that still on the come?
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yes, it's true. So you've got a couple questions there. You've got the China question and the OLED proliferation question. So if you look at China, as I said earlier, we sell for TV and mobile. TV is pretty big in China this year. But drilling into your question more around OLED and mobile, as we said on the call last time, I think we repeated it this time, we had orders from 10 different OLED manufacturers in the last year, predominantly in the last couple of quarters. Nine of those are for mobile phones, one was a lighting guy. So if you look at the mobile guys, it's proliferating such that beyond the number one leader in OLED, we think that in 2017 our orders for OLED mobile is going to be probably over half from the followers, not just in China though.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. It looked like you made nice progress on the operating margin on the display side. Can you talk about where that can go? And can you remind us where that business stands on gross and operating margins versus the semi business? Thank you.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: Sure. We did make nice progress on the display business. So if you go look at it, we're up significantly this year on the operating margins for display in the quarter in particular. We think the year is going to be up a fair amount year on year. We're well on track to hit the margins in the model in display FY 2019. Not every quarter is going to be exactly the same in display. My guess is Q2 may not be quite as high as Q1, but the year is going to be up significantly from last year.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thank you and congratulations. At the analyst meeting in September, you talked about earnings of $2.80 on I think it was like a $35 billion WFE. This quarter it looks like you're run-rating closer to $3 two years earlier than what we anticipated. So if WFE is coming in at $37 billion this year and you guys think it will hold up again next year, Bob, what's maybe a more reasonable range to think about earnings in fiscal 2019 because the $2.80 does look increasingly conservative?
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: There are a few things. I think we'll do very well against that model. That model had a few assumptions. It assumed a $34.5 billion WFE, and right now we're running a little north of that, frankly. There was a $37 billion model we showed that same day which was $3.17. And the second thing was the market environment in that model was we assumed that the display equipment spending was going to be north of the historical number of $8 billion but not necessarily up to what we realized last year, $14.5 billion. So I would say in market environment, condition number one in those models, I'm more optimistic that the environment in 2019 is north of the $34.5 billion, and I'm more optimistic that the market environment for display spending is north of what we have in our model. So the market is positively biased towards our base model last year, which was at $2.80. The second thing is the share position we had in both semi and display, and we said we'd do 25.5 points in semi and we thought we'd be in a strong position in display. We are very confident of that. We gained 2 points in 2016, up to about 22%, so we've got to get about a point a year the next three years. We'll hit those numbers I think, probably some upside. And then in display, the market, our products look good against the revenue in that plan. So I'd say that the function of share and market result in a revenue opportunity against that model. I think what pleases me as much as anything, frankly, in the results we announced today and for next quarter is the margin profile. We had in the past iteration of the model, we didn't move much on the margins. We said that the base model would be at 44.6% gross margins, and some people were a little skeptical because we hadn't moved too much. We reported today, what was it, 45.2% I guess it was 45.4% actuals, 45.4%. And then what we said about gross margins last quarter was that in fiscal 2017 we'd be up to about 44% in the year. That was a gain of 0.8 point. We now think in fiscal 2017 alone, instead of 0.8-point gain versus 2016, we're going to gain 1.5 points. So if you look at that on the model you asked about, we're probably very comfortable that we can hit the 44.6% gross margin, which is at the $34.5 billion. And the 45.1%, which is at $37 billion, we're probably pretty comfortable. And then we maintain pretty damn tight control on the operating expenses too. So if you back-calculate the guide we give for next quarter, now next quarter is a good quarter, its operating margin is north of 27%. So in the annual models we showed for 2019, we showed operating margins of about 25.1% the $34.5 billion and 26.4% in the $37 billion environment. So at the operating margin we're making progress. And then if you finally go down to the URs, we simply shrink the share count to 1.044 billion. We're confident we'll hit that. So we're not going to redo the model today. But around the market environment relative to that model, around our share position relative to the model, around our execution on gross margins, OpEx, and share count, we're pretty confident that we'll hit or potentially beat that model.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Romit.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Ho of Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter and the projected outlook for 2017. Gary, maybe just looking at 3D NAND and the market opportunity still going forward, you guys obviously have made great inroads in terms of etch and deposition, capital intensity, but also your own share gains. As you look at the industry moving to 64 layers and then eventually to 96 layers, one, how do you see the capital intensity trends for the market overall? And maybe secondly for Applied, how do you see your competitive position increasing as the industry progresses?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: So let me take on our position, and Bob can talk about maybe capital intensity. So as we talked about overall, we gained 2 points of share in 2016, and actually our strongest gains are in 3D NAND. And one of the really big drivers for our company is that 3D NAND is materials-enabled scaling versus litho-enabled scaling. I met three of the top four memory CEOs in the last month. All of them are very bullish. The pull that they have for 3D NAND is really tremendous. And if you look in servers, for instance, and the total cost of ownership and the power consumption, I was in our data center, it's 80% less power consumption, and total cost of ownership is significantly better. So all of the people I'm talking to are very bullish about 3D NAND. Our position in 3D NAND, as we've talked about, we increase our TAM, our total available market by a factor of three. And when we're talking also about operating margins and our opportunities in display or in semi, our strategy is to focus on inflections. So we're winning share in inflections and we're also delivering new capabilities. And so that comes through in 40% of our revenue being introduced from products that were introduced in the last three years. Just in 2016, our etch revenue was up 30%, CVD 33%, CMP revenue up 33%. Our e-beam products, another area where there's a big inflection, the largest part of our PDC business, up 33%. So we see tremendous pull. And as you go to these future generations of 3D NAND, it's really all about materials innovation, how you scale to those additional numbers of layers, and we're in a really great position. The pull that we have from our customers is earlier, deeper, and broader than we've ever seen in the past. And Bob can talk maybe about the capital intensity.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: On 3D NAND?
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: Yeah.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: So what was your comparison, again, Patrick, which to which, which layer to which layer? I'll see if I can fill in. So the capital intensity for 3D NAND if you go from planar to, say, 50 layers, the total CapEx is about $3.5 billion on planar, and 48 layers it's about $5 billion for greenfield. Now I think the thing that's interesting is if we go from a planar reuse to a 50-layer or 48-layer, the total CapEx to upgrade is $2.6 billion, $3.2 billion, almost the same as the opportunity in planar at $3.5 billion. Now what's really interesting for a company like us, materials is very etch and deposition-intensive. Now what's particularly interesting for Applied Materials additionally to that, to be frank, one, we didn't have the products or incumbent positions at the planar position, so the level of reuse for Applied is very low. And you can see in our share gains, which have really been driven in etch, CVD, and some in CMP, is around the share gains we have made within etch, CVD, and CMP around some of these conversions from planar to 3D NAND, and also some on DRAM. So one, total spend is bigger. Two, it's really etch and deposition-intensive. And three, it's been really good for Applied Materials within those products in the transition.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question from Edwin Mok of Needham. Your line is open.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Operator, we're not hearing Edwin.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Sorry about that. So I want to ask you guys about foundry logic. Just from your last report to this report, have you seen more broadening of demand in 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer or in the tray mesh? It sounds like you guys got a little more in China. (47:15) And then on IMIS (47:20), specifically on 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer, in terms of optioning or growth in 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer, is it more just complex transistors that allows you to (47:27) demand more of your product because you have such strong around transistor technology, or is it that you expect share gain around patterning at 7-nanometer or 5-nanometer that allows you to grow in that as those nodes go into production?
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: I'll do the first one, and Gary will do more the second one. So on broadening, this has been a year that's interesting in foundry. What might surprise you that of the trailing edge, and I'll define trailing-edge as 20-nanometer, 28-nanometer and above, 45-nanometer. It's 40% in 2017 will be that's those nodes, and you've got 55% we think for 7-nanometer and 10-namometer, and about 5% 14-nanometer, 16-nanometer. So what's the point? 40% of spend this year in the foundries is 20-nanometer and above, so it's really strong. Last year it was about 38%. So in a bigger spend year it's actually a bigger percentage, which is interesting. Now, so what you have this year is spending by the biggest foundry leader pretty strong and pretty big spending at the trailing nodes. And the opportunity you have to sustain foundry spending, which people are questioning about next year, is that we think that in 2018 we're going to have continued spending at the trailing edge. We think secondly, we're going to have a broadening of foundry spending, particularly next year. You asked about broadening of spending. I think it's a bigger impact next year because if you look at the shells they're putting up and the opportunities in SMIC and GLOBALFOUNDRIES in China and places like that, you're going to see some broadening of that. In terms of the leading edge on 10-nanometer/7-nanometer, by the end of this year you're going to have 120,000 to 140,000 wafer starts of capacity for 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. We think that could probably at its peak double. So there's still some chance to broaden out 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer next year. So next year we're not pessimistic on foundry. We think there's obviously: A), the trailing edge is strong, number one. Number two, we see some still significant additions for 10-nanometer/7-nanometer, whether it's conversions or greenfield. And three, we see broadening among some of the customer base.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: So on the share gains, we have, as Bob talked about, I think pretty good line of sight on 7-nanometer and very strong pull for our transistor and interconnect products where we have extremely high share, and we're seeing more steps and an increase in our total available market as you go to 7-nanometer. In addition to the three memory CEOs I met, I also met the head of R&D for our largest logic and foundry customers within the last month. And what I would say is that we have stronger pull for earlier, deeper, and broader collaborations than we've ever had in the history of Applied Materials. And one of the things that we're really focused on, if you go past 7-nanometers, how do we enable our customers to build devices that they could never build before. So certainly we have great pull for new products like Selectra, which again gives designers a capability that they never had before in designing new types of devices. And you will definitely see and we're seeing the ability to grow as fast as we can qualify with this kind of new capability. We have new films that our customers are adopting for 5-nanometer and beyond that also enable them to design devices in different ways. And certainly the transistor, interconnect patterning is another area we've talked about where we have tremendous pull with Sym3 across the board for logic and foundry customers. The Selectra, Olympia, Precision CVD, PROVision, the LK Prime for CMP, we're in the early innings of adoption of many of those products. And as you go beyond 7-nanometer, the opportunities for us even become much larger for these products and other products that we have in our pipeline. So for me, those conversations with those people running R&D are incredibly exciting, and the pull is really tremendous for Applied.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Edwin.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Weston Twigg of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into I guess China and NAND a little bit more directly. A company a couple weeks ago, small cap, said that they thought their revenue from NAND memory customers would increase in the second half, partly driven by domestic Chinese memory producers, so some of these new fab projects that have been in the works. I'm just wondering if you're actually seeing any of that kind of demand that you would actually commit to maybe delivering some equipment in the second half, or if you still think those domestic projects might be more of a 2018 event.
Gary E. Dickerson - Applied Materials, Inc.: We definitely see – we're engaged with all of those different companies. Our share in China is the highest or near the highest that we have for any region, so our engagement with those companies are very strong. We don't really see in 2017 significant revenue growth coming from those companies. Again, our overall revenue in China we anticipate in 2017 is somewhere around $2.6 billion. So for us having something that moves the needle for us has to be fairly sizeable. We are definitely deeply engaged with all of those companies and we look at 2018 and beyond as a much bigger opportunity.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Thanks, Wes.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: All right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question from Craig Ellis of B. Riley. Your line is open.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC: Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the good execution. I wanted to return to the comments regarding reduced industry volatility because some of the majors we have for upstream semiconductor industry volatility show about a 75% reduction over the last five years versus the preceding 15 years. So it seems like for a company like Applied Materials, in that environment there should be certain parts of the business that benefit from increased operating efficiency. So the first part of the question would be are you seeing that and to what extent is that realized? And the second part of the question is there should also be in that environment increased free cash flow predictability. And how does the company think about in a more stable environment, more seasonal environment, increasing systematic cash return or cash actions to create value? Thank you.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: So there are probably about three levels to that question: one, the volatility question; two was the benefits to the operating margins from volatility; and three, the benefits to cash returns. So in terms of volatility, I completely agree with you. The volatility is trending down. Almost every metric we look at indicates that. The long-term metrics or the demand drivers for the industry are much more diverse and sustainable, and then layer on that you've got all these technology conversions. But I was just looking at some data today that the volatility is down, but within Applied it's down too because we are a much broader company. So I'll give you a couple of data points that I hadn't shared before. So if you just look at our revenue split in semi in 2015, 2016, and 2017, our percent with memory has stayed pretty steady at 48%, 47%, 47%. And then our percent that's been foundry has ranged from 38% to 42%, and logic is 12% or 13%. So within device type, we're much stronger than we used to be. And we project in 2017 that our market share by device type, in NAND, DRAM, foundry, and logic, in all four of the major categories will be 21.5% or above, whereas we used to have a 10 to 15-point spread between some of our low memory ones and our high foundry. We've gotten a lot stronger in memory. So the volatility in the industry is down and the volatility within Applied is down a lot. And then you layer in the strength in the service business, which has grown a lot, and the display business, which has grown a lot, and it's sustainable. So I agree with you on the volatility. Where will we see the benefits in the operating margin? We're going to see them in a few places. One, we will grow our revenue line and it will be more predictable, so that results in a few things. One, you tend to use factory utilization higher, so cost of goods sold, gross margins tend to trend up. So if you look at the benefits on gross margins, we are just grinding away on material costs and factory utilization, and that's helping us on these gross margins. As I said earlier in the call, we thought our gross margins would be up this year by 0.8 point to 44 points. We now think we're going to be up 1.5 points. And a lot of this is efficiency, grinding away, sustainability more predictable, less volatility, we talked about. And then I said earlier on the call that we predict our operating margins in Q2 to be north of 27%. So we are seeing it in the numbers. The company is becoming more efficient, more effective with the products we're doing, but also with this less volatility is contributing. We are now, for instance, in our factories looking at being much more aggressive in what we ship in the first four weeks of a quarter to even more level-load our factories. So you're 100% right. In terms of the benefits to the investors, we are starting to generate more significant cash returns. So if you look at the operating cash flow, it was 20% this quarter, which is very high for us in Q1. Last year Q1 was 9%, so we are doing it. Now the question is getting it back to investors. We are going to do it. We didn't do too much last quarter because of some – we were looking at foundry conditions around what's going to change in the tax laws, movement of cash between overseas and the U.S. But we see – one, we are committed to do it. Two, I think we'll have the flexibility to do it. And three, some of the changes that are being proposed in Washington may be beneficial to us in multiple ways, long-term tax going to a territorial system, we're on a worldwide system. So I think it's a great opportunity for the investors of Applied on this.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Craig, for the question. And, operator, I think we have time for just one more please.
Operator: Yes, sir. Our last question is from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks for taking my question. Your DRAM orders have bounced back to where it was a year ago. Obviously, you're gaining share there as well. But can you talk about what you expect bit growth-wise that that could translate into for DRAM? And do you share the view that DRAM suppliers are remaining disciplined in capital spending during the period where pricing is pretty good? Any color would be helpful. Thanks.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: I can start and Gary can jump in. I'll tell you what's encouraging for me in some of this stuff. If you look at NAND and DRAM – look at NAND, I'll look at DRAM in a second. We look at NAND bit growth in supply is pretty much in line and growing about 45% a year, and that's 45% over a bigger and bigger install base. So the end-use demand for NAND is pretty damn strong. And DRAM is pretty similar. We see bit demand in 2016 up about 30%, and then we see server DRAM up about 40% to 45% in 2017. And supply has been a little tighter. We see 2017 supply bit growth is only about 25% to 30%, and then we see a lot of smartphone consumption up for new Android 6GB and Apple third-generation. But what's good for Applied is our market share within DRAM is up about 5 points from 2012 to 2015, and we think we're going to get another point in 2016. So we think, one, the marketing demand for DRAM and NAND is growing pretty healthily. Two, it's growing pretty disciplined, more frankly. Even with NAND capacity additions, what we see is big demand drivers for more NAND. For instance, another factoid I don't think we gave you is that as solid-state drives become more and more cost-effective, there's probably going to be a need for up to about 500,000 more wafer starts greenfield to add capacity to what they have today. In other words, if you look in the world, there used to be about 1.4 million wafer starts for NAND. Now it might be 1.6 million wafer starts. But that's not even enough. Over the next four years, they probably have to add another 500,000 just for servers. Each 100,000 of NAND is worth about $5 billion. That's about $5 billion that they have to add to reach their growth in their markets. So what's the point? Good growth drivers for NAND and DRAM, number one. Number two, pretty disciplined even with the capacity to do it on NAND because their market is expanding. Three, our position has gone up where we've gained by the time we're done in 2016 we'll probably have gained about seven points in both NAND and DRAM from 2012.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Okay, great. So thanks for that question. And then, Bob, if you'd like to, summarize it all before we close the call.
Robert J. Halliday - Applied Materials, Inc.: We talk about a lot of esoteric stuff here, bit growth and materials engineering. When I step back, even more than a few years ago, I think Applied has a really good business. If you look at the markets in which we compete are doing really well, better than they were years ago. Our position is much better. And as somebody answered on the call, our better execution and less volatility of the market is resulting in significant improvement in operating margin to cash flow. So we have a really good business. And what we're doing here is driving sustainable year-over-year growth in revenue, share, and profitabilities. So the three things, as I would summarize again, is one, our markets are getting better, bigger, and less volatile. WFE and display are both strong with positive long-term outlook. We have strong share, as I said, in all device types. We were up in memory in particular. In foundry, we've always been strong. And then display is doing very well. And if you look at our service business, which was $2 billion back in 2013, we're going to hit $3.2 billion in 2019, so that's grown a lot, and that's a very strong baseline business. Second, our execution is better. Our deep pipeline of products enabled by the product development engine, where 40% of our equipment revenue now is generated from products we've introduced in the last three years, we have multiple years of share gains. And what I don't think we mentioned on our call, we have record backlog of $5.5 billion at this point. So that's all around better execution. And finally, the question I just got asked, billing, your return on cash is better than ever. Revenue is outpacing our markets. Operating margin is growing. As I said, we're going to be over 27% next year, and we have a great deal of flexibility to return more cash to shareholders. So I just think Applied has got a really good business when you cut through it. I feel really good about the business.
Michael Sullivan - Applied Materials, Inc.: Great, okay. Hey, thanks, Bob. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of our call is going to be available on the website beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Mike. I’m very delighted to report that Applied Materials delivered record revenue and earnings in our fourth quarter, capping off an outstanding year. In fiscal 2016, we grew orders, revenue and earnings to the highest levels in the Company's history and made significant progress towards our longer term strategic and financial goals. Some of our major accomplishments this year include our highest semiconductor orders in revenues since the year 2000 and record performance in display and service where both groups exceeded all time highs for orders and revenue. I want to thank all of our employees for their passion to create value for our customers and for making 2016 a great year for Applied. Looking ahead, I see tremendous capabilities, momentum and opportunities across the Company. This gives me increased confidence that we will again drive sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond. In today's call, I'll start by explaining some of the key factors contributing to our record performance and describe our strategy for long-term sustainable growth. I'll then provide our market view and describe why Applied has an increasingly positive outlook. I'll conclude with brief updates on our major businesses. After that Bob will provide additional details about our results as well as historical perspective on our future outlook. At Applied our strategy of inflection focused innovation leadership is delivering profitable growth; in both semiconductor display, large multiyear inflections are enabled by materials innovation. Applied has by far the broadest and deepest capabilities in materials engineering. It's our ability to combine these competencies technologies and products that really sets us apart and allows us to sustainably grow faster than the markets we serve. To fuel growth, we focused our organization investments to deliver highly differentiated solutions that enable customers to build new devices and structures that were never possible before. At the same time, we've implemented a new operating system for the Company that's driving repeatable success and increasing our product hit rate. A key element of this is our product development engine. We've already trained more than 5,000 engineers, how to use these methods and as a result we now see inflection sooner develop solutions faster and generate higher residual value from our large installed base of tools. Over the past few quarters, I talked about five major market drivers that are contributing to our record performance today and will fuel growth for years to come. These drivers are leading edge foundry in logic, 3D NAND, patterning, advance display in China. At our analyst event in September, we gave comprehensive updates on these five drivers. So, today I'll only cover two where we've new information to share. Let me start with patterning, at the analyst meeting we said we expect our patterning opportunity to expand to around $3 billion by 2019, growing 2.3 times since 2012. In recent weeks new details about EUV adoption have been made public and this gives us increased confidence in these projections. Our model is consistent with others and assumes that EUV will primarily be used for cuts and vias in foundry and logic applications. That's about 20% of the total patterning market. For the other 80%, we see customers expanding multi-patterning solutions and this significantly grows our addressable market. Pulling all this together, we believe that in the most aggressive case for EUV adoption, our 2019 patterning opportunity will still grow to around $3 billion as previously forecasted. In scenarios where EUV adoption rates are slower than the most optimistic case, our patterning growth could be significantly higher. Looking beyond 2019, we see cuts and vias remaining the primary application for EUV, and our patterning opportunity continuing to expand. Patterning is an area where Applied is making significant investments, and has room to grow. We have already gained around 15 points of market share since 2012. We see strong customer poll for new materials-enabled patterning processes where we have innovated new technologies and believe we can gain another 15 points of share by 2019. My second update relates to display, we announced that our equipment has been selected for the world's first gen 10.5 LCD Tv Fab. The push gen 10.5 is driven by rapid growth in the market for a large format TVs, 60 inches and above. A gen 10.5 substrate is about 80% bigger than the current gen 0.85 standard allowing customers to optimize output for larger screens. In addition demand for our old lab manufacturing equipment is broadening with this strength in both TV and mobile we are increasing our estimate for 2017 display capital spending. We now believe customers will invest around $2 billion more than 2016. In the past few weeks, we have also increased our forecast for wafer fab equipment. We now expect 2016 wafer fab equipment spending will be at least 5% higher than in 2015, driven by additional foundry capacity and incremental investment in 3D NAND. At the same time, our view of 2017 is strengthening. We believe spending will be higher this year with logic and foundry investment remaining at robust levels and growth in memory spending. Looking further ahead, I am very excited about emerging trends and virtual and augmented reality, big data and artificial intelligent, and smart vehicles. These new drivers for semiconductor and display span consumer enterprise and industrial applications and layer on top up existing demand from mobility, PCs and other consumer electronics. Our discussions with leading companies in these areas make it clear that these new applications create huge demand for memory and required major advancers in silicon technology. These trends at to my view that demand for capital equipment is becoming less cyclical and normalized annual spending is increasing overtime. I'll now talk about the progress we are making in each of major businesses. In semiconductor, we are seeing robust demand across the Board, and as we said in September, we expect 2016 to be a strong shared gain year for Applied. Growth in our leadership business is being driven by foundry and logic inflections and also by memory as Epitaxy, implants and rapid thermal processing are adopted in 3D NAND. In particular, we see strong growth in CMP while we have increased revenue around 60% since 2012 and metal CVD where we expect double digit share gain this year. Our leadership businesses are in a really great position to grow. In 2016, we converted well over 90% of our development positions to volume production wins. We’re also making significant market share gains in edge and CVD. Fiscal 2016 was our third consecutive year of growth in CVD and fourth consecutive year of growth in edge where revenues reached a 9-year high. Overall our combined edge and CVD revenues exceeded $2.7 billion for the year. I’m very excited by our product pipeline line in edge and ALD. We’re seeing rapid adoption of our innovative new solutions, including selective edge and Olympia ALD that together generated more than $230 million of revenue this year. I’m also pleased by the progress we’re making in advanced packaging. We have some great new products and based on the positions we’re winning, we expect to double our packaging revenues over the next 12 months. In inspection and process control, we also delivered our highest ever orders and revenue this year. In 2016, we believe that we will gain 20 point of e-beam inspection around 7 points of share in e-beam overall and secure the number one position in this market. E-beam is the fastest growing segment in inspection, and we’re winning new applications that support sustainable share gain for years to come. In service, our strategy is to deliver more values to customers with our advanced service products. Our service teams are more tightly a line with our products groups ever before they are reducing ramp times, improving device performance and yield and optimizing output and operating cost for customers. In the fourth quarter, we set new records for both orders and revenue, and when we look at year-over-year comparisons, we’ve now grown our service business every single quarter for the past three years. Display is also setting records with two inflections driving growth. The first is large format TVs driving investment in new gen 10 capacity. Large format TV units are expected to grow at 50 % to 20% annually over the next three year, compared to single digit growth rates for TV’s overall. The second is OLED where investment is increasing as multiple customers start to ramp this technology and battle for leadership in next generation mobile screen. At our Analyst Meeting, we said that our market opportunity in display is expanding significantly up to 10 times in the case of OLED. We are focused on building our product portfolio to deliver the solutions our customers need to transition to new display products over the next few years. We have great traction with our new thin- film encapsulation and e-beam review products and have more significant new products that will be announced in 2017. In Summary, I strongly believe this is Applied's time. We set new performance records in 2016 and we’re seeing impact of the investment we’ve made in our organization and product pipeline over the past several year. As we look ahead to 2017 and beyond, we see strengthen our markets as large multiyear inflection continue to evolve a new emerging demand drives layer on time of mobility and computing. Across the Company, we’re focused on extending our innovation relations. Applied solutions are enabling customers to build new devices and structures that we will never possible before. This puts us in a unique position to drive sustainable growth and raise the ceiling on our financial performance. Now, let me hand the call over to Bob, who’ll provide more details about our results and outlook. Bob?
Bob Halliday: Thanks, Gary. In September, we raised the ceiling on our expectations for our markets and our company. Since then we've increased our 2016 WFE forecast to a range of $33.5 billion to $34 billion. Our internal projection for 2017 WEF is a $1 billion dollars higher than that and it assumes only modest DRAM investment, China spending and NAND penetration of hard drives. So our early view on 2018 in the longer term horizon is positive as well. So while our Analyst Day was just eight weeks ago I already feel more confident in our ability to hit our 2019 financial model. After the Analyst Day, the slide that sparks most interest was the one comparing average WFE spending and the standard deviation around the average for two periods 2000 through 2009, and 2010 through 2016. What really caught everyone's attention was the one standard deviation fell from $8 billion in the earlier period to $2.07 billion. The WFE industry has evolved since 2010 and that preserves some discussion. I'll give you the major factors that lead me to believe it's a fundamentally more stable and attractive business. First, the semiconductor industry we serve has become larger, more diversified and less volatile. Specifically semi-content was led by PCs, which have multiyear demand cycles time to enterprise upgrades. Now we've added mobility which has annual consumer replacement cycles and generates more semi-revenues than PCs. And today, we are layering on additional semi-demand drivers including big data, IoT, cloud infrastructure, artificial intelligence, virtual reality and self-driving cars. Second, the cycles of the past were mainly driven by PC DRAM, which was the largest most competitive and most generic technology. Today, DRAM is near the bottom in spending. There are fuel producers and the design have been tailored the servers and mobile devices including multichip stacks, it's not longer one size fits all. Third, NAND spending has surpassed DRAM and NAND continues to unlock growth potential as the gigabyte cost approaches hard drives. Fourth, foundry capacity additions tend to be contract base and demand driven rather than supply driven, and foundry has gone from being the smallest category to the biggest today. Fifth, our customers now add capacity on the more flexible basis building out lines and line extensions instead of entire mega fabs. Not only has the industry change, but Applied has changed in ways to give us larger and might more diverse revenues and profits. Over the past few years, we have achieved relatively balanced market share across all of the semiconductor device types. Most of our businesses are now benefitting from 3D NAND and our success in NAND has been a springboard to our new patterning wins in DRAM. At the same time, we have greatly expanded our service business whose revenues are up by over 30% in just the past three years. By 2019, there is relatively stable business should deliver almost a quarter of our revenue and an even greater percentage of our operating profits and Applied is uniquely positioned as the equipment leader in display. We're on track to triple our overall opportunity with new display products, and we're accelerating on display pipeline by leveraging our semiconductor IP including e-beam, identifying new technologies through Applied ventures and securing R&D co-funding. In both semi and display, we can point to specific inflections and winning products that will drive our growth through the model period and beyond. And in all of our markets, I believe we're demonstrating systemic improvements in our ability to outperform. The better allocation spending, more efficient execution and product development engine are now culturally ingrained. Now, what's the significance of this greater stability, I'll mention just three things. First, our order variations now reflect seasonality more than cyclicality. We're focused on driving year-over-year revenue in earnings growth, and we plan to stop reporting quarterly orders as of 2016. To help you feel comfortable with this change, I'm telling you know that I expect our Q1 of fiscal '17 orders to be meaningfully higher in both semi and display. I also plan to detail our Q1 orders on the February call, so you can have a complete set of data for your calendar '16 models. Second, this stability gives us unique opportunity to get closer to our customers and here's why. The technology roadmaps are getting harder, so customers increasingly want to work with the most capable suppliers, and we're the broadest and most capable. Today, our customers are asking us to engage earlier and ramp new enabling technologies much sooner and more aggressively, this costs money. But the most stable business environment gives us confidence that we can invest more in our customers' roadmaps and generate more attractive risk adjusted returns. Number three, the stability helps us deliver higher, more predictable profits and increased cash flow. It's great for our financial stability. Eight weeks ago, we've showed you our 2019 financial model. Some of you realized that we plan to generate substantial free cash flow well beyond what's needed to achieve our share count objective. We regularly evaluate the best means of returning excess cash to shareholders, and we know some shareholders value dividend growth as much as buybacks. We're evaluating our options for this additional liquidity, and we're monitoring the tax policy environment for any changes that could influence our thinking about the mix. Now, I'll shift gears and comment on our performance during Q4; I'll focus on our revenues and profits as compared to the same period last year. We grew company revenue by 39% year-over-year and more than doubled our non-GAAP earnings per share. We increased non-GAAP gross margin by 1.5 points year-over-year and our spending discipline helped us to increase non-GAAP operating profit by 82% year-over-year. The non-GAAP cash rate was a little lower than expected due a favorable geographic mix. At the segment level, we grew semiconductor systems revenue by 42% year-over-year and segment non-GAAP operating margin by 9.1 points. We increased service revenues by 13% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating profit by 1.9 points, and we grew display revenue by 92% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating profit by 10.9 points. Moving to the balance sheet, we delivered strong operating cash flow of $797 million in Q4 or 24% of revenue. We grew total cash in investments to $4.68 billion after returning $279 million to shareholders through buyback and dividends. For the year, we distributed 106% of free cash flow to shareholders. At yearend about 14% of cash in investments were onshore. The onshore balance has increased to roughly 45%, reflecting the effects of intercompany transactions. Now, I’ll provide our guidance for the first quarter 2017. We expect our overall revenue to be close to the record levels set in Q4. Our expectation represents year-over-year growth of approximately 45%, plus or minus 3 points. Within this outlook, semiconductor systems revenue should be near the 15 year high achieved in Q4. This forecast represents year-over-year growth of about 55% plus or minus 3 points. Services revenue is seasonally lower in Q1, but we expected to be up by about 10% year-over-year plus or minus 2 points. And display revenue should be up by about 65% year-over-year plus or minus 10 points. Our non-GAAP earnings per share should be in the range of $0.62 to $0.70. The midpoint of which would be up by 154% year-over-year. As a reminder Q1 of 2016 was a 14 week quarter. Since as the first quarter of a new year, I'll help you with your modeling question. In Q1 non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be up by about 0.1 from 43.7% in Q4 reflecting very positive mix. For the full year, we expect gross margin to reach approximately 44%, which will bring us to within 60 basis points and the midpoint of our 2019 model. Non-GAAP OpEx is likely to be $625 million in Q1 plus or minus $10 million. Our quarterly run rate in the balance of the year maybe approximately $635 million which will remain below the model. Our non-GAAP tax rate is likely to be around 11% which is after model. And we will continue to buy back shares to achieve the share count target in the model. In summary, we delivered new levels of revenue and profitability in 2016, and demonstrated the benefits of the strategy we have been working to implement over the past several years, but this is just the beginning. The industry is bigger and more attractive. Our opportunity set is larger. Our customer relationships are stronger and our new product pipeline is better than ever. We raise the ceiling with our 2019 target financial model, and we are making excellent progress already. Our stronger performance is sustainable and we are confident in our ability to deliver increasingly predictable cash returns to our shareholders. Now Mike, let's start the Q&A.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question at this time. If you have any additional question later, please call the operator and we will do our best to answer that later in the call. Operator let’s please begin.
Operator: Certainly [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.
C.J. Muse: If you look back your or at least what the implied guide for calendar 16 for Q4, you're growing roughly 24% plus, and if you think about mix, next year I’m assuming, growing display, growing NAND. How should we think about your relative outperformance to the rest of the industry?
Gary Dickerson: Sure, in our fiscal year and our calendar year next year, we think in the semi, it’s going to be healthier in general for the environment. We feel good about environment. We’re going to gain shares. We don’t want to exact numbers right now, but we’re gain WFE shares in year in a number of place. And then in display, we see display revenues up significant amount next year. And then, we see the service business continue to grow. So we will outperform the market we're in, but additionally we think the markets are pretty good next year. Our outlook is WFE up. Our outlook is that spending on cap on display equipments is up and service again.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Bob, you talked about the 2017 WFE being up about a $1 billion dollars, based on modest expectation for the DRAM, China and NAND. Can you dig a little bit deeper into those three items and give a little color as to what you're assuming the model?
Bob Halliday: Sure, part of what we were answering that was that we think its wended back into the '18 too. So, if you look at '17, we think, NAND is up next year. We think foundry strong and we think logic is pretty good. DRAM is up some next year, but what we don’t see as high levels of absolute DRAM spending because this year is not too big. What we’re modeling and we might be a little conservative, it's not a big change in China spending, we think that hits more in '18, if you just look at buildings and shelves and stuffs like that. We are big believers China is going happen. So we think we’ve wended our back into '18 based on our few things. We things China ramps fair mount amore in '18. We think DRAM probably is upside in '18, not to mention semis altered form memories we're starting to see early now. And thirdly, NAND might be end of next year probably going to get about 7,000 wafer starts, something about 1.4 million. And we think all of that eventually get, virtually all of that gets converted. So, we think there is still strong NAND spending in ’18.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J. P Morgan.
Harlan Sur: What are the key takeaways from of the analyst meeting was the order trajectory right, so specifically book to bill as a leading indicator of the revenue and earnings power momentum, past four years you guys have had book to bill greater than one, and obviously clearly an indicator of the growth of the business. As you look at your customer and program pipeline for fiscal '17, combined with your view on growth in flat panel and WSE in which we're spending growth, is 2017 likely to be the fifth consecutive year of book to bill greater than one for the team?
Gary Dickerson: Well while we said earlier on the call was that we see our bookings continuing strong, but the relative books quarter-to-quarter in particular we’re going to stop reporting booking after Q1. We're going to you in Q1, Q1 we see up meaningfully and what we mean by meaningfully is up more than strong double digits, okay from Q4. So people have been worried that peaked in Q3 bookings down some in Q4. We see a strong Q1 and we see a strong year overall. So, we think the momentum is still with us, and our revenues are going to be up, and our shares are going to up next year. In terms of quarterly variability and orders, I'm not sure. In terms of book to bill next year, we don’t have clarity on the second half. Here, it's too early first to tell. But we see a strong WFE year share up, strong spending on display. Frankly, it's more strong in both of those than we saw it eight weeks ago for instance period that large TVs are doing well, the gen 10 stuff, the profitability at the displays guys is good. So, we see display is pretty down strong next year, we see breadthening demand for mobile display up to nine or ten people trying to make OLED displays, not the mobile. And then within WFE, we're getting a lot of pull from customers to increase production and shipments. So, we think overall as next year we think we're going to get very healthy bookings whether it's where it is relative to one I don’t know right now.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company.
Tim Arcuri: Bob, I'm curious on China, how much you are putting in? I know that you think China is sort of generally more of a 2018 thing than a 2017 things, but I'm wondering if you can give us some numbers in terms of what is embedded in your WFE forecast in next for China versus what is was this year? Thanks.
Bob Halliday: Well, I'd tell you what’s in -- I'll give you a sense of what's in the numbers and I'll give you my qualitative assessment on the numbers a little bit. We think it's down little bit next year, but the numbers there stays down over the next year, but we think it's flat. So, I think I'm probably conservative on that. So what buried in my numbers is down little bit, but we think that is probably upside that. Gary is shaking his head, but he definitely doesn’t think it's down next year.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, I would say that Applied was strong in all regions including China. And as we've talked about before, it's one of the strongest regions in semi and display. Right now, it looks like '17 is going to be roughly the same as '16, but it's up a pretty significant amount from where we were a couple of years ago. 2018, we think could be meaningfully up above the 2017 forecast. So those were my thoughts.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup.
Atif Malik: Question for Gary, Gary thanks for the update on the patterning with the base and double case on EUV and then on the display side, can you just give us a little different update or preview on what's some of the new products that you are looking on, on the OLED side plan to achieve? Are these products meant to remove the supply chain bottlenecks? Or are they going to target some of the cost ownership or other technology challenges?
Gary Dickerson: Our strategy overall is inflection focused innovation and what we've talked about in display is an opportunity to triple our served market over the next few years. The team of display is really-really an outstanding team driving innovative new products, targeting major customer inflections and you can already see growth in display with thin-film encapsulation and e-beam, two products that we've introduced in the last couple of years that are really generating meaningful revenue for the display business. And so, we're really continuing the same playbook, we're focused on in selections that are meaningful for our customers. We have very strong pull and investment from customers in these new products and high confidence that these new businesses will add meaningful revenue for our display business and increased confidence that we're going to hit or exceed the model that we showed for 2019. We will disclose more about the specific products in 2017, next year.
Michael Sullivan: And then I think Atif has asked two questions, even though I asked for one, and I wonder if you could comment on the EUV?
Gary Dickerson: We talked about patterning at our investor meeting in New York and we see patterning as a great opportunity. We forecasted about $3 billion TAM by 2019, and when we look at EUV adoption we agree with others that the view of EUV is going to be mostly focused on vias and cuts in logic. So when you look at the leading customer roadmaps, vias and cuts in logics is about 20% of the total patterning TAM, 80% of the TAM will continue to add multi-patterning and that gives us increased confidence in the $3 billion estimate that we had at our investor meeting. Basically, if you take the most aggressive EUV assumption for adoption, something like 10 layers adopted at five nanometer logic for vias and cuts, you come up to the $3 billion estimate, of course if it's not in this most aggressive assumption then the TAM could be higher. And Applied is really in a great position to gain share, we talked about a $1 billion number in our model for 2019 for Applied, and we've great confidence in that number. We've already gained 15 points of share in patterning since 2012. We're forecasting at least 50% more between now and 2019, really great products in edge, in selective removal, CVD, ALD, CMP, really-really-really great new products and we've line of sight to the 2019 model with many application wins and increasing customer poll for these innovative new products.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.
Stephen Chin: So, I've a follow-up question on your 2017 view on foundry logic WFE, does your 2017 view assume will be much foundry logic customer reuse of 10 nanometer equipment for the 7 nanometer node? Or is it assumed limited equipment reused by foundry logic? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Sure, let me -- we've had a couple of questions and peak questions and let me give you some context on how we look at the business, and then I'll answer specific question, Stephen. We actually really believe three things. One, that the industry is growing more-and-more attractively in which we compete, total spending is trending up, and volatility is trending down in both WFE and in capital spending for displays. Secondly, Applied I think is trending up in terms of the breadth of our product offerings and reduced volatilities. We've the similar share across NAND, foundry, DRAM, and logic. We're gaining share. We've a deep product pipeline. So, I think the second thing is the trend is the industry is looking good. The trend is Applied is becoming more-and-more attractive and less volatile. And third, those things combined produced very predictable cash flow, which we could talk about later on the call, gives us opportunity to return cash to investors. In terms of risk that there's some replacement reused in 10 and 7 in next year. I think it's pretty moderate frankly. I think 10 is not going to be a big node. I think people are going to rush to go to 7, but 10 nanometer devices are shipping next year, 7 the year after. So the ability to migrate equipment is somewhat limited. The second thing is the comparison and everybody always gives us the 20 to 16 flash 14 migrations that would distinct in a couple ways. One you had the biggest consumers of computer chips in the world switch from one vendor to another in a node. And secondly, you have gone for the last planar of FinFET device to -- last planer to first FinFET, which really made the last device unattractive. So is it going to be reused sometime equipment from 10 to 7? Yes, so I don’t think its next year and I think it's going to be much smoother than it was in '15?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America.
Krish Sankar: I'll make a two part question Bob. One as you mentioned the business is getting more seasonal versus cyclical, when you look at the order trend, you had dip in orders for semis in the October quarter. Is that the seasonality you are talking about on a go forward basis and along the same pattern you look in to calendar '17. Can you help us understand dig a little more deeper in how the WFE profile looks like first half versus second half for NAND, DRAM, foundry and logic?
Bob Halliday: Yes, I do believe that as we said on the call, the previous part of the call, I do think it's more seasonal than cyclical. We have a lot of data that shows that some friends even if you look as we said, the script we got asked the most questions about at the Analyst Day was this average WFE spending since 2010 is up to like 31.7 billion. I think it is with the volatility about 2.8 versus 2009, it was like 25.5 with a volatility of 8 billion. I'll give you more details on that. If you look at memory as a sum because virtually every customer makes DRAM and NAND, the average before 2010 one standard deviation, one sigma was 6 billion on an average spent of 10.7. Since 2010, its $3 billion standard deviation on an average spent of 12 when you put DRAM and NAND together. The second thing is virtually every year there is 2012 I think it is, it’s a pretty much 1 billion to 2 billion every year total memory spending. Now if you get loss in the weeds between DRAM and NAND, it's all different. But the companies manage their budget that way. They still got to put DRAM this year and NAND in that year, RAM fab this year the other fab next year. And then on foundry, foundry spending before 2010, it was $2 billion on an average, if the standard deviation was 2 billion FinEET was 1.5 billion on the spent of 12 brand, and the spend pre-2010 average 4.5. So the magnitude of these standard deviations the volatility is going down, really it's seasonally not cyclical. In terms of to your specific question about I guess this was about next year, we are not exactly sure, I'll give us some data for us. We think our Q1 bookings were up. We think our year WFE is up. We think our share is up. Just because the data, we think year-over-year it’s a chance that every quarter year-over-year is up. So I think in terms of the seasonality specifically asked on foundry. Historically spending on WFE and foundry, foundry is the one to tend to be a little more seasonal because it's Christmas and Chinese New Year. They historically are taking equipment more March through August, end of February through August. And then they might have another spur if they need more latter in the year. This year it was a little different because one of the big foundry customers is trying to more level low themselves and get head start on 10 nanometer. So we have little bit different cycle in terms of spending because remember 10 NAND is shipping from next year. And then the other thing in May this year little different is, there is just sustained demand for 3D NAND. So we had started at the beginning of year, we have a pull at the end of the year. So the seasonal which is kind of more cyclicality is being mapped to be a technology transition, which is very helpful too. And again that’s not so much cyclical, it’s more of technology trend that’s going to go in for years.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad: My first question is regarding the Jan quarter orders outlook, on the prior call you had kind of indicated that orders would flattish in the Jan quarter from October. I just want to understand like what has improved and how do you see the orders can buy different segment evidence as switching?
Gary Dickerson: I’m trying get up my borders bad habit, but I'll try to help a little bit. What we said last quarter to make, we a put a floor because we have spiked up a lot in every metric you can measure last few quarter, orders, revenue EPS. We want to give people a sense. We’re going to continue strong that our share gains, our revenue growth our operating margin expansion was sustainable. So what we said last quarter was, hey, orders are not going to fall for cliff. The numbers are going to start with three in the next two quarters Q4, and Q1, and in fact they will start with the three and in fact the three was a little bit lot of -- we thought it will be little higher in Q4. And some of those one in the Q1, so we think we’re up double digits in Q1. So, it’s prior a little bit timing and the magnitude is quite little stronger because where we’re getting pull is on some flash devices like that 3D NAND. So, it’s strong and it’s probably stronger even thought 2 months ago.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Romit Shah from Nomura Securities.
Romit Shah: It just seems that AI machine learning and self-driving car adoption coming along a lot of faster than we thought at the start of the year. And we know these applications are iterative and very compute intensive. And I’m wondering, if this could be, all this could be an incremental driver next year for your memory and logic businesses?
Gary Dickerson: I don’t about next year but I would say that we’re definitely increasingly bullish about the longer term. We’ve talked about five drivers in our model between now and 2019. This multiyear way, so we’re very confident in those drivers, and we’ve talked about that in the prepared remarks. But I would say definitely increasingly bullish relative to the longer term opportunity, as we’re engaged with some of the leading technology companies, around cognitive computing, smart vehicles you saw, big announcement from Samsung this week with an $8 billion acquisition. There is incredible amount of money being spent. And when you look at these drivers, VR, AR, smart vehicles, cognitive computing, all of these different areas. You need a higher performance computing and we had the CEO of one company that was here recently, and we were talking about logic devices, what are the size of those logic devices going to be? And basically he said, as big as I can build them, as big as I can fit it into radical field. And he was also talking about the amount of memory that's going to be needed for some of the future applications. And it’s much, much bigger than I think any of us could imagine. So I would think, we are much more bullish about the longer term relative to the drivers for high performance computing and for memory. I'm also bullish about the innovation pipeline that we have within Applied Materials. I really believe that the 500 million per year that we've moved in terms of innovation, we are already enabling people to design devices that they could not have dreamed of building a few years ago, and I strongly believe that the pipeline we have now the best is still coming in that pipeline. So I'm really bullish about the market. Bob talked about where we compete being better, more stable, upward trajectory, less volatile. Applied is in the best position we've ever been in to enable all of these great big inflections to happen.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: I wanted to ask about your sort of multiyear commentary when you said you are still optimistic even beyond 2017. Can you talk about NAND in that context and either still very high capital intensity period of planer to 3D conversions and 3D greenfield, you'll get to the point where you are going sort of more layer account increases which is less capital intensive. Shouldn't NAND turn into a headwind and at some point in the next couple of years? And how do you think about that in that multiyear context overall WFE?
Bob Halliday: Sure. Joe. Let me -- this is going to be historic day, I'm going to use phraseology on this in the next minute, it's never been used by a CFO and American Public Company before. All right so hold on. So I have a couple of slides in front of me that shows the demand for solid state disk drive market growth in both enterprise and PCs. So these numbers you can argue them a little bit but I think they are in the ballpark. So, 2015 there was about 12 petabytes of demand for solid state disk drives in enterprise. That goes up to almost a 120,000 petabytes in 2020, so it goes from 12,000 to 120,000, okay. And on the PC side in 2015 it's about 20,000 going to 140,000 petabytes in 2020. Let me give you another way to look at those. Our estimates that the penetration across all PCs including workstation, no parks in 2015 was 21.8% and was only 15% 2014, up to 31.6% of those have solid state disk drives going to 77.5% in 2020. And if you go and look at the enterprise servers, this year it's about 20%, it was 14% of all in 2014 which is going to 26% in 2020. So, again the total petabytes, I'll use that word again, is going up over 100,000 petabytes from 2016 to 2020 in each PCs and enterprise. So the demand is there, they are expanding the addressable market for NAND. So other data I have seen is that for servers alone you might have to have 500,000 wafer starts of capacity and your average NAND effective 100,000 of cost about $5 billion or $6 billion, so that's about $25 billion to $30 billion, and upgrades are about another $25 billion to $30 billion. So, you could have $50 billion to $60 billion of spending and that's across caliber right now over the next sort of five years maybe, 2020 type data four or five years. So if you take it over four years, that's like you're going to be 50 billion net sales. So it's over 10 billion a year, so we've upped this year's forecast, next year we're over I think 11 in change. And I'm not sure it doesn't stay at 10 billion and more for a few years to come because we kind of look at the end user demand for solid state disk drives penetrating hard disk drives by market. We're looking at capital intensity and we're getting feedback from customers. And in the short term, this shipping every day can build. So what's the point, I think the NAND build out on for while and I think people underestimating it because the other thing is they're going to convert to 2D to 3D because they're not going to sell the 2D, and that'll drive down to sell even more 3D and hit cost points at even with the hard disk drives even faster. So I think there's a bunch evasion to get a number that could be 10 billion for a while.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Joe.
Bob Halliday: And I'd like to say that I was proud to use the word petabytes today.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho: Bob maybe if you can just clarify again the growth that you're expecting in total display spending in 2017, is that incrementally because of the gen 10.5 build out that you're seeing or are you also anticipating a further increase in OLED spending next year?
Bob Halliday: I think we're seeing a few things, in actual spending, I think probably we're up -- we've slide on that. I think we're up probably more in TVs versus what we thought two months ago. We think that there's huge demand for OLED for mobile, the question is how much -- how fast can they ramp it? I mean I think its question of supply more than demand. I think TV, they can ramp the big TVs and they're going to ramp up pretty aggressively particularly in China, this gen 10.5 is ramping is going to be more to come after that. So we're up to over 16.5 next year for display CapEx. I don't have the numbers from two months ago but to grow is in both. But I think the thing is bigger in two months for us is the TV because the TV sizes are coming bigger than we thought, the individual TV sizes; and the profitability is quite strong in the TV panel business, which is a leading indicator of spending, and then these big fabs. So I think they both are very healthy, but I think the increase is based probably more on the TV side.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham.
Edwin Mok: My question is on the DRAM side, Bob you sound a little more conservative on DRAM, but we're seeing here pricing improved and some talk about customer looking into moving to next node. Are you just being conservative or have you -- what are you doing for the customer and how you seeing signs that give you start moving onto your next node?
Bob Halliday: We can do DRAMs up next year, but we think most customers who make DRAM and NAND are setting a priority on NAND right now because they're seeing an expansion in their addressable market for NAND, number one. And number two; it's a competitive situation that they don't want to miss that growing market. In DRAM, their pricing is pretty good, so I think the capital goals will go to NAND.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerome Ramel from BNP Paribas.
Jerome Ramel: I'd like to know what is your assumption in terms of in-store capacity with softer nodes for 10 nanometer for next year?
Gary Dickerson: Our line was quite for a moment. It sounded like you were talking about 10 nanometers and with the capacity at the end of the year or something, so we can quite sure.
Q - Jerome Ramel: Yes.
Gary Dickerson: Can you please just repeat thank you.
Jerome Ramel: Yes, can you share with us what is your assumption for the 10 nanometer node capacity that you have at the end of let's say Q4 2017 for the industry?
Bob Halliday: Sure, the chart look I am looking at, we put -- I'll give you what I have easily available, okay. The spending in '16 in foundry 59% is we think estimating '16 is for 10/7, and about the same percentage next year because you are still seeing strength at some of the trailing edge stuff 28, and particularly 28 nano is pretty strong still in fact we think it might be up next year. And then in terms of the split between 10 and 7, the total capacity between 10 and 7 is around 70,000 to 80,000 wafer starts again at this year. But 110 to 130 to the next year, I think the vast majority that's 10 nanometer.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna.
Mehdi Hosseini: You sound really positive regarding the demand drivers and you are going to stop providing booking numbers on a quarterly basis, if you’ll are so confident why not provide an annual revenue and earnings target, so there we can better track this multiyear cycle that you are going through?
Bob Halliday: We never have it in the industry and I am not going to start now. I mean, we don’t give guidance out of year.
Mehdi Hosseini: But you stop providing booking so?
Bob Halliday: Here is all we gave you. We gave you a 2019 model. They gave you the WFE assumption, revenue assumption by product, share assumptions. We told you in the Analyst Day that our share gains were almost linear from now to 2019. And we told you that our service business was going to roll almost lineally by year. And we told you that display was going to be going up to that number too. So our growth in revenue from '15/'16 and 19, we think is pretty straight-lined. Now, giving an absolute numbers a year in advance, we don’t have that level precision.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from DA Davidson.
Tom Diffely: When you look to the next few years and all the growth coming from both the flat panel OLED as well as China. What impact does that have on your both cost structure and your market structure?
Bob Halliday: I am sorry, Tom, could you repeat it please?
Tom Diffely: Yes, when you look at growth coming specifically from the couple of large markets like OLED and China. What impact does ramping revenue on those particular markets due to your cost structured margin structure overtime?
Bob Halliday: I'll give a shot. In terms of -- okay, if you want to look at cost structures APPLIED, most of our sales are related to physical products resale and they share common factories, which are predominantly in Singapore and U.S. The material cost, product cost is similar and then Taiwan is a big source for our displays. So material cost structures and supply chains are worldwide, so where we sell them doesn’t matter too much for us. In terms of differentiation and mix which sometimes drive gross margin, different device type customers use different mix of our hardware and products. In terms of OLED, we look at the OLED display market for our existing products as being similar margin profiles to our TV markets and by regions summer. The opportunity for us in margin is the new products, we're going to be introducing in next couple of years in display, which we think of very highly differentiated and very attractive product which have upside for us. In terms of margins by region, it goes predominantly to mix of products. But historically, we provide a high level of service to customers in China and so we usually do well in terms of share there in particular.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, the incremental operating profit, if we look at China is pretty good for us. We have a very strong position nearly great relationships and then really great teams supporting customers both multinationals and the domestic companies and also the incremental profit for us in display is positive for the company overall.
Michael Sullivan: And then operator, I think we have time for just one more question please.
Operator: Certainly, our final question for today comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone.
Jagadish Iyer: Bob, I'm just trying to reconcile on the flash segment. We had a good spending this year, but why we're your orders essentially flat between fiscal 2015 fiscal 2016. I understand its fiscal year, but what does it mean for 2017. I mean fiscal 2017 given the spending that you are seeing for the flash? Thanks.
Bob Halliday: We had one particular customer in 2015 that gave us orders pretty far and advance because they want to lock in capacity deliveries from us. So, I think that was the aberration. I think the trend line is up, if you look at total WFE, it's up for just flash; and if you look at our sales are up and probably they are up next year too. So we're little bit in 2015 one particular customer and particular want to get in to their pipeline in terms of the queue for production.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Jagdish for your question and Bob would like to summarize before we close the call.
Bob Halliday: Sure, it seems like a year ago but we only had Analyst Day about six weeks ago here little more in the New York, and I have to say even in the last eight to nine weeks, I increasingly believe that the industry we serve are becoming more and more attractive than growing, and more diverse and less volatile. Gary talked about some of the demand drivers for our customers whether it's autonomous cars, it's virtual reality, it's AI big data. You really feel that's been driving the Silicon Valley. You see it everywhere. We had some of the CEOs of these companies coming and talk to us and it's real, it's happening. Look at some of the highest performing stocks in the states this year, that's what driving them. So one, the industries we serve and displays also that way were just kind of doubled in terms of spending and becoming more and more attractive and more demand drivers will predict the less volatile for us. Second Applied is performing better, I think we are more and more becoming more and more innovative and executing better in this compounding benefits from that. So, I think that's resulting in a broad range of opportunities. Our biggest promise is just picking and choosing among good opportunities at this point. So Applied is becoming more broader, more diverse and less volatile, and more predictably we're going to do better. Alright. And then finally, those two things combined and potential with tax legislation that there is really good opportunity to return superior cash returns to investors including which we've said I think we said earlier today that we we're conservative in the financial moving a lot, and we showed eight weeks ago in terms of the cash and we kept a little conservatives within the cash and the model because we were wanted to be opportunistic, if the world tax slot changes that we could return even greater return to the investors. So I think the industry is becoming more diverse and less volatile and more attract in terms of growth, more drivers. Applied is becoming that way and the leverage down to the cash line especially, if you get some tax legislation less attractive is pretty powerful combination for Applied.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Okay, thanks Bob. And we’d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. So thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I’m very pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered record earnings in Q3. And with our orders also at an all-time high, I’m confident that we can beat this earnings record again in our fourth quarter. I want to thank our employees for all their hard work that has contributed to these outstanding results and their passion to keep raising the bar. I’ll start today by outlining the key factors supporting these record levels of performance and describe how our strategy positions Applied for sustainable long-term growth. I’ll also share our latest view on our markets in detail why Applied has a positive outlook for 2017 and beyond. I’ll conclude with brief updates on each of our major businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our results and outlook. In both semiconductor and display, we see dramatic advances in technology taking place. We are in the early stages of large multi-year industry inflections that are driving growth in our business today and creating new opportunities for the future. First, foundry and logic customers are making significant innovations in transistor and interconnect for 10 and 7-nanometer devices. This plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses, including Epi, PVD, Implant, CMP and RTP, where we lead the industry with our unique capabilities and high market share. As customers move to 10-nanometer technology, the available market for these leadership businesses grows by around 25% compared to the previous node. The second key inflection is 3D NAND. This is a materials-enabled technology that significantly expands our addressable market with innovative new products we are providing customers with the advanced solutions they need for depositing, removing, and modifying materials with incredible precision. As a result, we are winning significant share gains as the industry shifts from planar to 3D technology. By the end of this year, we will have grown our share of total NAND spending by almost 7 points above our 2012 baseline. The third big wave of investment is China, which represents an important long-term growth opportunity for the industry. Applied has been working in China for 32 years, and during this time, we’ve established the strongest position in the region. While the build out of China’s semiconductor industry has only just begun, our semiconductor orders in revenue have already doubled over the past two years, and we’re on track for a record 2016. The fourth big driver for Applied is organic LED displays. OLED is also enabled by materials innovation and that makes our available market opportunity more than three times larger than for traditional LCD. OLED is the key for high resolution low-powered screens with faster refresh rates. We expect it to become the standard for virtual reality capable phones and headsets. At Applied, our strategy is to develop highly differentiated materials engineering products and services that make new technologies possible. As our customers technical challenges become more complex, it’s the breadth and depth of our capabilities that sets us apart. By building on these strengths, we are outperforming our markets today and creating a foundation for sustainable growth over the years to come. We are making great progress with all of the key elements of our strategy. First, we have strengthened our organization and processes in the field. In the past three years, we have increased the number of technologists and engineers directly supporting customers by 50%. This allows us to see inflections earlier and define winning products in a more repeatable way. Second, we have increased R&D to accelerate new product development to provide the materials innovations that our customers need. We have a strong pipeline of differentiated enabling technologies that are winning in the marketplace and extending our innovation leadership. Third, we’ve increased our focus on advanced service products. We are delivering more value to our customers, and as a result, our service business is growing to record levels. Fourth, we are successfully applying materials engineering beyond semiconductor. In display, we’re on track to deliver more than $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2016 with significant opportunities for future growth. I’ll now provide our market outlook. In our discussions with customers, they describe near and longer-term drivers for their business that support sustainable growth and investments. These include increasing silicon content in smartphones to support advanced features, explosive growth of data for social media, 4K video, and IoT, that’s fueling demand for memory. And most exciting of all, emerging categories, such as virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and smart vehicles that create new platforms that demand high-performance computing, advanced memory, and better displays. Within this environment, we see customers battling for leadership and making strategic investments to ensure, they’re in winning positions as demand shifts to these new device technologies. This is especially true in memory, where we see a broad base of customers accelerating their 3D NAND road maps. As a result, NAND investment is getting stronger and we now anticipate that spending in 2016 will be 40% higher than last year. We’re also seeing foundry investments strengthening and now expect spending for the year to be 5% to 10% higher than in 2015. While more than half of the spending is focused on leading edge 10 and 7-nanometer technologies. The foundry customer mix is broadening, as investments in trailing geometries increase, particularly in China. In logic, we now believe 2016 spending will be marginally lower than 2015. And in DRAM, we still see spending coming down, at least, 25% from the very high levels of investment last year. Overall, we now expect 2016 wafer fab equipment investment to be slightly above 2015, and as we look further ahead, our early view is that 2017 could be higher. I will now talk about the progress we’re making in each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, we see strong demand across the Board. Our quarterly orders and revenue are a 15-year high. And for fiscal 2016, we expect our revenue will be around $770 million higher than 2015. This gives me high confidence that this will be a strong shared gain year for us. What I’m most excited about is our pipeline of innovative new products. Two great examples are the products we launched last month. Our Selectra system is the industry’s first extreme selectivity etch tool. This disruptive etch technology enables precision materials removal that does not damage the increasingly delicate structures in advanced logic and memory devices. Selectra has great customer poll and we see significant growth in applications at future technology nodes. By the end of the year, we expect to have shipped more than 350 chambers to a broad set of customers. I’m equally excited about our PROVision system, which is the industry’s most advanced e-beam inspection tool. E-beam is the fastest-growing segment in the inspection market. The market doubled in size from 2011 to 2015 and is set for significant future growth. We see very strong demand for PROVision and have already shipped more than a dozen systems. In service, our strategy is to deliver more value to customers with advanced service products that are focused on improving device performance, yield, and cost. Our team is doing a great job. In the third quarter, revenues were at an all-time high. When we look at year-on-year comparisons, we have grown our service business for 11 consecutive quarters. In display, our capabilities in large area materials engineering set us apart and we have tremendous momentum. The major display inflections are made possible by materials innovation and our available market is expanding significantly. We are in the initial phase of OLED investments and this opportunity is layered on top of solid demand for our leadership display products for TV and mobile. As a result, for the second quarter in a row, orders and display are at an all-time record. Looking further ahead, we’re increasingly excited about DR and AR, as it has broad implications, not only for display, but also for semiconductor. Leading companies in Silicon Valley and around the world are making big investments in this area, and our technologists are engaged with them as they develop their roadmaps. We will spend more time covering this topic at our Analyst Meeting in September. In summary, I strongly believe this is Applied’s time. We are performing better than ever delivering new records, and in a great position to sustainably outperform our markets. There are combination of factors that are contributing to our success. We identified large multi-year inflections early. We are making great progress with the major elements of our strategy, enabling us to unlock the full potential of Applied. We’ve made significant investments in our capabilities and products to extend our innovation leadership and we are executing well across the organization. Now, let me hand the call over to Bob, who’ll provide more details about our quarterly results and performance. Bob?
Bob Halliday: Thanks, Gary. In Q3, Applied demonstrated that we are growing faster than our markets and accelerating our profitability. We delivered the company’s highest earnings per share surpassing our record set more than 15 years ago. Gary talked about the strategies that are helping us to anticipate major inflections, deliver more valuable products and services and grow in attractive new markets. I’ll describe some of the benefits that our strategies and execution are having on our financial performance. And I’ll do this by comparing our most recent quarter to Q2 of 2011. I think this is an interesting comparison, because Q2 of 2011 was our best quarter since 2000, because revenue was nearly the same in both periods. Under our new strategy, we’ve increased our semiconductor systems revenue by 23% to the highest level in 15 years. We’ve put our services business on a growth trajectory and increased our display net sales by over 50%. We have significantly reduced our investment in solar, which is down from 22% of revenue to only 2% today. And we’ve increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 1.8 points. We’ve also cut our tax rate and reduced our share count. As a result of these and other improvements, we delivered a 32% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter versus Q2 of 2011. And we did this while investing 30% more in R&D. In short, we demonstrated momentum in Q3 delivering higher earnings power at similar revenue even while investing significantly more in new products for future growth. And today, our momentum is accelerating. In Q3, we generated record orders of $3.7 billion and we now have record backlog of $4.9 billion. We’ve grown our semiconductor orders and backlog to the highest level in 15 years, and our display orders and backlog to the highest level ever. We’ve grown our service orders by 9% year-over-year and our backlog by 18% year-over-year. We’re also making excellent progress towards our 2018 financial model. We’re approaching our targets for revenue across semiconductor, services, and display. Today, we feel even more confident that we can hit or exceed our goal for WFE market share. We’re making additional progress in gross margin coming in at the high-end of Q3 expectations. We’re improving our efficiency even as we significantly increase R&D funding for new products. In fact, we’ve reduced our OpEx to sales ratio to the lowest level in five years. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 3.6 points this quarter to 22.8%, which is the highest in five years. We’ve made further progress with our tax structure. If our geographic sales patterns continue, we now believe that we can sustain a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.5%. We achieved our share count objective ahead of schedule. And we remained opportunistic with the buyback program, repurchasing 9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $21.88. I hope you’ll join us for the Analyst Meeting, where I’ll give you more insights into our progress and momentum. Next, I’ll explain our segment reporting changes. Effective in Q3, we expanded our Display segment to include roll-to-roll web coating systems, which were previously in ES. The segment is now called Display and Adjacent Markets. We’ve also moved display equipment upgrades from AGS to display. These changes will enable us to realize technology market and management synergies. Applied’s remaining solar business is now included in corporate and other and we no longer report ES as a segment. The Semiconductor Systems segment is unchanged and 200 millimeter equipment continues to be included in AGS. Our earnings release includes the information you’ll need for your models. Here are some of our segment highlights for Q3. We grew semiconductor systems revenue to the highest level in 15 years. We increased the non-GAAP operating margin by more than 5 points sequentially to 31.1%, which is the highest level in four years. In Applied Global Services, we set a new revenue record of $657 million. In display, we recorded record orders of $803 million with more than half coming from projects in China. Compared to last quarter, we increased display revenue by 67% and display operating margin by 3.5 points to 20.1%. Moving to the balance sheet, we generated $981 million of cash from operations. Profitability and cash flow management were stronger in the quarter and our year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.7 billion, or 22% of sales. In the quarter, operating cash flow was 35% of sales. Now, I’ll provide our fourth quarter guidance. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 15% to 19%, sequentially. Within this revenue outlook, we expect semiconductor systems to be up by 19% to 23%, sequentially, AGS should be up by 3% to 6%, and display should be up by 30% to 40%. On a year-over-year basis, each of our businesses is on track for strong quarterly revenue growth. Using the midpoints of our Q4 guidance, we forecast that semiconductor systems revenue will be up by 45% year-over-year, with AGS up 12%, display up 80%, and the total company up 39%. We expect Q4 non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $600 million plus or minus $10 million and lower as a percentage of sales. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.69. This earnings guidance represents a new record for the company and a doubling of last year’s Q4 performance. In closing, I believe our momentum is sustainable. Let me explain why? Our Q4 guidance reflects how uniquely well-positioned the company is a major inflections, including in 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, 3D NAND, OLED and the Chinese market. While customer spending patterns will continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter, we are growing faster than our markets and accelerating our profitability. And we’re just beginning to see the positive effects of a stronger product pipeline and better execution across the company. Based on customer polls for our products and services, I believe we’ll have strong orders in Q4 of 2016 and Q1 of 2017. And while it’s too early to know our earnings in Q1 of 2017, I believe we can double our Q1 non-GAAP EPS year-over-year. Now, let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please limit yourself to one question and feel free to reach you later if you have any additional questions. Let’s please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Tim Arcuri: Thank you very much. So guys, obviously, great, great quarter, and obviously big opportunity in display. I guess, I want to ask a question on SSG. So if I take the orders you booked last quarter and I take this quarters orders, it’s about $4.2 billion. And if I use your SSG share model of roughly 22%, that implies that the overall WFE market is sort of run rating in the first-half of roughly $40 billion. So that begs the conclusion either this year is pretty front-half loaded or you guys are gaining a lot more share and that you’re going to end the year quite a bit higher than 22%, and it has to be several hundred basis points higher than 22%. So, I guess, I’m wondering if you can comment on whether the numbers imply that the year is a little front-half loaded, or whether it’s just implies that you’re gaining that much share? Thanks.
Bob Halliday: Sure. Tim, let me see if I can help. In terms of the loading of the year, historically what you see is that the foundry is particularly good and kind of calendar Q – end of Q1, Q2 in terms of shipments, I’m doing shipments and bookings is close for them. And then this year, though, it was later in the year as you remember, so we’ve been strong in foundry as they’re wrapping things like 10 and early 7. And then memory was stronger in the beginning of this year. So if you look at Applied, specifically, we benefited earlier in the year, because we’ve gained share in memory. We’ve gained share in DRAM. We’ve gained share in NAND, and that kept us strong. For instance, historically, the last couple of years, we were about 38%, 40% for full-year numbers for foundry, but we were only about 37% in Q2. We’re up over 50% now in foundry in Q4 and Q1, okay. So what you’re seeing is, we’re betting from secular improvement in Applied, but also some seasonal strengthening in foundry. So both things are working for us. So we will gain share this year pretty significant, we don’t want to say the specific number. In terms of WFE, the $40 billion run rate, I don’t think WFE is that high, I think we’re having some strength now. Last quarter, we said it was sort of $31.6 million plus, and this quarters it’s probably up close to $32.6 million my guess. But what you’re seeing is secular gains for Applied across, particularly memory, strong positions in foundry, and also the China thing is helping us, a lot of things are working for us, that secular stuff is working for us, and also the seasonality in foundry is helping in the next couple of quarters.
Gary Dickerson: I guess, what I’d add also is that in 10 and 7-nanometer foundry, we have – while our TAM is growing significantly, if you look at those two nodes together about 30%. And we have the initial adoption of many new platforms. We’re actually winning more market share also in 10 and 7-nanometer, and we’re still in the early innings of some of these new platforms that are being adopted, the Selectra product, the Olympia, PROVision, LK Prime, Precision CVD, very, very strong adoption of those new platforms. And then in memory, as Bob talked about, we’re gaining share in memory. And especially in 3D NAND, 3D NAND is materials-enabled, not litho-enabled. So our TAM is expanding significantly, and there also we have many new innovative products, including the Sym3, which is the fastest ramping product in history of the company. So overall, this is going to be a great share gain year for Applied Materials and we’re incredibly well-positioned going forward.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.
Romit Shah: Thank you and yes congratulations on the excellent results. Bob, you mentioned that you expected orders to remain strong in Q4 and Q1. Does that mean that, we shouldn’t expect orders to decline from these levels. And I was hoping you could talk specifically around your expectations for display orders seeing them at $800 million here?
Bob Halliday: Sure. We – I think at the end of last call, when we had orders in Q2 of 3.451 billion that I said our orders would sustain and that we would continue to have strong orders. In fact, we beat this order with $3.658 billion, $36 billion, $37 billion. I think Q4 and Q1 are both pretty strong. I’m not sure that quite as strong as we were the last two quarters. But they’re bigger than probably any quarter we had last year, yes, it’s going to be pretty big still. So, it’s probably to have a 3 handle on it, frankly.
Operator: And your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Farhan Ahmad: Thanks for taking my question. I just have a quick one. In terms of 2017 outlook, Gary, you mentioned that the WFE is expected to be up year-on-year. Can you just provide us some color in terms of the overall spending by the transition system in terms of flat memory versus foundry, and on NAND, if you see those – how you see they’re expanding in those segment and also for display?
Bob Halliday: So, this is Bob, I can kick it off and then Gary could jump in, too. In terms of this year, what you see is trends that are helping us a lot frankly. You see strong spending in NAND, whereas last year NAND was about, and I’ll go into 2017 for you too. In 2015 rather, NAND was about 6.8, this year it’s up 40% to 45%, about 9.7. And that is 90% for V-NAND. What we see next year is, NAND is going to be up a little more actually, and is going to be like 98% V-NAND, and our position is very strong. In fact, some of the share gains we’re seeing this year, you didn’t quite see them last year, because last year was about 50% 2D, and our gains are really strong on the transition to 3D. So that will continue for us next year. So NAND up some next year, almost all being in our position very strong. In terms of foundry, we think foundry could be p flat-to-up 5% next year. We think it’s going to be very good for us in the leading edge, and we also think it’s going to be good for us in the trailing edge in China and things like that. DRAM, we think it could be up a little bit. This year it was down 25% to 30%, I think maybe 25% we said on the call. Next year, it maybe up a little bit, but it’s the smallest of our numbers pretty much now except for logics or less, so it’s about 5.9 this year, up a little bit next year. And then logic is probably up a little bit next year also. So overall, we see an opportunity to go up some next year. But it’s a particular place for us around NAND and foundry. And the second thing you asked about was display. Display CapEx you guys don’t follow it closely. 2015 display CapEx and there’s not as good as estimates, but we think it’s little over $8 billion maybe. This year, it could be around $14.5 billion. We think next year continues at similar numbers, maybe a little bit more.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Your line is now open.
Stephen Chin: Thanks. Hi, Gary, Bob, also congrats on the results. My question is on the memory orders. So the memory orders declined pretty meaningfully in the July quarter. I was just wondering if you think that was just timing related, or do you think it’s a function of the more rational spend by customers, and could we see a snapback in memory orders in the October quarter? Thanks.
Bob Halliday: Yes. So the – I think that stuff is lumpy. We still see very strong demand for customers, particularly around V-NAND stuff. So we had a huge number in Q2 for V-NAND, because people frankly want to get in our production queue. In Q3, we have reasonable NAND orders, but not as big as they were in Q2. So I’d say, the demand is still strong. We’re getting a lot of pull in NAND still, and I wouldn’t read too much into the orders lumpiness.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, I think the demand for 3D NAND is certainly extremely strong. Customers can sell everything that they can build. And if you look at where we’re at in terms of that transition to 3D NAND, we’re still not that far along in the overall transition. And so, every customer is moving as fast as they can from planer to 3D. And so, our thinking for 3D NAND going forward is still very strong certainly in 2017 still very strong.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Stephen.
Operator: Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a good quarter. Bob, on the gross margins, I understand that great job from Q2 of 2011. But if I compare it to your 2018 financial model like flat gross margins versus 44.6% at 33.5% in WFE, a little bit below that mark. What will get us – what will get the gross margins higher from these levels? I understand the display mix helps the gross margins, but the foundry mix helps them?
Bob Halliday: Sure. I think, we’re actually making progress. I thought earlier in the year, we would stay sort of flat to last year were up a little bit. Last year was 42.9, we were about 43.2. And this was a particularly strong year for display and also etch very well to. Now, let me just say display and etch are adding a lot to the operating profits of the company. Their model is a little bit different. For instance, display has a little lower gross margin, very comparable as they mature operating margin profile. And then etch has significantly grown their operating profit for the company over the last several years. And their operating margins have gone up a fair amount. In terms of the specific question of 44.6, we said we’d do 44.6 in 2018. If you took, I think, I said last quarter, if you took the mix we had and if you took the gross margins we had by individual product and compared it to 2014 mix, we’re like 44.7. This quarter we did the same analysis, we’re like 44.9. So we’re beating it if the mix didn’t change, what we’re facing is mix. We can offset a bunch of the mix. I don’t know if we can offset all of it. So I think we’ll make progress to the 44.6 next three years, there was a 44.6 was a 2018 number? Where we get there? I’m not quite sure, because of X, but I feel very good about the top line, the gross profit dollars, the operating profit and the EPS of the company, the main issue is just the mix on the gross margin, because things like cost reduction are doing well, our negotiations are doing well. It’s just the mix is the issue. And the operating margin don’t – doesn’t get impact as much as the gross margin with those businesses.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Atif.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the gross margin question. With the second-half with more foundry logic investments coming up with 10-nanometer, I was under the assumption that should be extremely positive for your gross margin profile. So I’m just curious if that is going to be more back-half loaded and into 2017, should we, at least, expect gross margins to improve into the fiscal Q1, given that it’s flat in fiscal Q4? Thank you.
Bob Halliday: They might depends on the mix. Remember in Q3 and Q4, we’ve been growing a lot very strong in terms of revenues for both display and our etch business and memory, for instance. So if in Q1, we probably are going to be strong pretty much across the Board. So foundry, I think, has a potential to be strong. But I also think we’ll be strong in display and probably in revenues in memory, because some of the revenues we ship into NAND in Japan are delayed about a after the shipment. So my guess is a little bit of upside opportunity in Q1, but I don’t want to be too specific now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Hey, guys, congratulations on the solid quarterly results and execution. Another focus by the market on display has been on OLED, but it seems like even in the core or large screen LCD segment, there’s a lot of Board opportunity. There’s still a lot of focus on 4K UHD. I think one of your peers recently in their call talked about three customers that have plans for gen 10.5 LCD plan investments in the not too distant future. So I’m just wondering, if you’re trying to see that in your pipeline? And is it something that you would expect orders for this year, or is this something more kind of 2017, 2018 timeframe?
Bob Halliday: Yes, I’ll start and Gary can jump in. Actually, the core display orders for LCDs and related TVs have held up probably a little better than we thought and it looks like there might be an opportunity there. Now, what’s the big inflection is the OLED stuff. But I do agree with you that the LCD and the TV stuffs held up a little better than we expected.
Gary Dickerson: I guess, I could also add that display is a great opportunity for Applied Materials. We’re still in the early innings and this smartphone transition to OLED. And the display is a key differentiator for mobile devices. So in the near-term, near-term being over the next couple of years, this is going to be a great driver for us. If we think longer-term, we also see large technology companies making huge investments in new areas like VR, AR, and automotive, where display can be significant. We’re also developing new innovative products that will significantly expand our served market over the next several years. So normalized spending in display could be higher than in the past and also our TAM is expanding on top of that. And last thing on this one, I’d like to say is that, really the display is an example of where we can take materials engineering into a new market and adjacent market and Applied is really unique in our ability to enable this big inflection and drive growth. So really overall great, great opportunity for the company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much and also congratulations. Gary, as you look at the 3D NAND market share gains you have made to-date, which process segments do you believe you’ve made the most gains? And as the industry goes to say 64 layers and higher, where do you see incremental gains for the company on a going-forward basis?
Gary Dickerson: So I think the most important thing for people to think about on 3D NAND is that, this is an materials-enabled inflection, not litho-enabled. And it’s a biggest change in memory technology in decades. So when you think materials-enabled, it really the products that we have targeted for 3D NAND, the Sym3 etch tool is the fastest ramp we’ve ever had for any system in Applied Materials, and we’re still in the early innings. One of the things that I believe is that, we can grow as fast as we can qualify. We have so much pull from customers on Sym3. There’s still an opportunity for growth there. Our CVD business is growing significantly. This year, we expect strong revenue growth in CVD gaining several points of overall share very, very strong position in 3D NAND. So that’s another area where when you look at the 64 layers or you’re going forward, there is a tremendous opportunity. The number of CMP steps also double in maybe 2 even in some cases 3X number of CMP stuffs. So that’s another area, where we have really, really a great position. And this is the first time also for us to introduce Epi into a memory device. So there are a number of different areas, where we have innovative platforms, innovative new products, and really tremendous pull from customers that give us a great opportunity as 3D NAND goes forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest. Your line is now open.
Weston Twigg: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just – I just wanted to touch on the logic spending being down this year, wondering why you think it’s down if that’s related to slowing node transitions, and just maybe gauge your conviction in it being up next year, like you commented. And if the softness is related to slowing node transitions, so I’m just wondering if you could comment on any risk that that spills over into the Foundry segment?
Bob Halliday: Yes. We have – the numbers we have now, remember we have in logic, we have a major U.S. company and also some Japanese companies and things like that. So our numbers show, it’s down 5% to 10% this year, and up 5% flat to 5% next year. Let me pull up the detail.
Gary Dickerson: So let me take the second part of that while Bob is pulling up the information on the – on logic. Relative to foundry, what we see is that, all of our customers, all of our customers are targeting 7-nanometer as a big node, very big node. There’s a lot of customers – their customers that are taping out. And so that is a big opportunity and every single one of our customers are in a race to be in the right position as that node ramps. So the pull we’re getting for customers on 10/7 is extremely strong. And as Bob said earlier, we see strong business in the trailing nodes also in foundry. And we see that, China being a big part of that, but we see that also continuing going forward in the future. So, at least, from what we’re seeing today, our customers in terms of advanced foundry and also relative to the trailing nodes in foundry, it looks like and what customers are saying is that, the business will be good for the next few years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. Bob, I think your comments are making good progress towards the 2018 model where you stated, your Silicon Systems business is kind of approaching the size that you talked about for 2018 on the type of WFE number that sort of midpoint that you talk about. So is that – are you doing better earlier, because you’re taking more market share at the TAM expanding faster, could you just talk about that? And if obviously, we’ll wait till next month to get the full forecast, but any thoughts on will that continue to move higher from here on both share and TAM? Thanks.
Bob Halliday: Yes, on the semi stuff, two things have really compounded for us. So and in fairness to us, we kind of predicted, that’s what we’re positioned. But one, the market changes have really come out frankly as we expected in terms of the transition from 2D to 3D, and also the products they need and the transition on foundry has been going that way. And also China has helped somewhat, and we’ve always been strong in China we kept our strength there. So those market inflections in semi and also we’ll talk about display market inflections. We kind of had a pretty good feel for those coming, but we didn’t have exactly the right products there. So we strengthened our product positions in places like etch, CVD, ALD inspection, we’re going to be talking about more, because we think you need more and more of that particularly e-beam, as you get through foundry and logic and places like that. So it’s a compounding of the market turned out pretty close to what we expected, and we have the right products there. And the reason you’re seeing acceleration this year, frankly, is the market inflections are happening this year. For instance, this year you’re seeing a big spend increase in NAND and it’s 90% V-NAND, that’s where the share opportunities are. And we’re seeing a fair amount of spending in 10 and 7, were strong, interestingly OLED spending in display. And we’ve introduced new products in each one of those markets to capitalize on it. So, we’re probably ahead of plan, frankly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Co. Your line is now open.
Edwin Mok: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, I have a question about sustainability of or how sustainable this ramp of multiple areas. And I guess, it specifically relate to customer concentration. So it seems like leading edge foundry 10/7-nanometer foundry and also OLED are big drivers now or definitely a big driver for you this last quarter you said those are sustainable. So I was wondering, are you seeing like broadening or increased number of customer, both from leading edge 10/7 in foundry, as well as got the increased number of display customers are all placing order for OLED, or just still concentrate at one or two customer of those – just that those customer aggressively ramping? That’s all I have. Thanks.
Bob Halliday: I’ll start and Gary can jump in again. So there are several inflections we’ve noted. One is NAND, one is OLED, one is China, and the other one which is going on right now is foundry leading edge, in particular, so let me speak to those. NAND is – there’s about $1.4 million wafer starts in the world, by the end of this year, it’s going to be about 400,000 transition to V-NAND. We think the vast majority of those get transition for many reasons. We think the spending on NAND probably is up next year and our position is strong. And we think that that transition remains strong for a number of years and plays very well for us. We think in OLED, they’re in pretty early innings on the transition to OLED on the phones. In fact, the orders we’re showing that we’ve been booking and we have some more to come, those things will ship through 2017 and to early 2018. So we’re going to see reverence for that for a while and that’s just what we’ve been booking, okay. And we believe there’s more down the road, okay. So this OLED transition is going to go on for a while and we have enriched the opportunity for us by developing new products there just as we have in semi. In terms of China as an inflection, I mean, just listening to the Chinese government, they’re in this for a long-term and their interest in investing in the semiconductor is probably only going to increase, okay, and our position is strong. And then finally, the foundry one you asked about, Edwin, which is particularly focused on. Right now, the leading edge is strong and it’s strong into early next year, and that one does have some seasonality. But if you look at the longer-term trends there and just listen to the voice of our biggest customer, about 50% of their growth is going to be come from more features in phones, and about 50% is everything else that you see in Silicon Valley, whether it’s a autonomous cars, virtual reality, machine learning, AI, all these things are driving about 50%. And it isn’t just one big thing, it’s a whole slew of things. And I think we’re going to do at Investor Day a very interesting discussion about virtual reality and not just what it drives in display, but what it drives in memory and what it drives in advanced processors. So in foundry on the leading edge, it isn’t just phones. 50% of leading edge customers is content in phones going up, but 50% is all those other stuff which you can see, okay. Now, in terms of the other things going on in foundry is the trailing edge is very strong and that’s kind of a China phenomenon, but there’s also the content in phone when you’re talking about all the cameras and sensors and things like that. So I think, foundry is in pretty good shape next year. And I think it’s got probably more sustainability overall than people said a few years ago. In terms of other companies at the leading edge, I think others will need – want to compete, because it’s a big market they want to be at the leading edge. And the timing and magnitude of the spending on that we haven’t disclosed.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Edwin.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Sidney Ho: Hi, thanks, and congratulations on very strong orders. I think, you have two consecutive quarters in China over $800 million of orders. I understand that some of that comes from display. I think, Bob, you mentioned display was half of the orders this quarter from China? So if you back that out, do you feel that the $400 million to $500 million per quarter of order run rate is the base case now and start moving up from here, or do you think there’s still some lumpiness in orders in China?.And have you seen much order activities from local foundries, or are they mostly still coming from the multinationals at this point?
Gary Dickerson: Sure. Well, again, we have a strong semi business in China and a strong display business. So I do display first. We see the trends where the Chinese are heavily invested in display business and want to share there, probably continuing for a number of years. They are not heavily into OLED yet, but their interest in display is very strong. In terms of semi, the government has obviously said, their interest is very strong and sustainable. So that I think that you may have lumpiness, but I think you’ve raised the baseline, particularly in semi and the display baseline has already been going up for a while now. So I think that you’re going to see pretty sustainably strong orders in China.
Bob Halliday: Yes, let me add on this one. We’re in a very strong position with both multinational and domestic companies. Relative to share, China is one of the strongest regions for Applied Materials. Relative to the investment, you hear the word strategic when you think about China, there’s a focus on growing the percentage of domestic content and building a secure supply chain. And as Bob said, there has been announcements around huge investments over the next decade in China. So again, we’re in a very strong position. We think this is a multi-year wave. Certainly, we see strong growth in 2016, but we think it’s a great growth opportunity also going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Your line is now open.
Craig Ellis: Yes, congratulations on the results and outlook and thanks for sneaking me in. I wanted to switch from a more model intensive question maybe two or more qualitative question. Bob it was helpful to get a lot of the longer-term context on the financial performance of the business. And the question as we look at the ability of the company to redirect to some new opportunities like OLED is. Relative to the longer-term history of the company, where do you think the product development engine is? And how much further upside do you have, as we look ahead for SAM expansive type of products that would be on the roadmap? Thank you.
Bob Halliday: That’s a really good question. Let me just spend a couple of minutes, if you don’t mind. If you go look at it, our guide for Q3 was frankly significantly north of the street. I think we guided to $0.48 and the streets three months ago was at $0.36. Now, we’re guiding to about $0.65, roughly, and the street was $0.48. And now we’re saying we’re going to – we have 3.5, almost $3.5 billion of orders last quarter, almost $3.7 billion this quarter. Next two quarters, we’re hoping to have around three each. So there’s something’s changed here. So the question you’re really asking is, what’s changed disruptively either in the market or at Applied Materials? I think there’s really three answers. One, I think the market has changed and it really has in terms of what type of equipment people need to make leading edge devices and leading edge displays. For instance, in 2012, 53.5% of the CapEx WFE spending by semi customers was in places, where we competed. Now, this year we think it’s 63.5%. And in those markets, where we compete in semi, we’re gaining share where we had weaker share. So in the market changes to make leading edge devices they need to buy different sets of leading edge equipment. And frankly, they need from very strong big capable suppliers, because the problems are just getting harder. They’re putting things in the production earlier than ever before and ramping faster. In display, you say the same thing, make an OLED display is harder to make an LCD display. So having the right products, we’re introducing new products. So in the marketplace, there has been big inflections V-NAND devices totally different architecture. So big inflections number one in the market. But number two, the products are very well-positioned now for us. So I can see it is going on for a while. Now, the third thing is, well, how you’re doing at Applied? I honestly believe that we will all grow by several points the markets in which we’re competing. You might be saying, well, how can you possibly know that for several reasons. One, we defined the financial model here right. The spending we put into products is significantly more than we used to relative to our total spending. So we invest more than we used to in product versus just maintain the lights in the building and operating the place. So the investment relatively speaking is heavier in product development and the batting average on new products is going up. We’ve put 50% more technical guys in the field, I think, who’ve invested in R&D and the products we’re coming out with are not not just iterative products, they’re disruptive innovative products. And if you go and get leading edge, logic and foundry customers,the number of DQR positions we have. The number of new platforms we have. We’ve changed the model, the investment model, and the batting average on the new products. And the other reason, I’m pretty confident, I can see the products coming down the pipe. So I think that Applied is going to outgrow the markets that we compete in for the next several years, 5, 10 years, now I can’t see. For the next number of years, I feel good about where we’re investing, how we’re executing in the market opportunities.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, I guess, let me add to this one. The fundamental driver for our businesses today from a market standpoint is materials innovation. So if you look at 3D NAND, its materials-enabled scaling. If you look at how people are trying to solve etch placement errors in litho, there’s a lot of materials innovation that can dramatically reduce etch placement errors, and that’s a big deal for our customers going forward in multi-patterning. And so that’s the core competency of Applied Materials. We’re broader, deeper, have more competencies, more technology, more talent than anyone in the world. And relative to semi, you see today, we’re in the early adoption of some great innovative products, not incremental products, innovative products. And the pipeline we have there is also tremendous. We have great products in the pipeline. If you look at display, Applied is unique and our ability to take these technologies into large areas and into new markets. And we’ve also innovated with new TAM growth. Thin film encapsulation is an example, where we have hundreds of millions of dollars in business enabling the transition to organic LED and mobile. And we have other capabilities they’re also in the pipeline that are as significant relative to growth drivers for us longer-term outside the semiconductor industry. So this is personally what I love about Applied. This is what where I love to spend my time. The company has so much talent, so much capability. I really believe that we’re still in the early innings relative to innovation in semi, in materials-enabled scaling, with disruptive new platforms, and also outside the semiconductor business into adjacent markets.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Craig.
Operator: And your next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. I guess my question is on the gross margin trajectory as you guys see from here for the next few quarters. It seems like a lot of the growth drivers you’ve talked about on display or in CVD and etch. It seems like they might be somewhat headwinds to your gross margin expansion. So can you just maybe talk about what are the offsets of the leverage you might have to negate the mix headwinds and enable the margin expansion as you go forward from here over the next few quarters?
Bob Halliday: Sure, there’s several things. One is the cost reduction, which is the best we’ve done in years. The second one is, we just hammer away at every single product to get better and offset the mix that might be a little harder. And then the third one is continuing it through disruptive products. For instance, we think we’re going to grow our inspection business in terms of market share this year and probably next year, and we have new products coming out, and those products tend to be strong gross margins. So we do have – we have mix that’s pushing back us a little bit, but we have other things that could cover that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thanks for squeezing me in. I have a very short question for Gary. You talked about display CapEx kind of flattish next year. In that context, I see the growth for AMAT coming from share gain, especially in capsulation. When do you think we’re going to learn more about this? Is it something that you’re going to discuss at Analyst Day, or are we going to learn more as those share gains are materialized?
Bob Halliday: Thanks for the question, Mehdi. Yes, we will definitely talk more about display at the Analyst Meeting. And really also focus on some of these longer-term opportunities, where some very large technology companies are making huge investments and where we have great opportunities in display going forward. So we definitely will cover that in more detail at the Analyst Day.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Mehdi.
Operator: And your next question comes from Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is now open.
Jagadish Iyer: Yes, thanks for taking my question. So if I look at your display revenues growing about well over 50% year-over-year in calendar 2016 versus calendar 2015, what percentage has come from OLED? And how should we think about it as we look at calendar 2017?
Bob Halliday: Sure. The revenue growth has been obviously very strong, and the bookings we have, we believe we have momentum into 2017 on the revenue line. If you look at the bookings the share in display, they’ve been probably about two-thirds or more around OLED and about one-third roughly around LCD stuff. So then if you look at the revenue split, it’s probably about 30%, 40% LCD and about 60% OLED this year. So last year was probably closer to two-thirds LCD, I think, and one-third are not too big OLED. And here it is, yes, it’s probably at 70% last year was LCD, so it’s flipped. So it was 70%, 30% one way last year and this year it’s probably 60%, 40% roughly 65%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jerome Ramel with Exane BNP. Your line is now open.
Jerome Ramel: Yes, thank you for taking my question. What kind of capacity are you modeling for 10-nanometer node and 7-nanometer node in foundry going forward? Total installed capacity with start amounts?
Bob Halliday: Yes, so capital intensity 10-nanometer is up over 25% from 16/14. And at 7, we think it’s up again, but we haven’t set a specific number yet.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, Bob was referring to our TAM opportunity, and I think the combination 10, 7 something like 30% somewhere in that range.
Bob Halliday: Yes, I think it’s actually more than 30%.
Gary Dickerson: Yes.
Operator: And your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Charles on for Toshiya, thank you for taking the call, and congrats on a great quarter. You guys, given that you guys seem to be firing on all cylinders. What are maybe a couple idiosyncratic risks that we should be monitoring?
Bob Halliday: Well, that’s a good question. Let’s think. Where we’ve…
Gary Dickerson: I think for us we have tremendous opportunities. The key for us, I really do believe, we can grow as fast as we can qualify. We have great platforms, where we’re totally targeted on major inflections very, very innovative products, where we have tremendous customer pull. So I think the tension for us really is to make sure that we can qualify with customers, work with customers, because there’s just incredible pull for us in a number of different areas. So I would say that, we for sure are going to grow share. The rate of that growth is really up to us relative from an execution perspective.
Bob Halliday: Yes, maybe I’ll pile on a little bit. You always have, it’s not idiosyncratic the macro risk, which I think is moderate, but that’s a risk. I think the other one to add what Gary said, there has really been a change in my opinion at Applied that we didn’t have as much growth stuff being considered a few years ago. So we have really built a funnel of great ideas with customers, customers are pulling for us big time now. So our issue is how do we optimize all the opportunities. So it’s like how good can we be and that’s a tension we have every single day, which projects do we follow up, which ones we push faster, which ones so becomes how many different things we realize how fast. So it’s optimizing the portfolio really.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Charles. And Shawn, we’ve got time for maybe two more questions, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Tim Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Gary, I’m just looking at these numbers and I’m sitting here listening to you talk about all the market share gains. And I guess I just wanted to give you a chance to sort of talk about how this has happened, because was some of this in the pipeline before the Tokyo Electron merger, or did the merger fall apart and you just completely decided to totally reposition the company. And I guess just give us a sense of sort of the genesis of this success to maybe help people deconstruct how this might look going forward? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, thanks for the question. So we focus on big inflections where and I think Bob talked about this earlier. We could see the big inflections a few years in advance and we made a decision that we would shift hundreds of millions of dollars in spending in the company. So we cut G&A a significant amount. We significantly dramatically reduced our spending in solar. And all of those – all of that money we shifted keeping OpEx relatively flat into areas, where we have great opportunities Applied has great talent and great competencies and great technologies, but we needed to make the investments and fuel the growth. So that happened, frankly, maybe three or four years ago, where we started that shifting of resources and really focused in the areas where we knew that we had great opportunities. We also have added talent into the company to help us execute on those opportunities. And that’s really the playbook and I would – we’re still driving that playbook today. So I look at the semiconductor business in the pipeline. We have some phenomenally valuable and disruptive products still in the pipeline, where we have great opportunities going forward. And also outside semi, we have some great opportunities that are sizable opportunities, where we can still drive growth for the company. So those are the things we did. It wasn’t something that frankly with the Tokyo Electron merger, we kept our eye on the ball, we were laser focused on these opportunities. All through that process and we were ready basically when these inflections were ramping with the right products and the right team to execute. Bob, if you want to add anything.
Bob Halliday: I think that’s true. I think you have two-part question there, Tim. One is, how come the stuff so apparent now? And two, did Tokyo Electron have any impact or at the end of the merger have an impact? I think the answer to the first question is, if you’re going to gain share in an equipment business like ours with the semi display, the opportunity is on inflections, big changes in how they make chips or they make displays. And you’ve got to have the right product that inflection or change an older or new OLED device. So you can look at stuff, we even did in the public domain. There were a number of people who said that, we should be less aggressive investing in display and solar. We decided there were two very different business models and so we increased our investment display, because we saw the inflection. But you’ve got to wait two or three years for the inflection or the product won’t be ready. You can’t shoot behind the duck, right? The ducks got to be two years ahead of you, three years ahead of you. And then second what we saw coming was NAND. And in fact, maybe even at your conference in 2014, I thought being NAND at the end of the County was going to be a little bigger than it ended up being, because we saw the inflections. We were betting on it even if you go back to your conference event 2014 early 2014. And we had the product that’s doing pretty well. So now what you have is, these inflections, products will take two or three years to come along. The hard part frankly was bridging this period. And now what’s going to happen is the products, where the pipeline inflections are happening and we have more products in the pipeline for more inflections, if you go look at areas like inspection and things like that. So the momentum is building up. We had to get through a two or three-year period. In terms of Tokyo Electron, Gary forced everybody to stay focused on the business.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Tim.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Hi, thanks for taking a follow-up. I have a question for Gary. Gary, given your background in process diagnostics and control, what is Applied strategy moving forward in terms of integrating the e-beam success you’re having as well as other products with etch and the process reactors we’ve seen Hermes and ASML getting together Kelly LaMar [ph] still trying to get together, just wanted to get your thoughts on how much closer control and integrated metrology can you benefit from in your process and etch reactors?
Bob Halliday: Yes, let me talk a little bit about the inspection business. So this is going to be a very strong year for us. In that business, we could have a record year – our fiscal year 2016 revenue in this business and very, very strong pull from customers. As you said I have a lot of history relative to this business. And what I would say is that, e-beam what I hear from customers is that, e-beam is really at an inflection point. If you look at the changes in the devices, the device structures, there’s a bigger problem with systematic types of problems, where e-beam is the best solution. So we see tremendous pull from customers really an inflection relative to e-beam technology, especially focused on these systematic defects. So that’s what we’re seeing from a market perspective Applied Materials over half of our revenue is e-beam. We have the strongest technology in the market in e-beam. We are the leader in e-beam review. We’re gaining share in CD SAM. And we’ve just launched this PROVision product, and I think there’s just tremendous opportunity with PROVision in the first year of launching the product. We’re already getting reorders from leading foundry and memory customers. And I believe what we talked about before was achieving 20% share in e-beam inspection in the first year. So we see tremendous growth opportunities in e-beam, in an area where Applied is the strongest relative to technology. So overall, in PDC, we have a great – we have great technology, very strong customer pull, and a great opportunity to drive growth.
Michael Sullivan: Well, thank you, Atif for your question, and we’d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. We do hope to see you at the Analyst Day in New York on September 21. And in the meantime, thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we are making great progress with all the major elements of our strategy and expect to deliver record earnings in fiscal 2016. We've are focusing our investments on key customer inflections that are growing Applied Materials today in creating exciting opportunities for future growth. Our record performance is made possible by the outstanding team we have at Applied. I want to thank our employees around the world for their tremendous passion to create value for our customers and shareholders. I'll begin today's call by summarizing our strong results and outlook in the context of our longer term strategy for sustainable, profitable growth. Then I will outline our updated view on the market environment and what this means for us. I'll conclude with a short summary of progress in each of our major businesses. After that Bob will provide additional details about our results and the improvements we're making to the company's operating performance. At Applied Materials, our strategy is to develop highly differentiated materials engineering, products and services that make technology inflections possible. In semiconductor and display, the substantial changes in device technology that are taking place require significant materials innovation. I believe this puts Applied in a unique position. We have the broadest and deepest capabilities in materials engineering and our technology is unmatched. These advantages are helping us deliver the innovations that enable our customer success and move the industry forward. In recent years, we shifted $400 million of annual spending to improve our organizational capabilities and accelerate product development. Today, these investments are creating significant value for our customers and for Applied. When I look at our results and outlook, there are five key drivers of our performance I'd like to highlight. First, in semiconductor, our leadership businesses are delivering key enabling technology for logic and foundry customers. These businesses have high market share and highly differentiated products and are benefiting from robust levels of foundry investment in the second half of the year. Second, our growth businesses are making significant market share gains as the 3D NAND ramp accelerates. Our combined Etch and CVD revenues for Q2 are at a 9-year high. Third, we are very well positioned in China. Domestic Chinese manufacturers are ramping up their investments and multi-national customers are expanding their footprint in the region. As a result, we are setting new records for quarterly semiconductor orders in China. The fourth driver is our sustained growth in service where we are building upon 10 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. And fifth, we are successfully applying our advanced materials engineering capabilities beyond semiconductor, specifically in display. New display technology such as OLED are enabled by materials innovation. This is creating significant new market opportunities for Applied. I'll now give you our latest views on the market environment. While we're paying close attention to the global economy, at Applied, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services. This is because our semiconductor and display customers are focused on developing and ramping new technologies rather than simply building capacity. The inflection-driven investment our customers are making are highly strategic. They are battling for leadership and investing to ensure that they are ready as market demand shifts to these new technologies. In foundry, we expect investment levels for the year to be similar to 2015. We anticipate more than half of 2016 spending will be focused on the 10-nanometer node, as well as 7-nanometer pilot production. In addition, as new projects ramp in China, we see the foundry customer mix broadening and increasing investment in trailing geometries. This is positive for Applied because we have a 30-year history of leadership in China and we've built very strong customer relationships and a great regional team there. This quarter our revenues in China are at an all-time high. In memory, we expect overall spending to be more or less flat year-on-year. However, there are important changes in the mix that play well for Applied. Investment is shifting from DRAM demand and we see DRAM down at least 25% following very high investment levels in 2015. In contrast, we see NAND strengthening as the year progresses. Our latest adding [ph] will be 35% than 2015 as multiple customers accelerate their 3D NAND RAMs. 3D NAND is a great example of materials enabled scaling that plays directly to Applied's strengths. As I've said before, 3D NAND is all about depositing, removing and modifying materials with incredible precision. Because of this our available market at 3D NAND factory can be upto three times greater than for planer NAND. In the quarter we booked nearly $1 billion of NAND orders which is a record for us. In logic, we believe that spending levels will be very similar to last year and when we take all of these factors into consideration, we believe that 2016 wafer fab equipment investments will be similar to 2015 with some upside potential. I will now talk about the progress we're making in each of our major businesses. In semiconductor, I'm very pleased with our strategy and how our product pipeline is shaping up. We made solid wafer fab equipment share gains in 2015, even though the spending mix was not as favorable for us as it is in 2016. Based on the positions we're winning, I expect much stronger share gains this year. Across our semiconductor businesses, I see tremendous customer pull for our latest generation products. In CMP our new LK Prime System now has over 130 units at customer sites. This product is winning market share resulting in our highest quarterly CMP orders for a decade. We are also seeing a broader adoption of Cobalt in advanced interconnect schemes and this is driving demand for our Cobalt CVD systems. This is one of the factors that it's contributing to strong share gains in CVD this year. We continue to see rapid adoption of our SIM 3H platform launched at last year's SEMICON West. We project that we will ship around 700 chambers by the end of our fiscal year fueling strong conductor add share gains in 2016. I'm also very excited that customers are beginning to transition a number of our highly disruptive new technologies from pilot to high volume manufacturing. These include our selective removal products and Olympia ALD System. In service, we are making significant investments in our organization and capabilities so that we can deliver more value to our customers. These investments are generating a strong pipeline of new service products that help customers improve their device performance, yield and costs. We're on-track to grow this business for the third year in a row which I believe is strong evidence that our service strategy is working. In display, I'm increasingly excited about our opportunities and the unique position we have in this market. The major technology inflections that are taking place require materials innovation so our available market is expanding significantly. One great example of this is thin film encapsulation that protects an OLED device from air and moisture. The precision deposition of this film stack is incredibly challenging, and relies on Applied advanced materials engineering capabilities. Overall, we estimate that our opportunity in OLED is more than three times larger than for traditional LCD. I believe we're still in a very early innings of OLED but we're already seeing a significant impact on our business. This quarter our orders in display were an all-time record. To summarize, as I look ahead, I'm increasingly confident that we are in a great position to drive sustainable profitable growth at Applied Materials. Across the company, I believe we have greater opportunities and a stronger pipeline of enabling technologies than at any point in our history. We're investing more than ever to accelerate materials enabled innovations for our customers for our customers. We are maintaining a very positive outlook for 2016 because our customers aren't making inflection-driven investments as they race to introduce new technologies. These investments are both highly strategic and play directly to Applied's strengths. Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our quarterly results, performance, and priorities. Bob?
Robert Halliday: Thanks, Gary. Applied Materials is extremely well positioned to deliver profitable growth this year and for the foreseeable future. In Q2 we generated orders of $3.5 billion, the highest in 15 years. Our strength is led by silicon systems which had $2 billion in orders with nearly half demand. And by display, which had record orders of $700 million. Our backlog now stands at $4.2 billion, and is broad-based with nearly half in silicon systems, and roughly a quarter each in services and display. Our silicon systems backlog is the highest in at least 9 years. Looking ahead, I'm confident that the investments we're making in differentiated products and services combined with our cost efficiency programs will drive record earnings. And I expect sustained performance as we help our customers drive their technology roadmaps forward, particularly in foundry, NAND and advanced displays. We have momentum in services, and we're improving our execution and operational performance across the board. Today I'm confident that we're on-track to achieve the earnings targets in our 2018 financial model. I'll provide a detailed update at our Analyst Day in September. But with the disruptive nature of our order strength, I'd like to give you some insights during this call. We're making very good progress growing our revenues. If recent demand trends continue, which seems likely, and by 2018 I believe we can meet or exceed our targets in Silicon Systems and Services. Through 2018 and beyond, we believe display, NAND and China will grow by more than we anticipated last year, and our positions in these growth areas are becoming stronger. I'm also confident that we will meet or exceed our goals for tax rate, weighted average share count and earnings per share. Relative to gross margins, addressed on our overall cost structure and on optimizing the gross margins within our product lines even as I display businesses strength in this year, I believe we can hold our overall gross margins flat with last year. Over the mode of horizon, we now see faster than expected growth in urgent display. The net profitability gains from this revenue growth should be very positive for us and we're committed to achieving our operating margins targets even with the impact of this mix change on our overall gross margin percentage. Regarding operating expenses, Gary outlined how we are gaining share in our existing markets and expanding our served addressable markets with strong customer pool. Today several of our customers are asking us to develop new technologies to support the Applied road maps and we are choosing to increase our R&D investments in certain areas this year notably in display. As we ramp up to support these new projects, we expect OpEx to increase by about $10 million sequentially in Q3 and stay at this level in Q4. At the same time we'll continue to be very aggressive in controlling and optimizing our spending to invest in sustainable revenue growth while increasing our profitability. Let me give you some insights into how we'd optimize our operating expenses. Between 2012 and 2015, we cut spending in G&A organizations by 27%. In the same period, we boosted the funding of new and disruptive products by $400 million. We did this by using G&A savings to fund R&D and by shifting spending from underperforming areas like found [ph], to areas where we can grow and gain share by enabling major technology inflections. Today our R&D to OpEx ratio is 67% which is up over 10 points relative to 2012. Now I'll comment on our second quarter results. Revenue of $2.5 billion was at the high end of the guidance range led by Silicon Systems. Non-GAAP gross margin of 42.7% was slightly higher than expected. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $575 million were within the range. Our non-GAAP tax rate declined to 14.4% as more profits would generate lower tax jurisdictions. We believe 15% is an achievable rate for the balance of the year. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 was the highest in four years, and the highest in eight years when [indiscernible]. Next I'll update you on our cash returns during the period. In Q2 we returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders. We used $900 million to repurchase over 45 million shares of our stock and paid $113 million in cash dividends. We ended the quarter with 1.1 billion shares outstanding which is the level we targeted in our 2018 model. We've now completed 95% of the $3 billion authorization we announced last April and we expect to complete the program in the current quarter. We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders using dividend and buybacks and we plan to discuss the buyback program with the Board of Directors at our upcoming meeting. Before I turn to guidance, let me share some observations and expectations surrounding our display business. Disruptive technology changes are happening in the display market that will increase customer spending this year and beyond. In the TV market, while there is sufficient overall capacity at this time, we expect additional investments in certain regions. In longer term, I believe that technologies now being piloted in mobile will be attractive in 3Ds as well. Such adoption would be very positive for us. Today customer demand for our display products is increasing, particularly in the mobile. As a reference point, over the past three years, our display orders were $750 million per year on average. Our display orders were $883 million in the first half of this year alone. The growth we're now seeing in display comes largely from new products we've funded and developed over the past few years. Based on conversations with our customers, we expect display order strength over the rest of 2016. Most display systems are very large, and also take two to three quarters to build, deliver, install in revenue. And customers are pulling for Applied to develop new display technology that I believe will significantly expand our market opportunities over the next several years. We will invest an additional new and disruptive products to capture these opportunities.  And while our display orders and revenues will continue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, I believe we will deliver sustainable growth overtime. We will have more to say about display opportunities at our analyst meeting in September. Now I will provide the business outlook for third quarter. We expect our overall med sales to be up by 14% to 18% sequentially. Within the revenue outlook, we outlook Silicon Systems net sales to be up by 10% to 15%. AGS net sales should be up by 5% to 8% and we expect display net Sales to be up by 70% to 90% to approximately $300 million. AES net sales should be flat to up slightly. We are modelling the non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be up by 50 to 100 basis points.  Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $585 million plus or minus $10 million. The mid-point is up just 1.6% from the same period last year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.50. The mid-point is up 45% from the same last year. This EPS guidance represents a new record that is significantly above any previous performance for Applied Materials. To summarize, while overall economic and semiconducting industry conditions are relatively flat this year, Applied Materials is uniquely well positioned. We plan to set new records in a number of areas including EPS for full year. We have significantly biased our spending to disruptive new products and customer support. And I believe we now have a great pipeline of new and emerging products focused on the key technology inflections. We also have strong customer pull in markets and regions that give us sustainable opportunities to deliver profitable growth in the years ahead. Now let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Toshiya Hari: Hi, thank you for taking my question and congrats on a very strong guide. My first question is on the display outside of the business. In the past you guys have talked about increasing your stand by 3x over the next couple of years. I guess my question is how much have you realized already and how much is still coming going forward? 
Robert Halliday: Sure, let me see if I can start and Gary can jump in. what we are seeing is two or three things helping us here. One, the overall market is going for spending. Two, opposition is growing. I don't think we have reached the culmination of our ability to grow and I think that's going to go on for the next several years. 
Toshiya Hari: Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up is on the core SSG side of things. In the quarter you just reported obviously NAND orders were up sequentially and I was surprised to see foundry down a little bit. On the NAND side where are you picking up share and on the foundry side is it starting to assume that orders start to pick up in the current July quarter? Thank you. 
Robert Halliday: Yes, on the NAND business very strong pull from the customers as NAND moves from Litho enabled scaling to materials labor scaling so we see very pull for edge we are gaining new steps and very strong performance. Overall we believe this will be a strong year for Etch business will gain share and certainly in 3D NAND the growth there is significant. Deposition is another area, CVD is an area that's very strong in NAND. We have additional epi-steps in NAND. There are many additional CMP steps so there are number of areas where there is significant growth for us in 3D NAND and we look at this as a wave that will continue over the next few years. So it is really a great opportunity for Applied where our TAM is going up as you are moving up from Litho to materials and we are also significantly increasing our share in 3D NAND.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open. 
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question is on the Silicon front, couple of parts, first one is you talked upon upside potential till you flagged WFEL look. I would love to hear your thoughts there and then as you think about growing Share and Etch, very favorable mix in terms of Foundry as well as China and what you are doing around 3D NAND and how should we think about your growth in calendar 2016 relative to that flat to slightly up WFEL look?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, I will try if I can jump in. we agree it's flat up this year. The year hasn't unfolded as we had hoped last November it's gone better and better for us frankly. If you look at it NAND has picked up, we now think it's up about 35% year-over-year. While DRAMs is probably down about 25%.  Foundry is not up a lot this year, up somewhat but if you look at our position within foundry, it is really strong and then DRAM also gaining so if you go look at our position with each we are gaining share. I will give you a fact you may not have picked up on. Pre-2012 we were only over 15% in one of the four major groups when you look at NAND, DRAM, foundry and logic. This year we project to be over 20% so if you look at the NAND spending at $9.2 billion, our share is going up to probably under 15% to north of 20% this year and he spending is up to $9.2 billion whereas in the base shift 2012 was about $4.2 billion.  So the market is up and our share is up significantly. And the NAND strength goes on for a number of years as you know by the end of this year we are only going to have about $375,000 wafer stacks converted. There is another a million wafer stacks out there playing on. If you go look at foundry, we anticipate being a reasonable year in foundry, but our positions done really well. Whether it's in Taiwan or lot of the activity going on in China. So we are gaining, we are doing very strongly. And then also logic we are doing well, leading into logic so the way the years laid out our positioning of our products in the market is at fastest growing whether it is NAND, strength in leading edge in foundry, strength in China and also strength in display is playing very well for Applied. So we expect within same gain shares.
Robert Halliday: Thank you, I will take the Etch question. So as I said earlier, we think that 2016 is going to be a really strong year for us in growing our Etch share. We have a very strong position, very strong position in 3D NAND conductor edge. So, as that business continues to grow, as that wave moves forward over the next few years, we are in a really great position and we have some of the most exciting products in this group that I have seen in my whole career. The same three, tremendous poll from customers in 3D NAND and also in other segments, we are winning new steps and really across the board for same three so very strong position there and also in selected material removal. We have very strong focus from customers and that business is also growing for us at a strong rate. So overall, we think 2016 is going to be a great year for Etch and again some of the strongest products I have seen in my career. 
C.J. Muse: That's very helpful, thank you. Sneak one quick one on OLED in. I thought your commentary on the TV set was interesting. When do you think you will start to see your first Gen 8 plus orders for OLED?
Gary Dickerson: Right now what's driving the market in 2016 as we said earlier in the year, we sad earlier over 60% in our orders in revenues this year were going to be Mobile versus TV, in fact that's probably turned up to now over 70 now in terms of order rate. If you look at the big inflection that's taking around mobile and OLED, that inflection may come sometime in TVs but it's not unforeseeable to me in the future. 
C.J. Muse: That's very helpful, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen Chin: Thanks. Hi Gary, Bob, congrats on the execution. Question Bob on the comment that there may be display orders strength for the rest of 2016. Is the display visibility from a follow on order to a big Korean customer or do you have visibility from other display customers, perhaps in China who are constructing a lot of new display fab? It just sounds like the message is AMAT's total orders could be strong in the second half of the year. Just trying to get some color on that, thanks.
Robert Halliday: Well I think as Gary sort of referred to the waves, things that are happening for us now are not one quarter advanced, there is several inflections going on. In display it's around OLED, in NAND it's around V-NAND even in the China thing this has been going on for years and in the foundry strength we have seen on severance going to go on next couple of years. So these big inflections are going to go on for a number of years. For instance, in display we think it's going to go on for a while, it's not a one quarter event and we see the concentration in mobile in terms of your specific question on TVs I guess in China, was that the specific question? Yes, we think the display order rate will be fixed around for this year. 
Stephen Chin: Okay, thanks Bob. Just a follow-up question on the foundry orders. Just to clarify do you think second half foundry orders because foundry orders are up in the second half, it is possible aim at total orders remain quite strong in the second half of the year too?
Robert Halliday: We think in our fiscal year, we think our orders in foundry remain quite strong. We think in the calendar year, split for the business we think foundry has second half weighted also. So we think second half is pretty good on foundry.
Stephen Chin: Okay. Thank you, Bob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot, I have two. I guess I am just looking at the upside to the orders and it really seems like it was driven from purely OLED and it looks like China memory stuff, so it seems like you are finally beginning to see these China memory projects move within your 12 month shipment window. So I guess my question really is how much can China add to WSE say next year because if you book like an income of $400 million to $500 million this quarter from those projects, that would argue that you could add maybe couple of billion to WSE next year. So I am wondering if that math works with you.
Robert Halliday: Yes, let me give you, you said have two questions. Let me strike them both. First in terms of the second quarter just ended we were pretty strong across the board in orders. We had a very strong quarter, almost a billion dollars as Gary mentioned. And in terms of the other devices foundry, D-RAM and logic we were reasonably strong actually across the board and display was very strong and services did well too. So our strength was pretty broad in terms of the China impact, the Chinese talk about spending $20 billion to $30 billion of over 4 to 5 years. We are seeing record revenue for ourselves in China this period and it's gone up and our expectations have gone up every quarter basically so in terms of they spend $20 billion to $30 billion over 4 to 5 years.  How much is incremental? That's about $4 billion a year roughly, $5 billion a year. I would say for the next three years you could see some maybe half of it incremental. I think it provides an underpinning for overall demand so that you feel pretty comfortable that next year is probably a good 32 year if you guess because you got this underpinning of good NAND, good China, I think the second wave of 10-7 is okay. D-RAM I am not sure about. 
Gary Dickerson: Yes, one other thing I would say is China is probably our strongest region relative to our position with both the domestic companies and multi-national companies and as Bob said the momentum just keeps building. We have doubled revenue in china over the last 2 years and I am spending a fair amount of time there myself and certainly you look at what's happening there now and discussions for future projects. As Bob said, multi-year wave opportunity in terms of China. Hard to say exactly what the number would be but it is definitely going to be up a fair amount. 
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Thank for that and then I guess follow-up is I know previously you guys talked about 3D-NAND installed target of 350,000 and 400,000 industry-wide actually this year, so it seemed like maybe the industry was going to add roughly 200,000 this year. So my question is how much of that is conversion versus how much of that is Greenfield? Thanks.
Robert Halliday: Sure. This year we came in to the year with 150,000 installed. We think the year goes up to 350,000 to 400,000. In terms of the mix we think ads, capacity ads probably a 100 to 150 converts to 100 to 150 in a year. 
Timothy Arcuri: Great, thanks so much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmed from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. 
Farhan Ahmed: Hi guys, congrats on the great quarter. One question on your spending pattern on NAND. Do you still think it's a first half dated this year or do you think it will go away in second half and the incremental strength in the NAND is stronger in the, is it more in the second half you are seeing the uptake or was it already captured in the bookings in your first half?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, in terms of the NAND split the first half is stronger for the NAND but the second half is pretty good so we think it's more first half weight but does fall for second half, pretty good. What was your second question?
Farhan Ahmed: Just the global uptake you are seeing in NAND, you mentioned the NAND spending is now, you expect it to be stronger than your last quarter call and I just wanted to understand is I take more in the first half or the second half?
Gary Dickerson: Yes we are up to $9.2 billion on NAND right now and I think last quarter we brought half a billion less may be. We are seeing broad based spending, some stuff was pulled into the first half and second half is staying strong. 
Farhan Ahmed: Got it. And then regarding China like obviously it's the strongest region this quarter but even going back it seems like it's tracking to the second strongest region for you guys for a while. I just wanted to understand in terms of your exposure to China how much of that this quarter was display versus semi-conductors, if you can provide some color on that it would be really helpful?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, we were particularly strong in semi-conductor this quarter in China. We see despite has been very strong but right now the TVs in China the order rates are not as high as it was. 
Farhan Ahmed: Got it, that's all I have. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. First, Gary and Bob in terms of the foundry orders and outlook that you have, have you started seeing any pick up in 10 nanometers or are you still seeing like the first quarter, some of the orders coming in from the 28 nanometer nodes?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, we are going to have a strong 10 year and then going to have some 7 also. In terms of the split we think you came into the year with 10 & 7 at about 10,000. We think you would go out of the year maybe 60, some may add 50 concentrated in Taiwan and then if you look at it, what's unusual about this Patrick is some of the trailing edge stuff is pretty strong. You see fair amount of over 40 and above and you see pretty good 28 year also and a lot of that is Chinese impact. 
Patrick Ho: Great. And your shareholder return you mentioned that you are completing your shareholder stock buyback this current quarter. Can you just give perhaps a little bit of update of what do you think you will do on a going forward basis?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, we are going to talk about this at the Board of Directors meeting. Share is obvious. We are very committed to shareholders returns, cash returns in fact in the last year we have returned 250% of free cash flow so we can't stay at that level. We are already committed and we also said in the call we will beat our targets of weighted average share in the model in 2018 so you know we are almost there now so we will continue to get better on that. In terms of the magnitude of the debt we have to talk to the board but we are committed to the shareholder returns. We are committed to beating away average shares in the model and the details of it will have to go through with the board in June.
Patrick Ho: Right, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit Shah: Yes, thank you and congratulations on the success here. Bob you have kind of given us in bits or pieces but obviously just hoping you could overall give us a sense of how you are thinking about second half calendar revenues over the first half on one hand with the strong July guide you have got, arguably a tough comp. On the other hand, I did notice that your revenue growth guidance for July is well below your growth in your backlog which kind of implies that sales should be strong for the balance of the year. So just how are you thinking about second half calendar year versus first half overall?
Robert Halliday: Well, a piece together data you already have just to give you some more pieces to the puzzle. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion and we said in -- if we're going to stay [ph] right now in 73% of the backlog is shippable in the next six months. And then if you look at it on the semi side, the lead times and that stuff typically not so long, on display we've said that the lead times historically been six to nine months, now we're able to increase our outlook for display revenues next quarter because we're trying to pump a little bit in the supply chain, so we're optimistic that display can continue strong in revenues for the rest of the calendar year. So we are feeling pretty good that our second half will be up from first half and it will be well in the year. And the underpinnings that we talked about our strength and display where we have the orders in backlog and figured that strong, in semi it was till we think that share gains goes up this year and as this in semi equipment, and services will get strong for the rest of the year, it will continue to be strong. And -- so we feel pretty good about the second half.
Romit Shah: Great. And then just on display, as the revenues improve how do we think about incremental margins on this business, I think it's averaged about 20% but we know that it does bounce around.
Robert Halliday: Yes, we think the operating margins prospectively for display are pretty positive. Right now we're ramping a lot of things, we're ramping new products, we're ramping production. So we think over the time as we basically said or implied in the financial of the company, the display operating margins for the company will be similar to the overall average for the company. Now both display and AGS have slightly different business model in FSG and that the gross margin tend to be little higher in FSG but the operating expenses metrics are less in AGS and display. So your net-net come down about the same operating margins.
Romit Shah: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question, I have two of them. First one either Bob or Gary, out of the $700 million in display orders, how much of them was for OLED specifically? And would most of these be revenues in fiscal '17. Can you give some color on that and then I had a follow-up.
Robert Halliday: Sure. What we said earlier in the year that of our display business this year, over 60% was going to be mobile and in fact it's probably over 70% now and the vast significant majority of that -- the great majority of that is focused on the OLED market this year in terms of the order rate. In terms of when it revenues, we anticipate as we guided that our revenues will be up next quarter, we are positive out of revenue opportunities for Q4 and we think we'll do very well in display next year too, there won't all obviously revenue in next six months -- three to six months but we feel good about our opportunity on a long-term basis in display.
Krish Sankar: Got it. And then as a follow-up question for Gary, you guys are getting some traction in Etch, especially on the 3D NAND side. Can your current Etch tools actually do 96 or 128-layer 3D NAND or do you need to develop new tools? I'm just trying to figure out the R&D profile on Etch or FSG like two years down the road.
Gary Dickerson: Sure. So let me first also add to Bob's comments on display and then I'll get to Etch. So I really think it's important for people to understand where are the early innings of this opportunity in terms of the OLED wave. And relevant to the questions on sustainability, if you look at the waves that are really driving our business in display, NAND, China; we're in the really innings of all of those different ways. We are continuing to invest and we've expanded our TAM by a factor of 3, we have an opportunity to expand our TAM more in the future. So that went out really, very optimistic that we're going to continue to drive significant growth in display going forward. And then in Etch, we're in a very strong position in Etch to gain share in 2016 and beyond. As I said before, the products that we have; SIM3, selective material removal products, it's almost on a weekly basis I hear new opportunities, very strong poll across the board all customers for these new technologies and so relative to 96-pairs or over 100-pairs we have poll from customers in some of the most critical applications were PTOR/DTOR in some of the most critical applications. So I'm extremely optimistic that we're going to continue to gain share in Etch in 2016 and beyond.
Krish Sankar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joseph Moore: Great, thank you. I'm wondering if you can give us R&D as a kind of puts and takes on gross margin in the back half. I would think that the ramp will display in 3D and Etch in the make shift towards memory, all will be sort of headwinds in gross margin, just -- anyway we should think about that?
Robert Halliday: Sure, that's a good question. We are working a lot on gross margins. Let me give you -- year-end analysis you might find interesting. So the company gross margins as you know were 40.9 in 2012, 42.1 in 2013, 44.1 in 2014, and then we went down a little bit around 43 last year, I think it would be probably about the same next year. I guess we're 42 last year. And so I feel when we're making a traction or not, so I have the guys run all of our BUs and all of our segment with current gross margins by BU segment with 14 mix. And if you take the 14 mix, when we are in 44.1, the gross margins this year would be 44.7 which is up six times from NAND and north of our committed model 44.6. So what you see is within virtually all the product groups, and within -- exercise the cost reduction and negotiation, we're doing pretty well actually, and it is in fact mix the challenge for us. So I do think that as I said earlier, for instance display is a similar operating margins to company but lower gross margins. In Etch we're doing great in terms of growing profitability and market share, it was all lower gross margin also at this stage. So those are headwinds in our phase this year but we think we'll offset them and still hit the roughly 43% on the end as we said earlier in the year.
Joseph Moore: Okay. And can you give us some idea how much different the display gross margins maybe just qualitatively and does that change when you're sort of three times on NAND that you've been?
Robert Halliday: Yes, we haven't gone into that level of detail. We think overtime that gross and operating margins in display will trend up but we haven't been specific on the numbers.
Joseph Moore: Okay. Thank you very much. Great quarter.
Robert Halliday: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Hey guys, good job on the quarterly execution on the strong guide. Getting the personal environment in DRAM, there seems to be more pressure on your DRAM customers to move to the 1X nanometer node. So I guess question here is, are you starting to see of the early spending for 1X in your second half pipeline? And how do you see DRAM spend second half versus first half?
Robert Halliday: I'll start and Gary can jump in if he wants. We think DRAM was front-end loaded, first half loaded on a calendar year, softer in the second half. In terms of our outlook for DRAM specifically, we think it's stronger in the first half than second half. We have speculation about some of that early spend in DRAM but it's not in our line of sight yet.
Harlan Sur: Got it, thanks for those insights. And then on OLED, the team obviously has been talking about $3 to $4 opportunity versus the more from silicon, you've also on this call have been talking about some new tools that couldn't even drive further increase in your OLED term opportunity, thin film encapsulation was a good example of that. So I guess the question here is, are you guys already sampling some of these new tools? And when should we hear about formal introduction of these tools and when could they start to add to your revenue streams?
Gary Dickerson: Thanks for the question. So you mentioned thin film encapsulation, and certainly that's a great example, materials engineering enabling new capabilities for our customers and also growth for Applied. So as you said, we talked about that being a great opportunity and that part of what we're seeing in terms of very, very strong opportunity in display. We do have other areas that we're working on but we're not really ready to forecast or signal when those technologies will be ready but I would say that that team in display is an incredible team of people, they've demonstrated that they can grow in these major inflections and I'm very optimistic that this way that we're seeing in display OLED is a multi-year wave and then I really believe that we have a great opportunity to not only ride that wave but expand our TAM and share in display. So very, very optimistic about that business.
Robert Halliday: I'll just add, the team's done a great job, number one. Number two, the market is going to grow for a while and are going to capture with products we're still pushing down the pipe and look very optimistic it's going to grow. So self-addressable market looks good too.
Harlan Sur: Thanks, Gary. Thanks, Bob.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Athis Mallick [ph] from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question and good job on the quarter. If I look at your foundry orders were -- the last six quarters have declined on a year-over-year basis and I'm just trying to reconcile that with your expectations of second half being better for foundry and given the few sentence you said on the call that 10-nanometer could be a shorter demand node as customers are keeping out more products for the 7-nanometer. So I just want to understand the risk in the second half foundry expectations, is it more China weighted or more Tier-1 foundry weighted? And then I have a follow-up.
Robert Halliday: You've got three questions; and the annual trend going back a few years half of this projections in the next year. So if you look at the trend maybe you're correct that total foundry spending from 2014 was down to 2015, down -- sort of flat, up a little bit in 2016. I don't have 2013 in front of me, I think it was similar to -- here is 2013, not too much total though [ph], there it is -- 2013 was about the same. So 2013 and 2014 was about the same, down a little bit 2015, down a little bit 2016. So that's the annual trend. If you look at the year, we're pretty confident that foundry is strong in the second half based on the timing of the specific summit. Now what you have going along which is a little different than a lot of people were concerned about sort of the dynamic of what happened in 2014 going to 2015 and what could happen in 2016 going into 2017. So if you don't look at 2014, when we turn down to 2015, this sort of had a latent excess capacity, right. You had 28-nanometer business have been purchased a year or two before capacity for big foundry manufacturer. And then a lot of the capacity was added very aggressively in 2014, so 20-nanometer for the same found-customer. So that you had latent potential capacity there that hit us in 2015. And that also hit us a little bit with another foundry customers who thought they could get some of the business. You don't have the same type of dynamic this year because you're in the very early stages of the buildup, 10-7 to the overbuild you had from the previous note, say 28 in this case, you don't really have that as much from 2014-2016. And thirdly, they haven't ramped that much on at this point. In 2014, at the end of 2014 they had about 100,000 wafer starts total installed of 20, then in this year on PAN alone, they might have 50,000. So that would 55,000 or 60,000. So you're in the early stages; so one, it's been trending down over years, primary because of there is capacity issue there and growth is little bit down. Second, is the second half good this year, yes it is, because we can see it. Third, do we have this big capacity issue next year? Not so much because it's different and related to that, an unusually high amount of spending in foundry this year is at 40 and above and 28 is pretty strong because of the China problem. So I think catching all on the foundry, sort of a floor is the China problem with adding to foundry floor.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, and I have a follow-up. Is your ability to ship revenue display if it being constrained by other display makers ability to capacity ramp? For example, we've heard some of application tools might not be able to ramp capacity as quickly as the market is demanding?
Robert Halliday: I've said right now, it's dependent on that.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific Crest. Your line is open.
Weston Twigg: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could help us understand the 3D NAND customers migrated from adding some Greenfield capacity this year to more planar NAND conversions. Can you give us an idea of what you're revenue opportunity is, maybe per 10,000 wafer starts of Greenfield 3D NAND versus planer conversion 3D NAND capacity?
Gary Dickerson: Sure, so this is confusing as hell and I am going to try make it half a confusing as hell. So, I am going to give you really simple numbers first. In 2012 total NAND spending was $4.2 billion. We think total NAND spending is just $9.2 billion. Applied Materials share that spending in 2012 was a little under 15%. Applied Materials share that spending over 20% this year. So our revenues are going to go from about $600 million a NAND to close to $2 billion for its share. So the market has more doubled but our revenues have more than tripled because our share is up 50%. Next observation, I will give you is if you compare Greenfield to Greenfield, I am happy to do that for you. A $100,000 wafer stock last planar Greenfield is $3.5 billion. A 3D Greenfield 48 per is $5 billion. But what you kind of have to model is what would they actually buying?  So in 2012 there was a mix of ads and converts right and so if you go look at the data, it's actually fair amount of adds oddly enough in 2012 but for us as a company we mostly were getting the shrink money. Mostly that money was more weighted on converts for Litho so do you go look at it and you go to a 50-50 model now roughly between converts from planar in 3D, our revenue opportunity for where we were in the three days is up more than 3x. And the simple math of what's going on was is 3x yields, it should be even more because the total spending is up. It will be more but there is unusually high spending on planar adds in 2012 so our revenue opportunity apples to apples was kind of over 3x. 
Weston Twigg: All right, I think I got all that. And the other piece of the question or the follow-up question is how much 3D-NAND capacity industry can realistically absorb each year. I would flooding the market with 3D NAND since you get more bits on a wafer. 
Robert Halliday: Well, what's going to happen is I believe and I think many people believe that is 3D NAND matures and becomes even more reliable and reduces its cost point particularly going to 48 an 64-layers, it's going to significantly expand its market so you kind of grow these drives. So right now we have, I think we had 1,394,000 wafers found in the world of man and through the end of last year 150,000 converted to about 375,000, I think the vast majority of it is converted over time because they are not going to be able to sell that 2D device very well and it's not going to be competitive.  One other thing I will add on 3D NAND overall, our position in 3D NAND is better than any other company. If you look at our strength in Etch the share gains will become evident this year very strong. We are number one in deposition. We have additional CMP staffs, Epi staffs. So again, if you look at our opportunity in 3D NAND. Really we are in a unique position so as those Greenfield factories ramp or the conversion happens. If you look at the spending profile, the spending profile is completely different than it was at 2D NAND. 
Gary Dickerson: Funny thing you wouldn't intuitively say is that in 2D our market share of conversions was less than our market share of adds. Because they are mostly litho tools. If you go to V-NAND our market share is high in adds but even higher in converts because they don't have to buy new [ph], okay. So they will convert model the total comes down but our share is pretty good actually.
Weston Twigg: All right, makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Jerome [ph] from BNP Paribas. Your line is open. 
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for taking my question. Could you just give us a little bit color on your…
Robert Halliday: Yes, we have a very strong momentum with ALD and we are pretty much on track with what we have previously communicated. Very strong position and leading logic and foundry customers. They are seeing device advantages as they are going to the most advanced technology nodes so we look at this as a very good opportunities. One of the areas that will fuel our share gains in 2016.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, great. Jerome, thanks for your question. We would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time today and thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials. 
Operator: This concludes this conference call. You may now disconnect.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike and good afternoon everyone. I'll start by commenting on Applied Materials' results and talk about our outlook and longer-term strategic goals. Then I'll share our views on the market and what this means for us in 2016. I'll conclude with my thoughts on each of our major businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our results and describe how we're optimizing the company's performance and delivering strong shareholder returns. In both semiconductor and display, we see dramatic technology changes taking place. When we look at the advances our customers are making, materials innovation is at the heart of these changes. I believe this creates great opportunities for us. We have the broadest and deepest talent and technology to enable the materials innovation, that will drive the semiconductor and display industries forward. Our strategy is to develop highly-differentiated materials engineering products and services that make major technology inflections possible. Our strategy is working and I'm pleased with our progress. We are turning the investments we've made in new products into profitable growth. When I look at our Q1 results and our outlook for 2016, there are four main drivers of our performance. First, our leadership businesses including Epi, PVD, Implant, CMP and RTP, have high market share and unique capabilities. I see these businesses delivering critical enabling technology that our customers need to drive significant innovations in transistor and interconnect for 10-nanometer devices. Second, our high-growth businesses, Etch and CVD, are winning substantial market share as the 3D NAND inflection and materials-enabled scaling accelerates. Third, we are delivering sustainable growth in service. 2015 was a record year for service revenue and in Q1 we booked our highest orders ever. And finally, we are growing beyond semiconductor, specifically in display. When I meet with leading display companies, it is clear that the industry is becoming highly dependent on materials innovation, especially as they introduce new technologies like OLED. This plays to our strengths and significantly expands our market. Now, let's turn to our market outlook. Like everyone, I'm mindful of the current global economic risks. Even in this environment, we believe 2016 wafer fab equipment spending levels will be similar to 2015. We are seeing industry investment focused on technology inflections, including 10-nanometer and 3D NAND, as well as increased spending in China. For our customers, the inflection-driven investments in foundry, logic and memory, are highly strategic. We have been witnessing a fierce battle for leadership in these new device technologies. When I talk to customers about their major competitive challenges, they talk about how critical it is to hit the right timing for major technology transitions. In foundry, we believe 2016 investment levels will be more or less the same as last year. We anticipate that the majority of spending will be for the 10-nanometer node, which will be heavily weighted towards the second half of the calendar year. In addition, we see a broadening of foundry spending and some shifts in customer mix, shifts that I believe are very favorable to us. In memory, we see NAND investment up about 25% year-on-year as more customers ramp 3D NAND technology. Our available market at a 3D NAND factory is up to three times greater compared to traditional planar technology. 2015 was a year of heavy DRAM investment, with the highest level of spending in five years. This year we expect DRAM investment to be down around 20% coming off this high. And in logic, we expect investment to be relatively flat year-on-year. Within the global environment, I look at China as a very significant opportunity. In China, we are seeing growth in revenue and orders, both from Chinese manufacturers as well as multinational customers who are expanding their footprints. I believe that Applied is very well positioned. We were the first company in our industry to establish a presence in China more than 30 years ago. Today, we have strong customer relationships and great talent to support the new projects that are ramping there. Now that I've given you this background on the market environment, I would like to talk about the progress and priorities for each of our major businesses. In semiconductor equipment, I'm pleased with our momentum. Technology changes are moving the market to our sweet spot in materials engineering. And this means that our served market is now 60% of total wafer fab equipment. We are investing more than ever in innovation and unique products to accelerate materials-enabled scaling for our customers. I like how our future pipeline is shaping up. And we have very strong pull for our latest technology. We are projecting that 40% of our 2016 revenue will come from products that we launched in the last three years. In 2015, we believe that we made solid share gains in wafer fab equipment, with almost all our major businesses growing or maintaining their market position. I expect that 2016 will be an even stronger year for us. In service, we aligned our strategy to enable customer success. We've done this by bringing together capabilities from across the company to deliver more value with our service products. The changes we've made to our strategy drove record performance in 2015, and we are now focusing on sustaining growth in this business. Because demand for service is seasonal in nature, we believe year-on-year comparisons are helpful. Our Q1 revenues are up 7% compared with the same period last year. I also look at service contracts as another leading indicator of our future growth. If we look back to 2012 and 2013, the net number of tools under contract was not growing. In 2015 we added around 1,250 tools under contract, and I expect us to continue this momentum. As I mentioned, in display, customers are also making strategic investments in new technology. We are seeing these investments accelerate, particularly for OLED displays. The display technology inflections significantly expand our available markets. For example, we project that our opportunity at an OLED factory is more than three times larger than at a traditional amorphous silicon LCD factory. We have great opportunities and momentum in display, and I'm excited about how we are positioned. Our display business has grown consistently for the past three years, and we expect to deliver additional growth in 2016 and beyond. To summarize, as I look ahead, I am confident about our future growth and performance. We are maintaining a positive outlook for Applied in 2016 because our customers are making strategic inflection-driven investments that play to our strengths. Our leadership businesses, where we have unique capabilities, are performing well as the market comes to the sweet spot of our technology. Our high-growth businesses, Etch and CVD, are making significant market share gains as the 3D NAND inflection accelerates. And we are delivering sustainable growth in service and display. Across the organization, we are focused on delivering enabling products and services and generating attractive returns for our shareholders. Now, let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our quarterly results, performance, and priorities. Bob?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Gary. Like Gary, I believe we're in a strong position to deliver profitable growth in 2016, as our customers invest in the technology roadmaps across semi and display. Based on the demand outlooks of our customers, I believe we'll make significant progress this year towards our 2018 financial model, and we will deliver very attractive cash returns to our shareholders. On the revenue line, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making in semiconductor systems market share. While we expect the WFE market to be about the same size this calendar year, we believe our share of WFE will be higher. We expect our SAM share of WFE to expand this year as well. In fact, we believe it will be up seven points compared to 2012. Our Global Services business is on track for a third consecutive year of growth, and we believe our display business will grow for a fourth consecutive year. I'm also encouraged by the progress our teams are making on our gross margin initiatives, and I am still confident that we'll make additional progress in our second half. On the operating expense line, we are tightly controlling our discretionary spending, holding OpEx relatively flat while strengthening R&D. We are making substantial R&D investments to deliver a strong pipeline of new products for emerging inflections. These products are already delivering revenue growth today. At the same time, we're reducing non-GAAP G&A to the lowest level in years. We've made further progress with our tax structure, and I believe we're on track to lower the rate once again this year. We continue to be aggressive with the buyback program. We've repurchased 112 million shares over the past three quarters, which is equal to 9% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the program. So while 2016 is shaping up to be a flattish year for WFE, we believe Applied will outperform our markets, making significant progress towards our financial 2018 model and deliver very attractive cash returns for our shareholders. Next, I'll make a few comments about the first quarter. When we delivered financial results that were slightly better than our expectations. Revenue of $2.3 billion declined 5% sequentially, and we slightly increased our non-GAAP gross margin to 42.4%. We held non-GAAP operating expenses within the range, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.26, slightly above the midpoint of the range. Turning to the balance sheet, we used $625 million to repurchase 35 million shares of our stock. We've completed 65% of the $3 billion authorization, and we'll continue to be opportunistic with the program. We also repaid $800 million in short-term debt and redeemed a $400 million bond scheduled to mature in June. Turning to the segments, Silicon Systems orders were 12% lower sequentially. Within the mix, only DRAM orders were higher. Our Silicon backlog remained healthy at $1.6 billion, and while revenue declined in Q1, we believe our demand will increase in Q2 and the second half. Our AGS orders reached $773 million and set another all-time quarterly record. AGS sequential revenue was slightly lower, consistent with seasonal patterns. Our display orders were down 6% sequentially, but remained up year-over-year. Our display revenue increased 12% sequentially. Bear in mind that display orders and revenue will continue to be lumpy. EES turned to modest profit even as revenue remained at low levels. Now, I'll provide our business outlook for Q2. We believe our overall net sales will be up by 5% to 10% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect Silicon Systems' net sales will be up by 11% to 17%; AGS net sales should be flat to up 5%. We expect our display net sales to be down by 20% to 30%, and EES net sales should be approximately $55 million. Our non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately flat, and we plan to hold non-GAAP operating expenses in a range of $565 million, plus or minus $10 million. We are forecasting a Q2 non-GAAP tax rate of 17%, and we believe non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.30 to $0.34. So in summary, we see 2016 as a year when a broad range of our customers invest in leading-edge technology across semi and display. Our investments have put us in a position to grow our served market, revenue, share and earnings. While we're mindful of the macroeconomic concerns, we believe 2016 will be a strong year for Applied Materials. Now, let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let's please begin.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question on the silicon side. So, given your outlook for you guys to outgrow WFE and where you are in terms of backlog and the orders in the quarter, the math seems to work that orders should be up at least 20%, 25% into the April quarter and then rising through the back-half of the year. Is that kind of the framework you're looking for? And I guess within that, how should we be thinking about mix between foundry, logic, memory through the year?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, C.J., I'll take a shot at that. We're not going to give specific orders guidance, but we have said, we do believe that the second half is stronger than the first half. We do believe that the first half is a little bit more weighted to NAND, whereas the second half is more weighted to stronger performance in foundry, logic and DRAM. So we do see a stronger second half. And incrementally, we see strong performance for Applied in the second half, because of our position on V-NAND throughout the year and also foundry and the 10-nanometer conversion. So we think the second half does feel more positive than the first half, and our position is pretty good in the second half.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Excellent. And I guess as follow-up, how should we think about the trajectory here off of a flat gross margin guide into the back-half of the year?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. We said on the last call that first half of fiscal 2016 would be flattish with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 when we did 42.2%. We did 42.4% in first quarter this year. We're guiding to about the same in Q2. So we're a little above what we thought we were a quarter ago and we still believe that the second half is up from the first half. We've said in the last call there to be a 200 basis point roughly increase from first half to second half. We think the full year is still positive as we've said. We think we exit the year. We think we're up in the second half. But given that we're a little ahead of plan in the first half, I don't know if there's a 200 basis point improvement from first half to second half.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Got you. Makes sense. Thanks so much.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.: Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on a solid quarter and a strong guide. I have two questions as well. The first one is regarding memory CapEx. Just given the recent pricing dynamics in memory, are you worried at all about DRAM and NAND CapEx in the back-half of the year? Or do you think the pending projects are strategic enough for your customers to spend according to plan?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, generally, we think that this year is sort of flattish with last year, when last year it was 31.5% to 32%. But the year is a good year for Applied Materials, because if you look at the spending this year, we kind of think foundry, logic are flattish, but the mix within foundry and logic spending in terms of what they're buying, I mean customer profile is very good for Applied. The second thing is within memory, DRAM is down about 20% and we think flash is up about 25%. And the predominant spending in flash is V-NAND. So that transition on V-NAND is particular good for Applied on three levels. One, the absolute level of greenfield spending for first and second generation V-NAND is higher than the absolute spending for planar NAND. The second thing is that the reuse – where they were doing a lot of reuse in the shrink on planar, is significantly less in first and second generation V-NAND, and particularly around tools that we sell. And thirdly, we're gaining on the transition. So I think that the mix within the year plays for Applied, and in terms of our concern, we think the 31.5% type number, maybe a little more on the year is a fair estimate, and we think we've taken the risk you've referenced into account.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.: Okay, helpful. Thank you. The second one is regarding your display business. I know, Gary and Bob, you've both touched on this, but can you maybe talk little bit about what you're seeing in terms of orders trends primarily in China today and how big the OLED opportunity could be for you guys in 2017 and beyond, I'm guessing primarily in Korea?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. The OLED is a great opportunity for Applied. We've talked about the increase in the total available markets there added CVD, PVD, thin film encapsulation steps. So if you do a comparison to amorphous silicon LCD, the total available market is up by about a factor of three for us. In display, we've talked about 2016, we're anticipating it being a fourth consecutive year of growth. And based on everything we're seeing, we're on track to either hit or exceed the 2018 model that we published for display previously. So display, we have tremendous momentum. And certainly OLED, especially in mobile, is a huge opportunity for us. The other thing I would say is that this is really a great proof of our ability to expand materials engineering into adjacent markets.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.: Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the lumpiness in some of the order patterns, particularly NAND, I mean for NAND to be as strong as you've talked about it. It seems like it's going to come back a lot in the second quarter, is that the right trajectory? And then longer-term, how long do you think this 3D investment sustains, and when do you think that that might peak?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. I'll take a shot at that. The – so if you look at it, the disconnect is, we think that NAND is stronger in the second half than the first half and we think there's an increase in traction around V-NAND – I'm sorry NAND is stronger in the first half than the second half. And you'd say, well, why did you have bigger DRAM orders and not NAND? We had already booked some. If you go look back to Q3, Q4, of 2015, we had very large bookings, and some of those were V-NAND bookings. Secondly, we see increasing traction. So if you see why we're beating in Q2, it's around two things in particular. It's around China and a wider proliferation of V-NAND. So we do see the momentum on V-NAND and we're pretty comfortable that it's going to happen.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then in terms of the length, the duration of this investment?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Oh, the duration.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Does it grow again you think in 2017? Do you have the visibility to say that?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So right now, there's about 1.4 million wafer starts in the world of NAND. Through the end of calendar 2015, 150,000 had been converted. We think cumulatively through the end of 2016 there's going be 350,000 to 400,000. So through the end of 2016, 400,000 of 1.4 million available have been converted. We think most of those get converted over time. This year, we think NAND spending is about $8.7 million. And we think it's sustained to pretty good levels over the next three years for this conversion. Does it stay that high? I'm not sure, but it's a pretty healthy number.
Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful, thank you very much.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Actually I had two. First, Bob, if I look at the service, orders have been pretty meaningfully above revenue for about a year now. And I thought that service usually had like a one-year contract. So I guess I would have thought that we would see some catch-up on revenue relative to bookings. So are these contracts now lengthening out beyond a year? Can you sort of bridge that gap for us? Thanks.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The service contracts are a good leading indicator of revenue and they are also a good leading indicator of sustainability of revenue, because you build in that relationship over time, and customers get greater value from us, frankly. And so, it's a win-win both ways. In terms of how you recognize it through the revenue plan, it is happening. A couple of things are happening though in the quarter. One, you did have the Chinese New Year and a little bit of slowdown started up earlier in Q1. So we book a lot of contracts typically in Q1, but the revenues – it's not a high revenue quarter, and fab utilization was okay in the quarter, so in terms of tactical sales of spares and services, not super high. And then 200-millimeter tools are in that number too, and those go up and down a little bit.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks, Bob. And, Gary, just a question for you on M&A. Can you just talk at a very, very high level about that? There's just not a lot of stuff in your current SAM that really can move the needle for you. So I guess the question is your willingness to think a bit outside the box and maybe expand your SAM into some new verticals. Thanks a lot.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks for the question. Regarding our current strategy, we like our current strategy. The outlook for 2016 we think is very strong. And beyond 2016, we also believe that there are great opportunities for growth. We have a strong position in transistor and interconnect as foundry and logic moves to the new technology node, very strong pull for Etch deposition tools also, especially in the memory space, but certainly in patterning and future technology nodes. We're growing service, growing the display business, and we believe that's sustainable growth in those markets. So overall, we're making tremendous progress towards the 2018 model, and we're optimistic about growth opportunities for Applied, especially when you look at what's driving this year and what's going to drive the future. You have 10-nanometer that is really based on materials – new materials, 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, new memory technologies, organic LED displays. All of those areas are enabled by materials innovation where Applied has clear leadership. And we think this is a -we're in the early innings of these changes and in driving materials-enabled scaling. So I am personally very optimistic about growth for Applied Materials. Relative to M&A, our strategy continues to be pretty much the same. We continue to look for good opportunities, but we're very selective in what we look at. There are three criteria: financial returns; strategic alignment, especially with our materials engineering technology; and does the company have an opportunity for leadership in whatever segments that they're in. So those are three things we look at. Certainly we keep looking for opportunities, but I am very confident about our growth opportunities, and we are definitely not needy relative to M&A.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot for that, Gary. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thank you. You talked about strength in China, and I'm seeing orders in this region up 20% sequentially and up over 50% year over year, and in terms of regions, your second-largest region for total orders. Can you guys talk a little bit about what's driving that strength and the sustainability of it?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I can start and then, Bob, if you want to add anything. So clearly there's a lot of activity in China. We see investments by both multinational companies and domestic companies. Applied has a very strong position in China. We were the first company to build capability there about 30 years ago; very strong team, very strong capability, very good relationships and positions with both the Chinese companies and the multinational companies that are moving to China. So we would look at this as certainly an incrementally very good opportunity in 2016. But my feeling is that this is certainly not just a 2016 story; that there's a great opportunity going forward, and for Applied we're very, very well positioned.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Thanks, Gary. And then I also had a question on OLED. So your display business is about $700 million to $800 million last year. Can you break down for us within that, how much is OLED revenue? And when do you think this business actually starts to move the needle for total revenues?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, we segment it in a couple of ways. One, we talk about historically between TVs and smaller screens, and the smaller screens historically have been split between OLED and non-OLED. Last year, mostly what we've sold was OLED. It was the encapsulation tools. Those were OLED-like. We talked about bookings last year of $150 million. Many people in the mainstream media speculate that there will be a more rapid transition, particularly in the small screens, to OLED. We are pretty well positioned for that. In terms of split of revenues, we said earlier in the year that our split of revenues that we were projecting for this year between small screens and larger screens, TVs and smaller screens, I think we were like 60% for the small mobile devices and about 40% for the others, mostly TVs. If anything, we think we're better positioned if there's an inflection that goes more strong in OLED. So over time we think there's probably more and more of that. Now put in perspective, we are much better positioned than we were several years ago there in terms of products and breadth of products. And there are about twice as many layers on OLED devices and LED screens. So I think we're very well positioned. The inflection seems to be happening, but we haven't talked specific numbers. And it won't hit our revenue line right away because these tools take about nine months to build.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question, I had two of them. First one, for Gary or Bob, looks like everyone is bullish on 3D NAND, which kind of makes sense given the technology transition going on. I'm curious. When you guys look at the risks to it, where do you think we could be wrong in terms of the 3D NAND growth? And along with that, have any of your customers actually looking at 2D NAND at like 12-nanometer or below, or do you think there's no more 2D NAND development being done? And then I had a follow-up.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think relative to 3D NAND, certainly when I'm spending time with customers, there's a tremendous competitive pressure to move to 3D NAND technology. So all the discussions – and I had met with many customers over the last few weeks, so all of the discussions were focused on that transition. Not everybody is in the same place relative to the maturity or the yield for that technology, but I certainly see that as an overwhelming focus for all of the memory companies.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Got it, and then a follow-up on the display side. It looks like when you compare to your semi business, your served available market on display is pretty low. I understand that you're riding the OLED wave. Is there any plan to actually make the display like a $2 billion revenue business by organically or inorganically developing products so that you can get a better percentage of the display CapEx?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We've got, as we've talked about, really good momentum in OLED with 3x larger TAM than we've had in the past. Bob talked about the number of steps increasing with CVD, PVD. We've entered thin film encapsulation also, so that gives us another growth driver. So we're very optimistic in terms of the growth opportunities in display. We are working on some other areas that would expand our TAM, but we're not ready to talk about those.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it, thank you.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Krish.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the solid results and guide. My first question is on 3D NAND. In your guidance of up 25%, can you tell us if you are including XPoint or any of the new memories in there? And secondly, if you could tell us what portion of the non-CapEx was 3D last year and how much of it is on 3D this year?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So I can take on the XPoint. XPoint still is really in the early phases. So really almost no CapEx for XPoint in our forecast. And what was the other question?
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): The other question was what portion of the CapEx within NAND is 3D in 2016 and what portion of it was 3D in 2015?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We think that in 2015, it was a little under 50% and we think in 2016 it's probably mid-80%s.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then one question on China. I wanted to just probe little bit more along China. There are two things we are seeing from China, one is, like, we have seen new fab announcements from new entrants. So I wanted to understand if you have seen any of the orders or any activity from new companies that are coming up in China like XMC or some of the other memory companies that have been announced? And secondly, there have also been some large equity investments in some of the tech companies in U.S. from Chinese private equity companies, and I wanted to hear if you have received any interest from any private equity firm in China?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So, the first question, have we seen memory orders from new Chinese manufacturers in China, Farhan?
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Memory or interest, like even activity, like, joint development projects or R&D lines or any sort of activity?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Let me try to answer and help. Most of the activity we're seeing tactically is from existing customers; existing customers in China already and existing customers outside of China who are increasing their footprint in China. We hear about people interested in technology and in acquisitions, but we're not really involved in that.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say we are engaged with some of these companies, but relative to business coming from those companies right now, it's very minimal. We are engaged with some companies that have future opportunities, but by far and away, the majority of the business today is from existing companies.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. That's all I have.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Farhan.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Nice job on the quarterly execution and the strong guide. On the foundry investment for this year, I think you guys were previously looking for a slight growth for foundry this year and now you're kind of guiding for flattish. I'm just kind of curious what's changed. Do you see a slower 10-nanometer conversion cycle? Or maybe slightly lower 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer capacity adds? Any color here would be appreciated.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I don't think we've changed much, frankly. I think we were flattish, slightly up last time. We're flattish now. I don't think there's been much change, frankly. I wouldn't read too much into it.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There has been some change in mix.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think mix has changed a little bit. In other words, we think some of our foundry customers are more committed to their spending, giving us orders. Some of the others seem to be hesitating. So we think the mix has changed a little bit from last quarter.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And those changes are also a positive for us in 2016.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it, okay. And then on DRAM, you expect it to be more second-half weighted. Are you starting to see the 1X nanometer DRAM conversion in your pipeline for the second half of this year? And is this part of what's driving the second half bias?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We see some of that happening this year, but we're not getting a lot of orders yet.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: But it is a big focus, there's no question. 1X is also another one of these competitive battlegrounds where there's a lot of focus.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thanks a lot.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hi, Gary and Bob, nice execution, just a follow-up question on China. So can you share your thoughts on the competitive landscape in semi-cap equipment from local Chinese semi-cap suppliers? I mean Applied has been there for many years. Do you see any meaningful local Chinese semi-cap competitors different from other regions in the world?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As you've said, we've been there for a long time. We have extremely strong relationships. I mean certainly you have some investment from multinationals moving to China. And the transitions that are happening there are areas where we have strong shares, strong momentum. And the domestic companies that are there, we also have a very strong share position. Historically, those positions have been some of the best that we have within the company and that really – we expect to continue that outlook in 2016.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, thanks, Gary. And then just a follow-up question for Bob on how to think about modeling gross margin in the second half of this year. It sounds like foundry customer mix, it's helping Applied's revenue in the second half of the year. But should we also think about that helping drive gross margin higher in the second half too, because of the favorable foundry customer mix? Thanks.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It should help some. If you go look at why it would be up from the first half through to second half, it would be because some of foundry mix – some cost reduction is helping us and some is maturing of new tools. The thing that helps us a little bit ahead of schedule in the first half is we had some pull-in a little bit of some of the foundry customers that we have. And this is some of the lagging node stuff as much as anything, where we have strong share and positions. So foundry does help us generally, because the mix of tools is more advantageous for us there.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, thanks, Bob.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much, and congrats on a nice year. Bob, first on the display side. Typically, it's always had little bit of a lower gross margins relative to your Silicon system. As this transition to OLED begins, is there any potential, I guess, margin improvement you see with the product portfolio and things that you have done on display side of things?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think display gross margins will improve over time. I think that in this year of early adoption of some of these new tools, I think they're okay. And then they get better through the end of the year into next year. The second thing that we talked about I think on the earlier calls is that the mix of tools we sell into small screens versus TVs. TVs is a sweet spot for us in terms of mix of tools and gross margins. It's a little bit different mix down at the smaller screen side with little lower gross margins. And as we mature our positions there, they should get pretty good. So by the time we're done, you'll see gross margins more attractive in display over the next year or two.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And Gary, maybe a question on a bigger picture related to EUV and potential capital intensity increases on future technology nodes on the logic end. Have you had any customer discussions that have highlighted, hey, EUV could be further delayed? What are you guys going to do to help us out? And maybe potentially, especially since your models are based on EUV getting the 7-nanometer logic node, maybe just on a big picture basis, what are some of the, I guess, additional incremental opportunities for Applied if EUV misses this next node?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks for the question, Patrick. We have a number of very deep engagements with customers in patterning. Certainly patterning cost is one area that's a big focus, but also from a yield standpoint, edge placement errors are another area that is a big focus for our customers. And this is another area where, again, materials innovation, materials engineering, there are some really great opportunities for us. So as we continue to drive new capabilities with the new products that we've introduced over the last three years, the combinations of those products we also see tremendous opportunity. So the engagements that we have with customers I would say are further out, broader, deeper than we've ever had. And this particular area is one that is a huge focus for all of our customers.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter end guide. My question is on the foundry side. With improved visibility of your 10-nanometer orders, do you think 10-nanometer will be a smaller node similar to 20-nanometer, or is it closer to through node? And related to that, how much of 10-nanometer capacity do you expect by the end of this calendar year? And lastly on this topic, what's the incremental equipment for 2016, 14-nanometer versus 10-nanometer and maybe between 10-nanometer versus 7-nanometer? If you can give some color, it would be great.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, let me see if I can do this efficiently. Our customers tend to think of these as sister nodes now, 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, and then 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer. They do the interconnect stuff more on the first leg and they do the transistor stuff more on the second leg. So they tend to ramp quickly through the first leg, whether it be 20-nanometer or 10-nanometer, to get to 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, or 7-nanometer. And so my guess, 10-nanometer won't be a long node. They're already going to start doing parallel work on the 7-nanometer, and so it won't be a long node. The total node of 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, the sister might be an attractive node, but they've got to get to 7-nanometer. Okay, that's one and two. In terms of comparing 20-nanometer/16-nanometer/14-nanometer to 10-nanometer/7-nanometer, there are differences. You have to look at what the backfill is from the previous node on a lot of this stuff. So if you look at 20-nanometer, they change the interconnect, but it was the last planar transistor, it wasn't a FinFET. So the attractiveness in terms of processing power and battery, processing speed and battery is a lot better on a FinFET. So that you didn't have a lot of people pull to go to 20-nanometer, they waited for 16-nanometer. You don't have that disadvantage when you're going from 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer. So there will be a lot of tapeouts still coming at 16-nanometer from people who went from 28-nanometer and so forth. So you're not going have back this back-filled gap you had at 20-nanometer. So point number one, 10-nanometer/7-nanometer are probably attractive. They get through 10-nanometer pretty aggressively. You won't have as big a gap as you've had at 20-nanometer because 16-nanometer will backfill and tapeouts will increase.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Switching to a different subject, how should we think about your buybacks in your April quarter now that your thinking is down to roughly $1 billion remaining authorization? And are you restricted somehow by domestic cash balance to do more buybacks beyond the existing program?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, the total authorized buyback was $3 billion. Through the end of fiscal Q1, we've done $1.950 billion, so we have $1.050 billion left under the existing authorization. The way we execute the authorization is we look at multiple valuation metrics of the company and we set up a table, such that if the stock price is attractive based on, frankly, longer-term metrics, then we will buy stock. So we pretty aggressively bought stock the last three quarters. We started to get a little bit tight on U.S.-sourced cash in September. So what we did was we were able to trigger home some $800 million of cash as a repatriation of capital without paying tax. And secondly, we raised some money through debt. So right now, about 50% of our cash is onshore at the end of the fiscal quarter. So we think we have enough cash to execute the buyback. And then if we want to continue – we are committed to long-term cash returns to shareholders through dividends and buyback. If we want to continue to buy back after discussion with the board, we believe we can find other sources of cash.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific Crest. Your line is open.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Hi, thanks. I just have a couple of questions. First, operating expenses, they look like they're creeping up a little based on the guidance. I'm just wondering if you think that flattens out moving forward or if that grows a bit more in the second half.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We said we're about $5 million over in Q1, about $5 million over the midpoint in Q2. So I think we're a $5 million over model for a quarter or two. But I think we're pretty much holding the line.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Did you say $5.55 million or $5.65 million for Q2?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We're flat from Q2 forward.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. The other question is just related to the Inspection segment. You have the new E-Beam tool, a new optical tool. KLA had a pretty good quarter and outlook. They had orders up 26% last quarter and they have a new inspection platform launching this year. You said you'll get more aggressive in that segment. So I'm just wondering if you can walk us through what you think happens in the Inspection segment. Do you think you can gain some share or grow your SAM this year, or is it more of a 2017 event?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're pretty optimistic on wafer inspection and review for 2016. Our UVision brightfield tool has a good position in foundry and logic. Last quarter we talked about receiving our first revenue for our new E-Beam inspection platform in both memory and foundry. E-Beam technology is the largest part of PDC revenue, our PDC division. We're number one in E-Beam review, and now taking that technology into Inspection, where we have significant pull from customers. So overall in 2016, we're pretty optimistic about that business.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, good. Thank you.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Wes. And, operator, I think we have time for two more questions, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Yes. Good afternoon. So a quick question on the mature side of the business. What is your view right now for 200-millimeter business this year? And what impact does that have on margins in general?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: 200-millimeter business ticked up last year. 200-millimeter business is driven mostly for things like sensors, CIS devices. There's a growing content of those in your mobile devices and also in things like automobiles. Last year it spiked up as they added capacity. We think sales of 200-millimeter tools this year might be down a little bit, but healthy.
Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And then over the next two years, do you think that's still an IoT growth market for you?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Generally speaking, we're positive on IoT growth in sensors and things like that. How it translates into used 200-millimeter tools sales, we're not sure past this year.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that those – the other wafer processing CIS, CMOS image sensors, power devices, RF sensors, all of those areas are definitely areas of growth. And some we're seeing in China with some of the business incrementally in 2016, but definitely that will continue to grow. Whether it's 200-millimeter or 300-millimeter, I think that it may not be 200-millimeter far into the future, but certainly that is definitely an area of growth and opportunity for Applied.
Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Mark Heller from CLSA. Your line is open.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks for squeezing me in. Two questions on OLED. I guess first, along with the display business you're guiding down I think 20% to 30% on revenues for the April quarter. I was wondering if you could give any color on the expectations for display orders in the April quarter.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Again, these tools take nine months to build, Mark. So I wouldn't read too much into the Q2. I think that the general direction is positive and our position is positive on display. So I think I wouldn't read too much into Q2, that's more of a result of what we booked six months to nine months ago.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. But any color on direction of orders for the April quarter for display?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We don't usually guide explicit orders, but we're directionally positive.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay. And then it sounds like most of the interest or activity is on small-screen displays. But I was wondering if you have any thoughts on OLED TV pickup and investment there?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Certainly the big inflection right now is in mobile, and we see tremendous opportunity there. TVs is really a longer-term opportunity.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Mark, for your question. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. As this is our fiscal year end call, I'd like to start by outlining the progress we are making towards our longer-term strategic and performance goals. I will then provide our market outlook and describe how this translates to opportunities and priorities for our business groups. Later in the call, Bob will give you additional color on our financial results and talk about how we are optimizing the company's performance and shareholder returns. Applied Materials' strategy is built upon our leadership in materials engineering. Our foundational capabilities are the broadest and deepest in the industry. We have more tools in our toolbox to help our customers address their most critical technical challenges. Across the company, we are driving profitable growth by targeting major technology inflections and introducing new, differentiated, enabling products and services, for our customers. As a result, we are winning market share, growing our service business and expanding our available opportunities. In fiscal 2015, we grew revenues 6% year-on-year and delivered our highest operating profits in four years. And while it's too early to talk about specifics for the calendar year, we are confident that we have made sustainable share gains in both wafer fab equipment and display. Investments we have been making in R&D and field technical capabilities are yielding results. This year, we released breakthrough new product platforms to address rapidly growing opportunities in Etch, atomic layer deposition, and selective materials removal. At the same time, we have made the company more agile and efficient by optimizing the organization, business processes and product portfolios. These changes allow us to fuel our growth programs while maintaining our operating expenses at approximately the same run rate we had in 2012. At the start of the year, industry forecasts expected 2015 wafer fab equipment to be up 5% to 10% year-on-year. Our latest estimate is that wafer fab equipment spending will be more or less flat relative to 2014. As the year progressed, the biggest change was foundry spending. We anticipate that calendar 2015 will represent the lowest spending levels by these customers in the past four years. While Applied has our most favorable share positions at the foundries, we have introduced new products to strengthen our position in memory and continue to get stronger in this market. In the past two years, we've increased our share of total DRAM wafer fab equipment spending by about 5 points. We also expect to increase our share of total NAND spending by approximately 5 points in the transition from planar to second generation 3D NAND. Overall, 2015 is a year of very strong memory investments with the highest level of spending by these customers in in seven years. As we look ahead, we expect DRAM bit demand to be in the 25% to 30% range, and investment levels in 2016 to be down significantly. In NAND, we believe next year's demand bit growth will be around 35% to 40%, and 2016 investments will be up year-on-year. We expect around 80% of spending to be focused on 3D NAND, as all the major memory customers ramp this technology into volume production. In foundry, we anticipate investment levels will be slightly higher in 2016 with the bulk of spending in the second half of the year. We believe more than 50% of this spending will be focused on ramping 10-nanometer technology. In logic, we expect investment levels to be reasonably stable year-on-year. Overall, we currently see 2016 wafer fab equipment spending being approximately flat with some potential upside. Having provided this backdrop, I will now outline the progress and priorities for each of our major businesses. In semiconductor equipment, we delivered our highest annual revenue in eight years, as major changes in device technology continue to expand our opportunities and provide a catalyst for market share gains. We have very strong momentum in our largest growth businesses, Etch and CVD, and still have significant room to grow. In fiscal 2015, our Etch revenues exceeded $1.1 billion, an eight-year record, and we generated our highest CVD revenues in four years. Combined, our Etch and CVD revenues are up significantly year-on-year, and we continue to see very strong customer pull for our new products. At the start of 2015, we targeted 25 new applications as part of our growth plan. By the end of our fourth quarter, we have won 49 new applications. In our transistor and interconnect businesses, where we maintain strong leadership positions, we secured new applications wins at 10-nanometer that will enable us to increase our share of the available market as customers build out this node. At 10-nanometer, customers are making significant changes to interconnect technology to improve device performance and power consumption. We will be officially releasing new products to address advanced interconnect applications early in the New Year. In addition, we are benefiting from new epi, thermal and implant steps and memory that expand our market. We also have a significant opportunity to grow in CMP, as the number of CMP steps doubles in the planar to 3D NAND inflection. This quarter we shipped the one hundredth unit of our latest generation CMP tool, the LK Prime. The success of this product helped our CMP group post its highest annual revenues since 2011. In Process, Diagnostics, and Control, we recently released UVision 7, a new version of our brightfield inspection tool. This is another area where we see strong pull from customers and believe we're on track for share gains in brightfield this year. We have also been investing in a new E-Beam inspection platform, and this quarter, we posted our first revenue from both foundry and memory customers. In service, 2015 revenues represent an all-time record for the company. Our team and AGS has done a remarkable job to place this business on a trajectory of profitable growth. Over the past two years, we have aligned our service strategy to enable our customer's success, while making significant enhancements to the organization, processes and operations that together, are enabling us to deliver and capture more value with our service products. We believe that our growth momentum in service is sustainable, and our fourth quarter orders represented another all-time record. In display, 2015 was a third consecutive year of growth. As the display industry introduces new technologies for both TV and mobile applications, customers' manufacturing processes are becoming more complex and our market opportunity is expanding. As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, one of the key battlegrounds will be for OLED leadership. As this inflection plays out, Applied is in a great position to benefit with new, enabling products, including our thin-film encapsulation system. To summarize, in fiscal 2015, Applied Materials delivered solid growth and moved the ball forward towards our long-term strategic and financial goals. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees around the world for their tremendous contributions over the past 12 months. As we look ahead, we feel very good about our strategy, our customer positions, and our product pipeline. Across the company, we remain laser focused on delivering, delivering the enabling products our customers need to be successful, and delivering attractive returns for our shareholders. To achieve our goals, we are aggressively driving our growth programs, making the company more efficient and effective and carefully managing expenses. Now, let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide more details about our results, performance and priorities. Bob?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Gary. And thank you all for joining us today. I will start by outlining the progress we made in 2015. We remain focused on investing in growth opportunities, increasing profitability, and delivering attractive cash returns to shareholders. First, growth: For the year, our total orders grew by 5% to the highest level in 15 years when excluding solar. We grew our revenues by 6%. As compared to 2013, our revenues were up 29%. Our silicon systems orders and revenues were the highest since 2007. Revenues grew by 3% in 2015, building on a 25% gain in 2014. 2015 has been a very strong year for memory spending, and Applied made significant progress. Our strong position in 3D NAND gave us further growth in Etch and CVD. Combined, these businesses were up 23% for the year and have doubled since 2013. Gary mentioned that our Etch revenues exceeded $1.1 billion for the year, and they were up 140% versus 2013. Our transistor and interconnect product lines maintained their leadership positions in 2015, and we expect the strength of these businesses to become more evident when foundry spending resumes later in our fiscal year. Applied Global Services revenues grew 15% in the year, with continued momentum in comprehensive service contracts as well as 200 millimeter equipment demand. And display revenues grew 27%, reflecting the success of new products such as thin-film encapsulation and PVD for mobile displays that are expanding our addressable market. Next, profitability: On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin declined 1.2 points in 2015, or about 0.7 points when, excluding the non-run rate items that we reported in 2014. Operating margin remained at 19.6% for the year, as revenue growth and spending discipline offset the gross margin decline. We made further progress in our tax structure and achieved a full year tax rate of 19.3%, which was down by 13 points over the last five years. Earnings per share of $1.19 were our highest in four years, and the highest in eight years, when excluding solar. Now cash returns: Total shareholder returns from buybacks and dividends for the year grew to $1.8 billion, which was nearly 200% of free cash flow. In Q3 and Q4, we deployed 44% of our three-year, $3 billion buyback authorization. We used $1.3 billion to repurchase 76 million shares, reducing our ending share count by 6% during the period. We also completed a $1.8 billion debt offering in September in an attractive interest rate environment. The offering was very well received and provides low cost capital to support increased financial flexibility for investments and capital returns. We also added $800 million of short-term debt to facilitate the efficient return of capital from one of our offshore entities. This debt is expected to be repaid within the current quarter. Next, I'll make a few comments about the fourth quarter. Our overall results were at the midpoint of guidance. Revenues declined 5% sequentially, but grew 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 42.2% was modestly above our expectations, and operating expenses were $11 million below the midpoint of guidance. We used $700 million to repurchase 44 million shares of our stock at an average price of $15.78. Turning to the segments; silicon systems orders were up 8% over year. Orders declined sequentially, following an all-time group record in Q3, and backlog remains strong at $1.7 billion. AGS orders of $761 million were up 2% year-over-year, and set another all-time quarterly record. Revenues were below the midpoint of our expectation, as 200 millimeter equipment sales were slightly lower than expected. Display orders were up 50% year-over-year, as expected. Display operating margins declined to 10%, reflecting a high mix of mobile products along with investments in new products that should significantly increase our addressable market and revenues. EES orders and revenues remained weak, and we continue to reduce our exposure to solar. Now, let me talk about our priorities for the year ahead. As Gary discussed, we expect 2016 to be another year of healthy demand across silicon systems, services and display. In silicon systems, our early expectations are that demand should be higher in the second half of our fiscal year, particularly within foundry. Throughout the company, we are focused on making further progress toward our longer-term financial model. On the revenue line, our outlook for overall demand, market share and served market expansion is positive. Gross margin improvement is a top priority for the company. We expect improvements in our second half, driven by three factors. First, we expect a more favorable mix, including higher foundry demand in silicon systems, and stronger TV demand in display. Second, we have line of sight to cost reductions for fast ramping new products. Third, we are making progress on our materials cost reduction. For our operating expenses, we are performing better than our model. Our focus is to maintain spending discipline and to fund growth initiatives using identified savings and portfolio rationalization. For the tax rate, we expect to make incremental progress towards the model. And we will continue to be opportunistic with the stock buyback program to reduce the share count. Now, I will provide the business outlook for our first quarter, which includes 14 weeks of operations. As compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect our overall sales to be down 2% to 9% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect silicon systems sales to be down 7% to 13%. AGS sales should be roughly flat. We expect display sales to be up 5% to 15% and EES sales should be approximately $50 million. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately flat. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million plus or minus $10 million. This includes two weeks of scheduled holiday shutdown, partially offset by the extra week in the quarter. Given we recently raised debt, we expect our quarterly interest expense to increase to approximately $38 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.27. In summary, Applied delivered another year of growth in orders, revenues and profitability. The investments we've made are resulting in share gains and a strong pipeline of new products aimed at key market inflections with strong customer pull. We are increasing our profitability and providing attractive cash returns to our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Kyle, let's please begin.
Operator:  Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess, first question on the gross margin, it came in a little better I think, and guided flattish. Would love to hear your thoughts on what the magnitude would look, like in terms of the uplift as we head into more favorable mix, et cetera, in the back half of fiscal and calendar of 2016.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, I'd be happy to do it. Let me give you a little more color on the mix issue because we've talked about a lot. If you go look at the WFE mix for the last several years, for the three-year average from 2012 to 2014, foundry spending was about – almost 44% of the WFE mix. If you go look at DRAM, it was about 14.5% and NAND was about 17.7%. If you go look at this year, foundry was about 34.5%, DRAM was up to 25.1% and NAND was about 23.5%. We think foundry goes up as a percentage of the mix next year and NAND goes up. Now, foundry is our highest percentage of WFE and NAND, which used to trail is approaching at the 3D inflection our share for foundry. So there's two stronger relative spending areas we see next year are foundry and especially NAND around V-NAND, where we say it's over 80% of the NAND spending next year. So if you trail it down, we see gross margin and revenue opportunities for us, share opportunities and gross margin improvement opportunities. Now, we see those more in the second half because we think foundry is heavier in the second half, particularly around the 10-nanometer inflection. We think NAND is strong, but a little stronger in the second half. DRAM could go 50-50 split and logic could be pretty even. So if you look at the quarters in here, and I'm going to get to your specific question, C.J., but to give you context, I thought this would be helpful. We're assuming that our Q2 revenues and gross margins will be similar to Q1 with pickup in the second half. And in the second half, we see a booster for our revenues and our gross margins. And the gross margins, the opportunity for the company to improve are – we could go up quarter-on-quarter, half-on-half, we could go up – there's a lot of mix issues there, but the opportunity is a couple of points, half-on-half.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Very helpful. And I guess as a quick follow-up, you talked about NAND spending being up, led 80% by 3D, could you walk through what your expectations are for Greenfield versus upgrades in calendar 2016? Thank you.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. So we see total V-NAND this year to be 150 ending this year. We see total ending next year to be about 350 to 400. That's a combination of adds and converts. Over 80% of the spend is on NAND. And then in terms total brand new adds, it depends on the customer converts. The total is going to get to 350, 400, we think, by the end of the year.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Okay. Thank you.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess first question is really a longer-term question about China as a new entrant into the memory industry. I mean, it's something we've seen over the years be so important to the semicap industry, whether it was Japan, Inc., or Korea, Inc., or Taiwan, Inc., and now it seems like China, Inc., is determined to become a player in the memory industry, in particular the DRAM industry, I guess, to start. So I guess, how big of an opportunity do you think it could be, how soon do you think it could impact your P&L? Obviously, I would think that the commentary you made about 2016 would include any early opportunities you see from China, but more really over the next couple of years.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thanks for the question. Clearly, a lot of activity in China, as you've said, we have a very strong position in China. Applied just celebrated 30 years in China. We've got a great team and great capability there, very strong customer relationships and very strong share positions with Chinese companies and the multinational companies that are in China. There are a number of projects that people are talking about. There's certainly going to be some incremental wafer fab equipment spending in 2016. I don't know that we want to give a specific number right now. But I would say there are a lot of projects that are in the pipeline. And that could be from a strategic investment standpoint additive for wafer fab equipment. And our share there, Bob talked about our share in foundry. Our share in China is very, very, very strong. And again, 30 years we've built a very strong team there.
James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's very helpful. Thanks. And I guess as a quick follow-up, if I could just ask, obviously there's some consolidation that's been announced in the industry. Would love your quick thoughts on whatever opportunities or threats you perceive as it relates to that consolidation. Thank you.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Again, thanks for the question. We like our strategy. As I've talked about on the call and also Bob's talked about, we have a very strong position in transistor and interconnect when foundry ramps, and Bob talked about that being in the second half of calendar 2016. We have strong customer pull for Etch, deposition and inspection. Very, very strong customer pull. We're growing the service business, significant opportunity to grow our display CAM, two, three X above where we're at right now, great alignment and pull from customers for our R&D pipeline. So, we're very focused on our opportunities. Bottom line, we're winning on selections, we have a good position to grow as our customers move to next generation technologies in semi and display. Regarding Applied M&A, really nothing has changed relative to our strategy. We're very selective in the opportunities that we look for. There are really three criteria that are the same that we talked about before: financial return, strategic alignment, leadership in whatever segments the company is participating in. So those are the things that we look for. The hurdle for us is very high. Obviously we can't talk about anything that we're specifically looking at from an M&A standpoint. But, again, bottom line, we're winning in selection and our strategy is positioning us really well to create value for customers and grow the business.
James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Good luck.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Intel has publicly said that this year's CapEx is an anomaly and that they'll spend more next year. So I'm just trying to reconcile that with your outlook for logic being flat in 2016.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, we think, overall, Logic is up somewhat. It's on the up, a little bit up, frankly. And that we don't have classified in Logic Intel's initiative in memory, right? So, that's in their memory bucket. And then the third issue is there's some other cats and dogs or smaller opportunities down below the Intel level, so it's not all Intel. So some of those aren't growing as much as Intel.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Then another clarification I had, Bob, was just on the 14-week quarter, just so we can model April properly, is there much of an impact to revenues in either January or what you would perceive in the April period?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, it's really more of an OpEx management issue and we're kind of mitigating that with two weeks of shutdown to offset the full extra week of OpEx expense.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, and if I could just one for Gary. Gary, as you mentioned, fiscal 2015 was a good year. You grew your revenues. You had record profits and you guys made a lot of progress lowering the share count, OpEx, and the tax rate. The share price, though, is down about 30% over the last 12 months. And I realize that the merger accounts for a lot of the weakness. But just wondering from this standpoint, what the management thinks they can do to improve shareholder value from here.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, as I said before, if you look at our business, break it down into different pieces, foundry is down a significant amount relative to the mix, and if you look at our position in transistor and interconnect when foundry ramps, that is a real strength and really a unique strength for Applied Materials, epi, PVD, implant, CMP, RTP, all of those areas are very strong leadership positions for Applied. The incremental profitability, as that CapEx increases, there's a lot of drop-through to the bottom line. So the mix this year of memory versus foundry, is different than what we've seen over the last few years. So when foundry comes back, we're in a better position than any company, really, relative to the incremental profitability. The other thing on the foundry is that, at 10-nanometer different than 16-nanometer, there are big changes in terms of the device architecture. Interconnect is growing a significant amount, and our share and number of steps will grow as those devices ramp. So that's one that's a big driver for us when the mix comes back. We've talked about the products that we've introduced, the really tremendous momentum we have in Etch, the CVD, ALD, these areas that are growing for us at a very high rate. And I still think we're in the early innings relative to the pull that we have from customers. You're going to continue to see growth in those areas as we go forward. And as Bob talked about, our memory position has increased significantly. So as the customers are ramping those 3D NAND technologies, that puts us in a good position. We're growing the service business and we believe it's sustainable growth in service. And as our customers move to new technologies and displays, that's another area where they're adding steps, depositions, materials engineering steps that give us a great opportunity. So you put all those things together, again we're winning in inflection and we really have a great opportunity to grow in all of our different business segments as customers transition to these new technologies.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. I guess first question really is for Gary. So Gary, given the merger that we saw announced, there was a lot of bold moves to sort of shake things up in the industry, I guess, most of what you've done so far is to consolidate markets that you're already in. But if you look sort of to those markets, there's not a whole lot you can do that would really move the needle. So I guess I wanted to ask you about your willingness to sort of look outside of your traditional front end wafer fab equipment markets, maybe into the back end, maybe into some non-semi stuff. Sort of how do you think about the strategic way where you can grow the earnings to $2 or more? It seems like you might have to look outside of your traditional front end WFE markets. Thanks.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Tim, many thanks for the questions. So, again, if you look at our businesses, if you get to a mix of foundry and memory that's more similar to what we've seen in the past. As I said before, our transistor and interconnect business is very, very, very strong. And we see growth in terms of the number of steps, as our customers are transitioning to these next-generation devices. If you look at Etch and deposition, we've grown maybe $1 billion over the last two years or three years. We still think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to grow there going forward. A significant opportunity. One of the things I talked about this last year is that we had a goal of 25 applications wins. We actually won 49 new applications. And that gives us a great tailwind going forward in terms of those areas. So that's $10 billion market opportunity where our share momentum is strong, we have great products, we're winning applications, critical applications with customers in those areas. So big opportunity for us to grow. Service has grown about $500 million over the last two years. And in display, what we've talked about is the opportunity to triple our TAM. And we could be somewhere around $1 billion in display this year. And there are changes in technology that will happen in display that are also great opportunities for us. So you put all those things together and you have a more normalized mix in terms of memory foundry, mobile, TV, and you have a market around 33.5 billion in wafer fab equipment. We have a lot of momentum to hit the model that we had talked about before. Now, relative to the areas that you talked about, Tim, all I can say here is that we have the same criteria that we had before, the financial returns, strategic alignment, leadership in whatever businesses that we're looking at, but we really can't comment in a public forum like this on anything that we're looking at. The other thing I would say, though, is we have a very high bar for M&A, but I also believe you miss the 100% of the shots you don't take. We have a great team at Applied Materials, and I think if we find the right opportunity, I have tremendous confidence that we can execute on that opportunity. Bob, I don't know if you want to add anything.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, see if I can be responsive to your question, Tim, and the investors. There's kind of three ways we move the needle here, there's inorganic stuff, there's organic stuff, and then there's capital returns to investors and how we do that. So if you look at the inorganic stuff, Gary's right, we look at everything, and we're aggressively looking at everything and we're very open-minded to it, so we've closed no doors. On the organic stuff, I frankly think the results are even better than they even appear. If you look in display and AGS, we're growing them more rapidly than they had in years. If you look at the semi business, if you look by vertical, our highest share is foundry where we've maintained that, we've gained five points of share in the last couple of years in DRAM, five points of share in the transition from 2D NAND to 3D NAND, and we gained three to five points we think in Logic. Okay? So in all the verticals, we're doing well. You say, "well, I don't see it enough in the P&L." Well, foundry's down nine points this year and DRAM's up nine points. I don't think anyone projects that's going to be a sustainable future. So as we gain share in virtually every vertical, and the mix normalizes, that revenue growth opportunity looks pretty good in the semi business. And in the Etch business, where we're gained, up over $1.1 billion, we start to, in later years, get a lot more service business out of that too because that's a very attractive business. So within in the organic markets, when you look at performance within vertical, performance by product, performance in terms of revenue growth and also in AGS and display, pretty darn good. No one predicted nine months ago, a year ago, that foundry was going to be down this year and be nine points down as a percentage of CapEx. And nobody predicts it's going to stay that way. We managed to grow revenues, orders, and profit in that environment. And I don't think you go to a cocktail party, anybody says historically Applied is a DRAM company versus a foundry company. But we're growing our DRAM share five points, okay?
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it, Bob. Thank you for that. I guess it was a quick follow-up. Gary, you just talked about $1 billion in revenue. Do you mean you could do $1 billion in display revenue next fiscal year, for fiscal 2016, is that what you mean?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If you were consolidating in display, the display upgrades, it's been in the service business, so that had been segmented out of display, and we're going to consolidate also the web business into display. So you put all those things together, and you get closer to $1 billion. Again, we had segmented out the upgrade business there, which is different than what we've done with some of our other segments. So put all those things together and that's how you get closer to the $1 billion. And what I would say, if you look at – we can't talk about specifically what customers are doing, but there's some big changes in the display market that could be really great opportunities for us over the next two years to three years to grow that business even further.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, if you look at the revenue growth in display, it's pretty impressive. You know, they were 473 in 2012, 538, 615, 739, 780 and we think next year is a strong year also. And then also we bundled the display upgrades into AGS. So when you gross up the display business, it is probably next year pretty close to $1 billion, all in, including some services, too, I guess. So it's growing pretty well.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. One is for Gary or Bob. You guys highlighted how the last four years was great for foundry spending and now it's moderated this year. If you look at the last four years, it's like smartphone growth is very strong. I'm just kind of curious what makes you think that this year is not the new norm for foundry spending? And along the path, do you think there's going to be any reuse for 10-nanometer foundries? And then I have a follow-up.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll start, you can finish? So if you go look at 2015 a couple of things happened. The biggest thing was if you go look at this, you got to look at the node and the previous node and the next node when you consider spending and reuse. So if you go look, I don't think anyone thought that 20-nanometer was a super device. A lot of customers, and you guys know this, looked forward to the introduction of FinFETs and the FinFET device at 16-nanometer/14-nanometer was a more powerful device for them in terms of processor and power. Right? So not too many customers did 20-nanometer tape-outs. You know that, right? What we're seeing is that 16-nanometer/14-nanometer, by the time they're done, is going to be a big node for tape-outs. So what you had is a fair amount of the equipment at 20-nanometer can move to 16-nanometer/14-nanometer. So it is the height of the opportunity for reuse because there weren't a lot of tape-outs at 20-nanometer. Now, when you go to 10-nanometer – now, the one thing that helped you at 20-nanometer for the one particular customer that went big with 20-nanometer. They buy a fair amount of equipment at the first part of this two node buyout, 20-nanometer/16-nanometer, so the 10-7, because a lot of the equipment is necessary for interconnect and they buy at the front end, it was two node buying pattern. Now that's very good for Applied, frankly. So as you look at the transition from 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer versus 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer, the plus, you kind of had them both, is the big spend on interconnect and a little bit of the front end. We benefit from that. What you had as a minus, two minuses kind of at the 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer node, a lot of people moved their demand from 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer and there wasn't a lot of backfill. So 16-nanometer projects to be a big long node, so a lot of that capacity is going to stay there and not move to 10-nanometer. So you're going to get a fair amount of buying at the 10-nanometer node. So we think 10-nanometer is a pretty big spending node for us and I think the customers say that too.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And many new steps, also.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And many new steps. If you look at the interconnect stuff, it's up high percentage and that's a very good sweet spot for us. 10-nanometer will be big because you've got a node before you at 16-nanometer/14-nanometer, that's a powerful node, so not going to going move everything to 10-nanometer, they're going to keep a lot at 16-nanometer/14-nanometer. They're still growing. And then 10-nanometer will be good because you've got the FinFET and you've got the new interconnect. You didn't have the new FinFET at 20-nanometer.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I'm kind of curious, and I understand the thought process on the M&A side, I'm just curious more on the organic development side. If I look at your some of the products there that investing or trying to gain traction, for example, offset a dielectric Etch there, there's not been a whole lot of traction. And also the E-Beam products where it looks like Hermes has already won that battle and it might be a niche market. I'm kind of curious, what are the thought process in the organic product developments? Are you guys looking to hit singles from this or do you expect this to be a big home run, driving like $500 million or $1 billion revenue stream?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I would say in Etch with Sym3, we went from something like 10 chambers to close to 500 chambers, 450 chambers in five quarters. We've never seen a ramp like that at Applied Materials and you very rarely see that kind of adoption anywhere in the industry. And I was traveling actually most of the last six weeks with pretty much all of our major customers. The pull is really phenomenal. I talked about the 49 application wins in Etch and CVD. We have tremendous, tremendous pull from customers and we're winning critical applications also. This is not just non-critical applications. Some of the most critical applications, the design of our technology is outperforming the competition. So we look at that – the Etch business, $6 billion market, it's a great opportunity for us. Relative to your question on dielectric Etch, again, you have a $6 billion market, we certainly have gained share, but our position going forward on new applications is also very, very strong. And the pull from customers is tremendous. So our focus has been really on conductor Etch. We wanted to go where we had the best opportunities, where we could create the most value for the customers. We continue to focus on areas that are the best fit for our differentiated technology and customer high value problems. And I can tell you, there's still a lot of room there for us to grow in the Etch business. So tremendous growth over the last few years, but still phenomenal pull and momentum and opportunity for us going forward. In E-Beam inspection, I wouldn't say the game is anywhere close to over. Our PDC business, the majority of our revenue in PDC comes from E-Beam products. We have very strong position in E Beam review. We've gained some share in CD SEM, CD metrology also. And really the focus there is around the most critical imaging applications. We have world class electron optics, and the team is bringing that technology leadership now into E-Beam inspection and we have a great opportunity going forward. So I wouldn't say – again, I've been in this kind of a business for a long, long time. I don't think this game is anywhere close to over. We have a great opportunity there.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. Gary, you mentioned that the foundry is stronger in the second half. I was wondering if you can provide us some comments on the linearity of next year for your overall silicon business. Is it stronger in the first half or second half, and how does it compare to the second half calendar this year?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So if you go look, Farhan, this is Bob. So in 2015, WFE for the industry, we think for the total WFE was probably like 48%-52% something like that. I personally think next year WFE is all of that and maybe a little more back-end loaded because in 2015 you had foundry back-end loaded more and you get that again next year. But I think the memory is not – it's pretty good memory year by the next year but not as strong in the front end as it was this year, okay? So I think 48%-52%, it's that or more than that next year in terms of back-end load. That's for the industry. Now for Applied Materials, we always tend to be back-end loaded just because the way we run quarters and December calendar year-end. So this year, I think, we were like 57% in the second calendar half, 43%-57%. I don't want to give an exact number, but I don't know why it would be any different than that. Because I think the industry is somewhere where we're strong, foundry and V-NAND is more second half, so I think you're talking those type of numbers.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I don't want to give hard numbers, but it's similar to this year.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So, overall, it should be very similar for the overall business in terms of the linearity?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, it might even be a little more second half next year, but pretty similar.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then in terms of your capital returns, you obviously raised some debt recently. How are you thinking about the $3 billion buyback now? Do you still think it will take up to two years or do you think it will be much faster than that? Just at the rate at which you're going, it seems like you could be almost done within like a year. And second, in terms of your dividend, how are you thinking about it?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, we did $625 million in the first quarter, which wasn't a full quarter. We did $700 million on the buyback in the second quarter, that's $1,325 million. And then we have a matrix that tracks the volume by the price. So my guess is that Q3 is a good size buyback, maybe not quite as big as the – next quarter, I think, might be a good size number, somewhere between the first two quarters we did, is my guess. But it depends on the stock price, right? In terms of, we originally said we'd get done three years, then two years, it may be shorter than two years but I don't want to predict it right now, because it's based on stock prices at any given point. Oh, and the dividend is the other question. We addressed – the dividend is a board decision. We had that meeting in like February/March with the board every year. The board's always been very supportive of all forms of cash returns to investors. In fact, if you look at Applied over the last one year, three year, five year, I think even 10 years, we've returned about 100% of free cash flow to investors. So the board will talk to us about a dividend versus buyback versus other things in February/March. And I think they'll be open-minded on everything. But no decisions were made.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. That's all I had.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks for taking my question. On the Lam-KLA deal, one of the revenue synergy opportunities that they talked about as a rationale for the deal, and they put the synergies at about $600 million within five years, is on the integration rights. And the integration in situ or standalone of the process tools and the process control tools. Obviously, the Applied team has got somewhat similar capabilities on both sides. How do you see the opportunity for more process control integration with your process tools? And if they're right, then should you be looking at a similar opportunity? It would be great to get your thoughts here.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, yeah. Thanks for the question. So on, just, I want to clarify, you're talking about integrated process control, is that the question?
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, integrated process control, whether it's in situ or standalone.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Great. Yeah. Thanks. So if you look at integrated process control, the adoption has been very limited over time. There are a few examples, CMP is one. Another one that has some adoption is ASML's YieldStar product. It's not a new concept. We have a very good understanding of these opportunities, but we really can't comment on our strategy and either company's long-term road map. But I would say that we have a very, very good understanding of this particular area.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then on the AGS revenues, up 15% in fiscal year 2015. Solid performance, the team has been focusing on its services and monetizing its manufacturing IP and knowhow. Within the framework for a flat WFE spending year next year, do you expect your AGS business to outgrow the industry and outgrow your overall SSG business in fiscal year 2016 as well?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We think AGS has a very good opportunity to grow their revenue line next year, and I think they're in very good shape to hit the model we put up for 2018. In terms of whether they outgrow the semi business or not, and a lot of variables in terms of WFE spending. But I think they're going to have a strong year. They had a really great year this year.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yep. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. Hi, Gary, Bob. Just a follow-up question about DRAM WFE in 2016 being down significantly. Do you think DRAM as a percentage of WFE goes back to 14% of total WFE, compared to 25%? Is that kind of the way to think about your definition of being down significantly?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I don't want to give a hard number. We think it's down, but not down that far.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks for sharing that. And then just a follow-up question on market share. It sounds like you're Etch and deposition market share did quite well this year. Now that Lam and KLA are combining, is this typically a time that Applied will take even more market share in Etch, deposition, and maybe even in inspection as those companies look to integrate?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, what I would say in Etch, deposition and inspection, we have, as I said earlier, incredible pull from customers in Etch and deposition. Especially as they're moving to new device technologies. There's a lot of new materials that are going to be implemented where we have a very strong position. I talked about the number of applications wins earlier. So we already have very strong pull from customers, with the enabling technologies, the new platforms that we have implemented in those areas. Also very, very strong pull from customers on inspection. Deeper technologies engagements than we've ever had before, as our customers are moving to these new device structures. And really a great opportunity, really great opportunity. Strong pull from customers.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. Bob, I'm assuming flat WFE next year, AGS sales up. How should we think about OpEx dollars in terms of absolute dollars into next year?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: For the whole company?
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, we'll be year – fiscal year – fiscal, yeah, we'd like to be down a little bit, or flat to down a little bit.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then as a follow-up, I believe there was a $13 million small negative adjustment in the backlog, can you talk about what – where that was? Was it in silicon? And which end market?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, we had a backlog adjustment earlier in the year in foundry, as you remember, and then I think we had some FX. Hold on. I'm looking it up. $13 million was – yeah, there's a cancellation. There's a bunch of small ones, really. There's no big pattern. Currency adjust was $27 million. That's buried in there too. So those $27 million was foreign exchange, $24 million in SSG, $3 million in solar. So a lot of it was foreign exchange movement too.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And one last one. On the services side, is it possible to provide some kind of percentage for 200 millimeter refurbished equipment? Is it more like 10%, 20% of your services sales or higher?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'm sorry. I missed – I didn't hear the whole question.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): The 200 millimeter refurbished equipment sales as a percentage of overall services sales?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, we don't break that out. What we've said is that it was strong year for 200 millimeter tool sales, up a fair amount from last year. And we think it'll be pretty strong next year too. There's couple of big demand drivers there. One is, you don't quite realize it, but your average cellphone's got a lot of sensors in there, so a lot of those sensors are made of 200 millimeter devices. The second is, the whole automobile and sensors business is growing quite a bit. So both of those look like they'll be pretty good next year too.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks. And I think, Kyle, we have time for just about one more question, please.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific Crest. Your line is open.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your comments on inspection, where you said you're seeing very strong customer pull. Was that more related to just the new UVision platform or were you referring to E-Beam inspection? And if it was E-Beam related, I'm wondering if you can give us an idea of how much of a revenue contribution that could be in 2016?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so in UVision we have a good position in foundry and logic. Also we had a recent multiple tool order in memory for the UVision 7, so we're making progress there in that part of the business. On the E-Beam area, again, as I said before, we have really very strong electron optics. We've got a strong position in E-Beam review and putting all that together, we think it's a great opportunity for us. We're not ready to quantify the exact number in terms of the potential there, but it is a fast growing part of the market and with the technology and the team we have, we think that it's a good opportunity going forward.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, that that helps. And then as a follow-up, I was wondering, on the last call you said you were ramping down some businesses and you plan to cut anything really sustainably below 20% OP margin and I was just wondering if there were any significant cuts this quarter that you could talk about.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Well, it's hard to talk about those in advance. We consistently screen all the businesses. The one that consistently we're ramping down is the solar business, frankly, because the market is bad. Right? But other than that we don't have much we would talk about right now.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: All right. Thank you, Wes. And we'd like to thank, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Kyle. Today we'll discuss the results for our third quarter, which ended on July 26. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including Applied's current view of its industries, performance, products, share positions, profitability, and business outlook. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied's most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with SEC. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections, and assumptions as of August 13, 2015, and Applied assumes no obligation to update them. Today's call also includes non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investors page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. At our recent analyst event at SEMICON West, we outlined how Applied Materials is focused on delivering profitable growth. Overall, the company is executing well, as seen in our third quarter results, where we delivered our highest quarterly earnings in the past four years, the highest service revenue in our history, and more than $2 billion of 300-millimeter semi equipment orders, which is also a record. While progress towards our strategic goals and financial model remains on track, changes in the business environment over the past few weeks have created some near-term headwinds. Looking at the market as a whole, we now see 2015 wafer fab equipment spending being approximately flat relative to 2014, with potential downside risk. The most substantial revision to our outlook is foundry spending, where we have lowered our estimates for the remainder of the calendar year. This is primarily due to customers managing excess inventory, improving their yields, and reusing equipment. While we see a pause in capacity additions, the leading foundries are still aggressively pursuing 10-nanometer technology, and we expect this to become a key battleground in 2016 with the buildout of pilot production. As we have discussed before, the 10-nanometer node expands the available market for Applied and plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses. With the majority of development tool selections already made, we are confident about our growth opportunities at this node. In logic, we do not see any major changes to our previous outlook, and the cadence of our development roadmap remains tightly aligned with our customers' needs. In memory, 2015 continues to be a year of strong investment. DRAM bit growth is in the 20% to 30% range, with supply and demand more or less balanced. We maintain our view that 2015 DRAM spending will be around 20% higher than last year, driven by 20-nanometer upgrades and some capacity additions. Most significantly, we are increasingly optimistic about the pace of the transition from planar to 3D NAND. Our customers are telling us they are under significant pressure to ramp this technology faster because of its performance and reliability advantages. Consequently, we see the buildout of 3D broadening and accelerating. We expect installed capacity will now surpass 150,000 wafer starts per month by the end of calendar 2015. While this number is higher than anticipated at the start of the year, it only represents around 15% of total NAND capacity. These are still the early phases of the buildout. And as the adoption of 3D NAND speeds up, it will become a more meaningful driver of Applied's growth. Our NAND orders were at an all-time high this quarter, and we expect our combined etch and CVD share at these customers to grow between seven and 10 points during the 3D NAND inflection. 3D NAND is also enabling us to expand the available market for our epi products by between 5% to 10%. In display, the shift to 4K TVs and larger average screen sizes is sustaining area growth in the 10% range, which supports ongoing investment in new TV capacity. In mobility, our customers continue to invest in LTPS for high-resolution screens, and the penetration of OLED displays is ahead of our prior forecast. We now believe that around one in five smartphones shipped in 2015 will use OLED technology. Currently, mobility makes up a large part of industry investment, and this spending mix is not as favorable for us. When combined with a weak yen, our display business faces some margin pressures over the next few quarters. However, the overall market trends are positive, and we are on track to grow in line with our financial models. As we discussed at SEMICON, the entire Applied organization is focused on delivering for our customers and shareholders. Our strategy and investments are aligned so that Applied is in the best position to address major materials innovation challenges in semiconductor and display. We have developed a very strong product portfolio targeting key inflections and are demonstrating significant traction with new products. Our Etch Sym3 chamber that we officially launched last month is one of the fastest ramping products in Applied's history. And by the end of our first quarter of 2016, we expect to have shipped around 450 chambers. This product is enabling us to grow our overall etch market share, and this year we believe we are adding to the seven points of gains we made between 2012 and 2014. In the past few weeks, we secured major application wins in 3D and patterning, giving us increased confidence that we will continue to make gains in 2016. We also have very strong pull for our Olympia ALD tool, as customers are telling us that ALD film quality is one of their top issues for 10-nanometer device performance. We are expecting to ship more than 50 chambers by the end of our first quarter. Our service business is also delivering profitable growth. Our AGS revenues were at record levels again this quarter, and 2015 remains on track to be the biggest year in our history. We have made some significant improvements to our service business and aligned our strategy to enable customer success. We have brought together capabilities from across the company so that we can deliver and capture more value with our service products. We believe that this momentum is sustainable, and service is a meaningful component of our long-term strategy for profitable growth. While we are maintaining investment in development programs that support our strategic priorities to increase share in wafer fab equipment, grow our service business, and expand our total available market, we are equally focused on reducing operating costs and the complexity of our organization. We recently made enhancements to Applied's structure that will enable us to accelerate those opportunities that are most critical to our growth. By aligning the organization around key areas of value creation, we are improving the way we collaborate with customers and speeding up the delivery of new products and services to meet key technology inflections. In parallel, as we navigate the near-term industry environment, we remain highly focused on managing our expenses and financial performance. We are carefully prioritizing R&D investments while reducing discretionary spending. To provide you with more details about the actions we are taking as well as our financial results and outlook, let me now hand the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Gary. Good afternoon and thank you for joining today's call. Applied delivered strong results in the third quarter, posting our highest revenue in the past three years. Over this period, we have repositioned the company to capitalize on key inflections in foundry, logic, and memory and increase our share of WFE. As Gary has already mentioned, our strong position in foundry will drive further growth when 10 nanometers ramps next year. I'll take a moment to summarize how the changes we've made to our strategy and investments have improved our position in today's memory-driven environment. We expect memory spending to make up nearly 50% of WFE in 2015 compared to less than 25% in 2012. Over the same timeframe, Applied's memory revenue is on track to grow by more than 150%. We are significantly outpacing the market and believe we are gaining four points of market share in both DRAM and NAND. Within NAND, the 3D inflection is gaining momentum with a broader set of customers. Based on new product positions across the customer base, our share of 3D NAND spending is now approaching the high levels of share we have in foundry. At the product level, our substantial investments in etch and CVD are having a positive impact on our results. This past quarter, we secured our second highest etch orders in the past 15 years as well as our highest CVD orders ever. Importantly, through our strong engagements with customers, we have developed a deep pipeline of new and disruptive products that give us further opportunities for share gains and profitable growth as semiconductor and display technology inflections play out over the next several years. Now I'll comment on our third quarter results. Revenues of $2.5 billion were up 10% year over year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 43.9% was slightly higher than expected, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 was at the midpoint of our range. We used $625 million to repurchase 32 million shares of stock, deploying more than 20% of our three-year, $3 billion buyback authorization in the first quarter of the program. We will continue to be opportunistic with the buyback. Including dividends, we returned nearly $750 million to shareholders. Next I will make some comments on our segments. Silicon system orders of $2 billion were up 18% sequentially and set a record. This performance was led by strong 3D NAND momentum across multiple customers, notably in Japan where revenue is recognized upon sign-off. Backlog was at an eight-year high, net of an $84 million reduction due mostly to an order cancellation in foundry. We also significantly reduced our Q4 foundry forecast. AGS posted a second consecutive quarter of record revenue and remains on track for a record year. Display orders more than doubled sequentially, including a large order for our new CVD encapsulation tool for OLED displays. Next let me provide some additional insight into our gross margin and OpEx patterns. Over the past two years, we have made significant progress with our gross margins. But this year, we are experiencing headwinds due to mix effects and the higher initial cost of new products. As Gary explained, overall WFE demand is trending lower versus earlier forecasts, with memory higher and foundry lower. We are seeing exceptionally strong pull for our new semiconductor products. And in display, our revenue mix is rapidly shifting to mobile. Taking these factors into consideration, we are modeling Q4 non-GAAP gross margin to be down by about two points sequentially. We are driving actions to improve gross margins, particularly for our new products in high-growth markets. We are also reducing our operating expenses. Our non-GAAP OpEx was $576 million in Q3. In Q4 we plan to reduce it to $555 million plus or minus $10 million. We took further actions in solar, where we discontinued our wafer saw and solar implant product lines, resulting in one-time charges of approximately $51 million in the third quarter. In summary, 2015 wafer fab equipment spending is trending lower than our prior expectations. Our focus on technology inflections and new products is producing revenue and share growth opportunities, notably in memory. But the demand mix presents gross margin challenges in the short term. Over the model horizon, we expect the mix to return to levels that are more consistent with historical patterns and more favorable from a gross margin perspective. In the meantime, we are heavily focused on gross margin improvements and operating expense reductions. Now I will provide a fourth quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to down 7% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect silicon system net sales to be down 6% to 12%. AGS net sales should be approximately flat. We expect display net sales to be up by 25% to 35%. And EES net sales should be approximately $55 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.31. Now I will turn the call over to Mike for questions.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Kyle, let's please begin.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. Just regarding the October quarter, I wanted to probe you on the order trends. It seems that the revenues are declining despite very strong orders that you had in the July quarter, so I'm thinking there is probably a 25%-ish decline in the October quarter. This is the orders, so I just wanted to probe you. What segments are you seeing the decline? And considering that you have very strong orders in NAND, I just wanted to understand how sustainable are the order trends. Do you think that they are peaking in July, or do you think just because we are now in the 3D era, we will just start to see much higher order run rate in NAND?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, let me take a shot at it and Gary can join in. We had really strong orders in Q3, so you might say shouldn't your revenues be a little stronger in Q4? As you go look at our press release we put out today, we get a fair amount of orders in Japan, in fact. And in Japan, we recognize revenue usually a quarter after we ship. So some of the orders we booked this quarter will trail into the next several quarters in terms of shipments and revenue recognition. So that's a little bit of a disconnect between our strong orders this quarter and the revenues, which are a little less robust next quarter but give you higher than typical backlog from this quarter that we'll sustain into Q1. The second thing in terms of what's our outlook, I'll give you my observations. I think you have a couple of different things going on. In V-NAND, which I think more and more people are resonating, there's a lot of momentum around that for several reasons. One, there's more and more data that suggests that the V-NAND flash device is a superior device in terms of performance. And then the second thing is you can't sustain planar shrink effectively. So the push to go to V-NAND is picking up momentum if anything. And the second aspect to that is that that is particularly good for Applied on many levels. The first is that V-NAND is much more deposition, etch, RTP, CMP, and even some epi intensive than 2D. The second thing is the tool mix is somewhat different, so the level of reuse for us is much less. So we actually do say, and I believe it's very accurate and you're starting to see it in the bookings, that the opportunity for Applied from the planar shrink mode, which was primarily reuse, and most of the incremental CapEx might have been tilted toward lithography to a V-NAND mode where a lot of it is not available for use, is about a 3x revenue opportunity for Applied. So that's my outlook that I think V-NAND bullish on for a while, including next year. In terms of foundry, we are saying we're seeing it a little softer. In fact, one of the significant reasons why our gross margins in Q4 were down and less than we expected even a couple months ago was that the mix has changed on us. We're seeing strong memory, but we're not quite seeing the foundry we might have anticipated. And we had to scratch our own heads on that because how does that tie to the outside world? What we're coming up with is that the things that have been talked about in the last couple months in the outside world; that is, customers are reusing equipment more effectively and efficiently, particularly as they bought a little conservatively to have very good ramps for their customers in the foundries in the last year or two, that tool reuse is creating a little bit of a slowdown at this point. Now that doesn't mean we think it's not positive next year, but they're more effectively using those tools they bought earlier in the cycle. And the second thing we read about and hear about, they're continue to improve yields. They're continuing to improve tool utilizations quite high too. So what we see in foundry is, in our fourth quarter, it's less than we anticipated. And we even saw, as we mentioned in my notes, that we had about an $8 million push-out of a foundry booking – or a cancellation rather. Now what does that mean prospectively? We're not pessimistic on foundry at all. The question is when do they, A), get through this full utilization of some of these tools. And two, how does 10-nanometer do? So we haven't spoken to November – December yet, but we are relatively positive actually on next year on 10-nanometer. And for Applied specifically, the mix of tools at 10-nanometer is very positive. I think we have about a 20% to 30% bigger opportunity. And as we get through this reuse gap, that should help us on our revenue, our share, and our gross margins, frankly. But that's what we're getting through.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. And just looking at the stock repurchases, you had $625 million of stock repurchases, which is quite a bit higher than what we would have expected at your $2 billion in first year – sorry, $2 billion worth run rate. With the stock where it is, could you be more opportunistic in the near term?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Mechanically, let me tell you how we do this. At the beginning before we started the stock buyback plan, we put together a thoughtful – I hate to call myself thoughtful, but I think it was thoughtful, the Treasury department was, a matrix, and what you do is a buyback grid. And you see at various stock prices we will buy various dollar prices per day, and that pricing grid has given a lot of analysis to long-term valuation of the company in terms of net present value, intrinsic value, short-term valuations versus multiples and earnings. And when you cross certain price points, you buy more stock back. And the stock went down this quarter, and it triggered that more aggressive buyback. At the end of this quarter we will revisit with our board the price grid and the volume grid, and we'll reset it or not. You don't typically reset them a lot because a lot of the valuation there is what do you think the intrinsic and long-term value of the enterprise is. So my guess is that our pricing grid as it exists gives us fair amount of flexibility to be aggressive at the type of stock prices we're seeing. And I think that would naturally lead us to be opportunistic because we see long-term value in the company.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you, that's all I have.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, guys, thanks, good afternoon. On the foundry issues, obviously I think the questions from the market are going to be are the foundry issues cyclical or secular, and obviously you addressed a little bit of that. And then the other question I think clients will have is how do we know it's not share loss because I think some other companies have reported and they haven't seen these declines to this extent. Maybe it's a calendar issue where you guys are a month later and you've seen it, but obviously those will be the questions. So could you help us on the secular versus cyclical versus the share loss question that I'm sure will come up tomorrow?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. If you go look at secular versus cyclical, I think some of it's timing and some of it other people have talked about it. You see our customers talking about it. We're getting higher tool utilization. Samsung talked about it earlier in the year. TSMC has started to talk about that, higher tool utilization, more tool reuse. So that's across – and even inventory in the channel, you see some data on that. So I think what you have right now is a problem in fuller utilization, more efficient utilization of tools. Now I think they're getting through that. You might argue could we have seen some of this? Maybe, higher tool utilization, greater reuse of tools, it's hard for us to measure it because it factors in with yield and all that stuff, which we have no insight to. So I think there's a good part of this that is a cyclical thing, this window we're in here. In terms of why do we see it and other people aren't talking about it, we are a month later, number one. Number two, if you do look at the mix of Applied tools, sometimes they're about a little bit earlier and heavier in a cycle. For instance, our epi tools take a while to qualify. They're complex tools, and customers bought a little heavier earlier. PV tools tend to be back-end interconnect to a lot of that stuff, so these tools get bought a little bit earlier. And then if you look at tools like that, our share is very strong and our tools are enabling in those areas. So there is no share loss there and we're seeing some volumes down there, frankly.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think also, Jim, if you look at it from a market share perspective, in foundry, that's our strongest position. Now the good news is that as the memory business is ramping, also our share is up. Bob talked about this earlier, several points in memory, so that's helping us offset some of the weakness in the foundry business. But if you look at our leadership products, we talked about this at Investor Day. We're up 5% in the leadership products over the last couple years, launching some great new products in those areas. And so that combined with our momentum in the etch business with the Sym3, highest ever CVD orders, new ALD position, we look at our position for 10-nanometer, and we're very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow share in foundry. Right now the mix is working against us in terms of foundry versus memory. The good news again is we have gained share in memory. We have good momentum there, but we also have a very strong position in foundry.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Jim, I'll tell you another way you can triangulate on what we're saying. We have two primary U.S. competitors. One is generally thought of as more memory centric; one is thought of as more foundry and logic centric. And if you look at it, the person who is more memory centric probably a month ago saw a little bit better outlook than we did. And the one who is more foundry and logic centric saw a significantly less optimistic, I believe, outlook than we did. And because we've repositioned the company, we're more closely towards the memory, whereas if you looked a couple years ago we were more closely to the foundry model. So I think, one, if you look at our peers and say what is our positioning in those, we're somewhere in the middle, but we've moved a lot more holistically towards good representation in memory too. But if you think about those two other companies too, it makes sense.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And so maybe as a follow-up, picking up on that point, I know and I think everybody in the market knows that you guys are incredibly well positioned in 3D NAND, and it will be a good really positive inflection for you all. And I believe you're gaining share in the other segments, as you commented. At what point is it fair for us to look at the company's revenue on a year-over-year basis versus the overall industry revenue and see those share gains coming through? Is the idea that that's just going to be a little bit further out where we can look at Applied's revenue growing significantly in excess of the overall industry growth rate to measure that share gain in the company-specific results?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You have some indicators. I'll try and then Gary will jump in. You have some indicators now, Jim, that aren't too bad. People have said this year is – different people said different numbers, but some people have said $33 billion WFE. We haven't updated it, but we're a little bit more conservative than that, frankly. And so if you look at that, we had record orders this quarter. I think in SSG we're going to be close to a record for the year in orders in semi. I don't know if we'll be exactly there, but we're in pretty damn good shape. If you look at our service businesses, which implies that we're servicing more tools, that's a record, and display is pretty good. Now you're talking mostly about semi. If you look at share within product, it's up. If you look at WFE share, the last couple years it has been up. So there are some existing indicators. And then as we said at Analyst Day, we have some product positioning stuff that's going out. Now a little bit of wind at our back; it was a good foundry in the last couple years, so I'll give you the math that's in my head. If you look at the – it's $7.7 billion or $7.8 billion, whatever the number is, between $7.5 billion and $8 billion for both DRAM and NAND this year WFE. We've gained over four points on each I think. And so if you take four points times $8 billion, that's about $320 million each that if we hadn't repositioned ourselves we'd be short $640 million there. Two years ago we had $2 billion in semi, services in AGS. This year we'll be close to $2.6 billion, and a couple hundred million dollars of that is positioning. So I think through the repositioning will company and the products we have in the pipeline, you can see more robust revenues arguably with this mix of probably $600 million, $700 million, $900 million.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thank you so much.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Ada Menaker - Evercore ISI: Hi, this is Ada calling in for C.J. Could you guys talk a little bit about how the economics for AMAT changed in memory in 2016 given that more of the DRAM CapEx will be spent on shrinks as opposed to new wafer starts, and in 3D NAND on new wafers and conversions as opposed to largely greenfield in 2015?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: What was your point? Say it again about 3D. What did you say about 3D?
Ada Menaker - Evercore ISI: In 3D, next year is going to be more new wafers and conversions and this year is more greenfield. What does that do to the economics for you guys?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think on 3D NAND, I'll start and then Bob can join in. Thanks for the question. So 3D NAND, as we have talked about before, is really more materials-enabled than litho-enabled scaling. So if you look at the CapEx that is necessary for them to ramp those devices, it's very heavily weighted toward CVD, etch. Also, we have epi there for the first time in memory where we have a very strong position. So as the customers are ramping those 3D NAND factories, the areas that are growing are the areas where we are gaining share. That's part of what Bob talked about earlier, where he said we're gaining several points of share in 3D NAND. And if we look at the products that we're introducing, the Sym3 Etch, the record CVD orders, again, a number of our products are very well positioned as the customers ramp 3D NAND spending. So we believe that 3D NAND is at about 15% of the total NAND capacity. We believe that that is going to continue to ramp in 2016 as a percentage of total spending, and we're in a very, very, very strong position there. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think that's true. I think the big inflection that's going on in the industry right now is 3D NAND, and it's going to go on for years. There are about 1.3 billion wafers out there. There's about 150 million by the end of this year that are done. I think that's a bigger inflection than DRAM. Within DRAM, we're a little bit more bullish than somebody like Dataquest. We see that they didn't really add that much capacity this year. If you look at die sizes, they're bigger, if you look at more process steps, so they didn't really add that much capacity this year. So we're a little bit more bullish than some of the outside folks on total DRAM spending next year. And then as we mentioned earlier, our position in DRAM, in the last couple years we gained four points.
Ada Menaker - Evercore ISI: Great, thank you. And can you maybe just dive a little bit deeper into gross margin and how much of the headwind is coming from display versus how much is coming from SSG?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Display is a good size gross margin headwind now. It could be up to a point for the company. And what's going on there is historically for many years, 80% and even a few years ago 90% of our business in display was for TVs, equipment for making displays for TVs. We project that next year over 50% will be for small screens, so your cell phone and stuff. So the good news is, if you go back a few years ago, if TVs had turned down like this, we'd be losing a lot of money in display because there would be no revenues. In fact, we think revenues will be pretty strong next year in display because over 50% of our business will be small screen sizes and that we are growing the TAM there. This is the third year in a row we have grown display revenues, but next year with the TV downturn we're still pretty damn healthy. So the issue is gross margins there. So if you look at that, we're penetrating some new products in some new markets, and some of our new competition is Japanese yen based. So the display thing is bad probably through the first couple quarters of fiscal 2016, but it gets a little better each quarter and then we pick it up, and that's when our mix gets more normal. We start to get some TV business back and the product mix changes a little bit. It's about a point now. The other piece is SSG, where the big mix delta for us is foundry versus memory, and that's really just indicative of the tool mix. And the tool mix is stronger for us right now, things like etch and memory, whereas in foundry we're a little stronger in places like epi, PVD, inspection.
Ada Menaker - Evercore ISI: Great, thank you so much.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks for taking my question, two of them. First one, Bob, to follow up on the gross margin side, so if your January revenues might come up because of the Japanese revenue recognition, should we assume gross margins will still be under pressure given the fact that display is going to continue, and so would SSG pressures? In other words, would revenues improve in January sequentially but margins be under pressure? And then I also had a follow-up.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, so just to give you the economic model of Applied Materials, in some industries if volumes go up, gross margins naturally benefit because they get absorption issues in their factories. A company like Applied Materials and our peers, predominantly our product cost is materials, stuff we buy, so you don't get this big absorption boost or downtick either with volume. So our gross margins are predominantly a function of mix, mix between customers, mix between products. So I don't have a clear view on the Q1 yet. But given I've got pretty good backlog right now, I'm concerned that the mix issues we're seeing in Q4 will stay into Q1 and we'll have the same type of challenges in Q1. Now if you say, Bob, what have you been saying all along? I think last quarter and even maybe at Analyst Day, I was somewhat concerned about exactly this issue, frankly, in fiscal Q1 and Q2, the heavy volume of etch and the display mix with small screen sizes. What's been a little bit different for us is Q4 I thought would be a little bit heavier foundry mix than it turned out to be.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then the follow-up is you guys had almost just shy of $800 million in NAND bookings in July. Is there any way to parse it to say how much of that was 3D NAND?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, there is. NAND ramp is going up significantly towards 3D each quarter. I'd say – let me see if I have it here. We're looking for the data, but my guess is that in the quarter we just ended, the great majority of it was 3D.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. Bob, I guess my first question is again on gross margin. It really isn't different than it was a few years ago at this revenue level. And I certainly get the new product issue and the mix items and the flat panel issues. But people are going to say – they're going to say look, they're just buying market share or they're gaining unprofitable low-end share. So I just wanted to give you a chance to say hey, that's not what's actually happening here because that's what people are going to say. And I guess maybe just talk about where gross margin would be a year from today at this revenue level once you normalize all these factors out. Then I had a follow-up, thanks.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, thanks for the question, Tim, a couple of things. I had tasked our internal people with the same question to make sure it's not happening, so let me see if I can go through the details because I've been through the details. As I was just asked, one full point of it in the short term is display. In display, you're not hearing that from display competitors of us. It's mostly mix. You can see we're selling a lot more into the small screen sizes, a little bit more in PVD, for instance, than CVD. So it's definitely mix in there. Does it make it a little worse that our competitors are Japanese? Maybe, but mix is the biggest single delta in there. The second issue is semi, where you hear more contrarian views from other people. So I went through – the biggest delta is mix between some of our higher gross margin products, our PVD, epi, and inspection. And so some of the lower ones for us are etch. So you could see the mix is more weighted towards foundry for the first, and for etch it's more weighted towards memory. And you see the foundry/memory mix happening, so you know we're getting a bigger mix. So then you'll drill into me and say are you being hyper-competitive on etch, for instance? So I went through by deal what we've been doing in etch cost, the pricing. And our prices were – our peers, our competitors were very much the same type of prices, arguably higher. So what we've got there is a cost issue and a mix issue. Our competitors have a different mix of products and, frankly, they have a more mature product. So what we have to do is get cost out in our products and start to get the mix across all of our products. So the roadmap for us is let's get some more normal level of mix between memory and foundry. And particularly within foundry, let's get the normal level of things like epi, PVD, inspection. And then with etch, let's get our costs down and continue to get costs down and configurations down.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks a lot for that. And then I guess really for you, Gary, this is a big-picture question, but it really is about your thought process around really shaking things up a little bit. The stock has certainly underperformed. If you look at the next worst peer, it's underperformed the next worst peer by 1,000 basis points over the past six months. I know that much of that is due to the failed merger, but you can't be happy with that. I guess my question is about really shaking things up, maybe cleaning off some of the businesses, maybe pulling in the buyback, maybe getting out of some big markets you're in that are not as high margin, really a question around your thought process around that because the stock has significantly underperformed I think even your expectations. Thanks.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think we outlined the strategy at the investor meeting. As Bob talked about, we've been positioning the company around the major inflections. So if you look at the way we structured the organization, the way we move the investment within the company in patterning, for instance, in etch and CVD, we've got the highest CVD orders ever in the history of the company; etch, the second highest orders in the history of the company this last quarter. And our memory share is increasing. So we look at each of these different markets and really try to figure out, like you talked about, what moves the needle. Where are we going to invest? How are we going to structure the company around those inflections so that we're positioned when those new devices ramp? So patterning, again, tremendous momentum there. We talked about the 450 Sym3 chambers. It's really from in a five-quarter period of time we're going from 18 chambers in the field to 450. And you asked the question about the margins relative to buying market share. We're winning in critical applications with a higher price than the competitors in many of the cases where Bob and I went through the analysis. So there are some real technical advantages of those products that, again, we went through some of those at SEMICON. So it's focusing in this patterning inflection, focusing around the transistor and interconnect area. As 10-nanometer technologies ramp, we're in very, very strong DTOR positions. In service, we also made a number of changes there to really drive higher value and lower cost in our service business. And we believe as these inflections happen for our customers, these are tough inflections. They have to ramp quickly, get to high yield fast. And so that's another area that we focused on where we've seen hundreds of millions of dollars in growth. And we really believe that that's another area where we fundamentally repositioned the company for more sustainable growth going forward into the future. And then, as Bob talked about in display, a few hundred million dollars of growth there, expanding as our customers move into some of these new technologies like OLED within film encapsulation. So we believe all of those areas are fundamentally stronger than where we've been in the past around all those different segments of the business. Now the other thing that we did is we cut $400 million of OpEx. We cut G&A by about 25%. We've cut many areas that were low performing. We continue to look for those areas. We talked about some other businesses that we're ramping down right now, and we will continue to look for those lower performing businesses. Anything that we don't see that is going to be a good return and generate somewhere around at least a 20% operating profit, we have zero bias about being in those businesses. So from a top level standpoint, we've moved the money. We've structured the company around the areas that we believe will move the needle for Applied and for our customers. And the model that we presented at SEMICON, the $2.00 model, we believe we're on track. If you look at the indicators around the major areas of our business, we are gaining share. Now the mix in the near term – you look at that long-term model. But the mix in the near term, the foundry versus memory, mobility versus TV, those are things that are headwinds for us. But fundamentally we're in a much better position and confident that we're going to achieve that model.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, Gary. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes, thank you. You guys have mentioned that WFE this year, your expectation now is that it's flat, but the risk is to the downside, and I wonder. How does the weakness this year change your view on spending for 2016?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'll take a shot at that; Gary can jump in. We think some of the weakness we're seeing towards the end of this year is this tool reuse, increasing yields, and absorption of the capacity they have, as they go into foundries in particular because memory is pretty strong. DRAM was strong at the beginning of the year. We're more bullish than your average outside guy for next year DRAM. In NAND, I don't think anyone is too pessimistic right now. We're optimistic, actually. So it's a discussion on foundry spending and timing. So if you go look at it, we believe that in listening to our customers, 10-nanometer is going to be a pretty big spend year for them next year. So the rough mathematics is that if you look node to node, so the 32-nanometer to 28-nanometer versus 2016 14-nanometer versus 10-nanometer, wafer starts might be down a little bit, maybe 10% per launch, but capital intensity per node is up about 20%, so the volume versus capital intensity is still not bad. I think the problem we have right now is we get this reuse. Now the other thing you have to go look at is all the macro stuff, which is beyond my pay grade. What's going to happen in China in phones and the next Apple phone? I don't know that stuff. But in a reasonable demand environment, the increasing capital intensity and the importance of 10-nanometer to our customers and the fact they're absorbing the tools at this point means it's probably okay.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: If the PC and the smartphone TAMs remain under some pressure, Gary, are you more inclined to pursue growth via acquisitions?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that from a top-level standpoint, we are improving our position in memory, so that's the good news. If you look at the point, the share gain that we have in both DRAM and flash, that's helping us offset some of the near-term weakness in foundry. So for us to hit the financial model, you have to believe that the mix comes back to some normal relationship between the foundry and the memory, and we think that's going to happen. But certainly, if you look at our position in epi, PVD, implant, thermal products, CMP, you have to have a more normal mix than we've seen over the last few years for that part of our product portfolio to work. So mix certainly plays a big role in the overall financials.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So I just want to be clear on this point. Is it fair to say that M&A is no longer part of the company's growth strategy?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So M&A, basically what we've said is there are three things that drive our M&A strategy. Number one, can we get a good ROI? Number two, is it an opportunity for a leadership business? Because in most areas, the number one guy makes a lot of money, number two breaks even, everybody else loses money. And then the third area for us is synergy with our core businesses. So good ROI, opportunity for a leadership business, and synergy with the rest of our products. We look across semi today; there aren't many of those types of opportunities. So now around our core competencies in materials engineering, those are areas that we will continue to look at. But today, I would say there aren't that many attractive opportunities that we see that fit those three criteria.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Romit, I think Gary is – that's the essence of the feedback. I'll give you a little bit more color. One is the TEL deal had the big tax leverage. So that was extra benefit, and that made everything easier, but we still have some tax leverage that if we were ever interested in a foreign company and use our foreign cash, you get about a 50% discount if you think about it. So I'm not saying we're doing it. I'm just saying that's another consideration, all the financial and tax leverage that's sometimes there.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. At Analyst Day at SEMICON, you guys articulated a view of $2.2 billion of OpEx in fiscal year 2016. I think July quarter run rate was about $2.3 billion. The October quarter guidance takes you guys down to that $2.2 billion annualized. So given the weaker fundamental environment, should we expect OpEx to trend even lower beyond the October quarter, and you do guys have a new view on OpEx for fiscal year 2016?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'll give you some color without being too specific. The model we put up in July of 2013 was at $2.2 billion – $2.8 billion actually in fiscal 2016. We trended up over that a little bit in the last year or so, so that our run rate last quarter was $579 million. So it was about $2.3 billion or something like that. So we were a little bit above that because we had one more year of inflation. And what we've done is we've – and part of the reason we're a little bit above those companies, one, we were tied up in the merger. There were certain things we couldn't address, and we have a lot of products coming out of the pipeline right now. But we've engaged more, a brighter microscope on OpEx, so next quarter we're at $555 million. And we're working to get down our OpEx back to the original number we guided for 2016, which was the $2.2 billion – $2.8 billion. We said we'd have a number in 2018 of $2.4 billion, so we're optimistic we'll hit that. And we've got renewed vigor to be opportunistic on OpEx.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, got it. And then on the display side, a lot of discussion on the gross margin front. But at the operating margin level, your display margins declined by over 700 basis points. Is the operating margin pressure more the revenue decline? Is it the yen? Is it the mix? And then on your commentary on margins being bad for the next few quarters in display, do you expect operating margins here to trend in this sub-20% range going forward?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think the next couple quarters through Q2 are a little challenging because we've got so much of this new product, new market stuff. But I think longer term, those guys are going to do well. It's unprecedented for us to have over 50% of our revenues in display next year. The good news is, think about it. If you didn't have that, you'd have another $400 million revenue hole or whatever. So it's not where we want to be. It will get better. But for the next couple quarters, it's going to be around there.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think as Bob said, the biggest headwind there for us is mix of mobility versus TV. And if you look at the normal mix that we've seen over the last few years, the operating profit there has been continuing to improve. The revenue is up. And we're in this situation where we believe it will come back to a more normal mix. And actually, we're bullish about the operating profit and revenue increasing as we've seen over the last few years. But this near-term mix is certainly working against us.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Hi, Bob and Gary, just another follow-up question on NAND. I just wanted to know if you could share your early view on 3D NAND wafer builds for next year. I just want to get a sense how comfortable you were that this year is not the peak year for 3D NAND spend for Applied.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'll take a shot at it. We believe the installed capacity exit 2014 was about 60,000 – 65,000 wafer starts per month. We think this year exit is about 150,000 wafer starts per month. We think exit 2016 is about 300,000 wafer starts per month, so we think it's doubling every year. This year they had about 85,000 – 90,000 wafer starts per month. The year before they were 40,000 wafer starts per month. So we're going like 40,000 wafer starts per month, 90,000 wafer starts per month, and next year is maybe 150,000 wafer starts per month. It's going up.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, thanks a lot.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: A lot of that booking stuff we got is next year NAND, 3D NAND.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Great, that helps. Thanks, Bob. My follow-up question was on foundry being the swing factor next year. I was just wondering what you think happens when foundry 10-nanometer pilot orders are eventually placed. Do you think it's a steady ramp with this foundry 10-nanometer, or could it be a hockey stick type of spend given some of the complexity of 10-nanometer? Thanks.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'll give you my best wrong answer. Typically what happens is that customers will buy X amount of capacity pretty early on so they have it, and then they'll see how well it yields and demand for it. So it's not unusual that they might do – committed to 30,000 wafer starts say roughly. And then we get the vigorish or the extras if it's yielding well, and then a lot of tape-outs and extra sales. So I think you've got a baseline in the next year that you can count on. And getting to the higher numbers, which we all believe in, is how does 10-nanometer yield, how many customers buy it, what's the tape-outs, all that stuff. So you've got a baseline that you're probably okay on, and then the rest we don't know yet.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Great, thanks for sharing the color, Bob.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Sundeep Bajikar from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Sundeep Madan Bajikar - Jefferies LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question, a question on foundry again. Can we attribute the majority of the foundry weakness you described primarily to one of your large customer's public commentary about CapEx reduction and tool reuse from 20-nanometer to 16-nanometer, or are you describing much more broad-based weakness across multiple customers here?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think the general notion is that customers have improved yields, that customers are getting more effective tool utilization this year versus the last year or two where they bought a little heavier, because some of them shared the same concerns about ramping FinFETs and ramping for big customers. Those are common, more efficient utilization yield from a number of customers. The cancellations we had in Q3 out of our backlog was one specific customer. The softness we see in our Q4 forecast versus what we expect is a couple customers.
Sundeep Madan Bajikar - Jefferies LLC: Thanks so much, that's helpful. And just as a follow-up on the 10-nanometer opportunity, how much of the size of the opportunity growth you're looking at would be driven by capacity expansion compared to a higher process complexity next year?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: On 3D NAND?
Sundeep Madan Bajikar - Jefferies LLC: No, 10-nanometer foundry.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: 10-nanometer foundry, we think that from 2016 – 2014 when you go to TAM, it's about 20% to 30%. It's higher process complexity, more layers, stuff like that, so the back end they're going to redo at 10-nanometer, and there are other things they're going to do. So it's 20% to 30% for the same number of wafer starts capital intensity, so that's complexity. Then you've got to get the volume stuff, which I talked about earlier. And we think the reuse thing has been largely wrung out of the system we hope this year. And then finally, the last thing you've got to put in your polynomial equation is what's the end user consumption of those devices.
Sundeep Madan Bajikar - Jefferies LLC: Great, very helpful. Thank you.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi thanks for taking my questions. I guess similar to a question asked earlier but looking a little longer term, if you look at the demand side, PC is declining year over year. Smartphones are peaking out, and now Moore's Law seems to be pushing out, which I'm curious about your view there. How should we think about the WFE spending growth going forward over the next few years rather than just next year? And is it just the spending being spread over a longer period of time?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'll take a shot at it again. Let's segment the market. WFE – 3D NAND we're pretty bullish on actually because this is a technology transition which is more akin to a wafer size transition because when they have to switch from 2D to 3D for both device performance. And you can't keep shrinking; electrons in a cell, you can't get any smaller, and so you can't effectively. So they're going to go to 3D. It's like 300-millimeter, you knew customers were going to go; it's just timing. So they waited a year or two, but it's happening. You can see the numbers going up rapidly, and everybody says it. So I think if anything, you've got a solid baseline of predictable spending that's pretty healthy in 3D NAND for a number of years. On DRAM, we're a little bit more optimistic than some of our other folks because the things that are helping you there is the number of layers, capital intensity is picking up for greenfield, number one. Number two, the die sizes on average are getting bigger, particularly on mobile dies. And DRAM bit growth is pretty good, so I think DRAM is okay. And the other thing helping DRAM and memory in general is the whole data center, big data, cloud stuff is definitely a positive, definitely. Now let's go to logic. Logic hasn't been high growth for a while. It's mostly driven by PCs. And for Applied, it isn't that big either. So that one, we don't think about it every single day because it hasn't been that volatile in the last few years. So then we go to foundry. Foundry, the big driver of foundry tends to be mobile devices, and mobile devices have had very good growth. Many people continue to believe they'll be pretty good. If they're pretty good, you're in good shape because capital intensity continues to go up. As we said, it's 20% to 30% going from 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, to 10 nanometer. So if you get pretty good consumption of mobile devices and related things like that, and even some of this Internet of Things stuff is picking up frankly, then you've got healthy foundry demand. So the one that this particular quarter we were a little surprised on for next quarter was the foundry, but it doesn't mean we don't feel good about foundry fundamentals given the capital intensity and end user demand we think is good. So I think it's okay.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. My follow-up question is a little more near term. You talk about gaining four points of share in DRAM, which is great. And you also mentioned you expect DRAM orders will come to be lower in the second half versus first half, which we are seeing. What are your thoughts right now as it relates to when DRAM orders will start to grow again, especially in light of an oversupply situation this year? And related to that, do you see any downside risk for DRAM CapEx this year?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: DRAM was more heavily weighted to the first half. I've got a fancy PowerPoint around here that shows me that. And so if you look at DRAM this year, it was like 55:45 in the calendar year for us, so it was more heavily weighted to the first half. We think DRAM next year we're not as pessimistic as others. We think it's probably down but not down a lot. Maybe it's down 10%. Who the hell knows, but that's where I'm leaning. In terms of timing next year, I have a little less visibility on that.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you.
Operator: You your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific Crest. Your line is open.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just first, global services op margin trended down a bit despite record revenue. I'm just wondering if you could help us understand that discrepancy.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think it was the mix of what they sold. In other words, if you go look at those guys, they have 200-millimeter tools, spares, services. And as I remember it, the mix was a little bit different between those. Let me see if I can look at this. Yes, I think it was a mix change within their revenues more than anything else.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think long term...
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. And then...
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Just one other thing on that one. Longer term, we've seen tremendous growth in terms of revenue in the service business. We think that's sustainable, that the growth is sustainable. And we think margin growth will also improve there as we're bringing more valuable services and then focused on the key inflections for our customers.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the margin side, this would be gross margin. You mentioned that you need to get cost out of products, particularly in etch, when you were answering a question earlier. Can you just give us an idea of what some of the levers you actually have for that would be?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It's mostly material costs. There are also some opportunities in installation, warranty, and burden, overhead cost. So if you go look it with a new tool, I'll do the last one first. Inflation warranty cost tends to run higher, so we can reduce that, number one. The second thing is the chamber, which we've ramped really aggressively. Even at Analyst Day, we said we were going from a year ago five chambers a quarter or something to hundreds of chambers. And we said by the end of this calendar year at Analyst Day we'd be to 300 chambers. I don't know if you picked up on the script. I think Gary said by the end of fiscal Q1, which is one month later, January, it was 450 chambers or something like that. So that chamber is ramping super aggressively. So that's an opportunity to reduce costs. And many times you have six chambers on a tool, so there are six of those. So we'll work on that. And the other thing, even the wafer handling equipment is probably an opportunity with the platform there. So it's installation, warranty, it's burden and absorption with volume, which some of it will come relatively naturally, and then it's material cost reduction around both the chamber and the handling systems. And then also the other thing is configuration management. Can we have a little less heavily configured tools?
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. And just along those lines, have you run into any unexpected issues with installations or reliability as you've been installing these chambers that might be weighing down the gross margin?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Not too bad, it's getting better.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think if anything, the ramp is way more aggressive than we've seen in Applied for any product in the past, and so that's the good news. It makes it harder for us to drive these improvements and then have them in the bottom line as quickly. But the good news is the product is ramping, if anything, much, much faster than we had anticipated.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The other thing that's tactical in nature is to get some of the material cost through the P&L, you've got to ship the tool and revenue it. So any inventory you have, in order to cost reduce it, you have to ship that inventory first.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: All right, thank you very much.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Wes. And, Kyle, we've got time for two more questions, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Yes, good afternoon. So I haven't heard you mention advanced packaging recently. Is that still a focus to the company? And if so what's your outlook there?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We definitely have a focus on packaging. We have a pretty good position with our plating business. MDP is also a strong one for us. We don't see that being – as you look at real needle-movers on EPS, it's not a really big opportunity for us in the next year. Longer term we look at it as a growth opportunity. But relative to the other things that we're talking about, it's not in the same category.
Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. And then back on the bookings, you said that the foundries got weaker through the quarter. Is there a risk to any of the bookings you had for foundries earlier in the quarter of debooking over the next quarter or two?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: There's some risk, but a lot of that stuff in those type of customers is book-and-ship. The stuff in other customers are more backlog-weighted.
Thomas Robert Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, thank you.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Maybe as a follow-up to some of the foundry questions you've answered today, I understand with the push-outs of some of the 16-nanometer/14-nanometer capacity related to end-user demand and the higher tools utilization, is there any change in their (1:07:33) given the better tool utilization (1:07:38)?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Patrick, you were fading out on us. I think you said is there any change in their what?
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Their 10-nanometer plans, given the better tool utilization and yields at 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, I don't think so. 10-nanometer, they're still pushing aggressively. 10-nanometer, they'll probably change the back end. That will contribute to higher capital intensity. The tool utilization now, some of that high tool utilization was getting better yields on their first FinFET because that was a tricky one. The second one is not quite as worrisome. And then the third thing is some of that higher tool reuse is a natural progression from 20-nanometer, to 16-nanometer, or 20-nanometer to 14-nanometer.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And, Bob, maybe as a specific question on the operating model for you, I think I've known you long enough or well enough that the gross margin is a big focus for you guys, and you're not just going to sit idly by to let the product mix shift. Are there specific things you can do, particularly on the flat panel display side, given you mentioned the smaller mobile display product mix issues? Are there things you can do specifically to improve that over time?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, there are. That's what we're doing. We're taking down costs and material costs and overhead and installation/warranty. I have to admit that the shift in mix in the current quarter surprised me a little bit. So we're not being passive, we're pushing it hard. It just came one quarter earlier than we expected, to be honest with you. And the other thing I'll say to you, the good news, the gross margins, we definitely are committed to getting them up. We definitely believe we should have higher gross margins, no doubt about it, Gary and I rail about this every day basically. But the glass is half full on this thing. If you look at it, we've gained over four points of share in DRAM, over four points of share in NAND. We've gained – we expanded our TAM or SAM in display probably 50%, and we've expanded our service SAM and revenues in service quite a bit. If we hadn't done those things, you wouldn't be talking about gross margins being down two points. You'd be talking about over $1 billion less of revenues probably this year. And even the revenues, if you don't like the gross margins, those are probably incremental operating margins of 30% or so. You'd be talking about a $300 million hole in profit. So we're spectacularly unhappy with our gross margins. I don't disagree. But it could have been a lot worse if we hadn't penetrated these markets, gained share, and got some new products out there. You would have had a sustainable problem of $300 million of profit a year, frankly. And if you look at the etch business, for instance, where we don't like the gross margins, believe it or not, the one business where operating margin delta from 2012 to today is greatest is probably etch because we've scaled up so much volume at pretty good operating margins. So we're spectacularly unhappy with the gross margins, but if we hadn't gotten this stuff out and repositioned the stuff, it would be an even worse call today.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you very much.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That's my answer.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: All right, Patrick, thank you for your question. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of the call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. In our second quarter of fiscal 2015, Applied delivered our highest quarterly revenue in the past three years and earnings near the top of our guidance range. These results reflect robust customer investment in both semiconductor and display, and most significantly that Applied is delivering the enabling products and services our customers need as they transition complex new devices into volume production. The magnitude of the technology change facing our customers is unprecedented, and this creates incredible opportunities for Applied Materials now and in the future. Our core competencies and unmatched talent in materials engineering provide a great platform for profitable growth. Applied has a compelling strategy. We are investing in that strategy and making meaningful progress towards our goals. The traction we are demonstrating is made possible by our employees' relentless focus on moving the company forward and their tremendous passion to create value for customers and investors. Over the past few years, we have been driving significant changes across the company, strengthening our capabilities and processes while aligning the organization to take advantage of our vast opportunities. We have aggressively shifted spending within the company to better support our customers, provide additional fuel for product development, and improve our financial performance. By increasing investment in key areas, we have created a pipeline of differentiated products that will accelerate Applied's growth, and we are already seeing a positive impact. Starting with semiconductor equipment business, the trend is clear. We are winning market share. Over the past two years, we have increased our overall share in wafer fab equipment around 1.5 points. And, based on our current view of customer spending, we expect to build on those gains this year. Our traditional leadership businesses, where we have high share, remain strong. And in 2014 we added around three points of share in both PVD and epi. We have our strongest momentum in areas of the market that represent large growth opportunities for us. Our combined revenues in CVD and etch were up over 50% year over year, significantly outgrowing the market. This past year we gained two points of share in CVD, and we have highly differentiated products in our pipeline that will expand our addressable market. We are very excited about how our new products are positioned, and we'll provide more details about our progress at our analyst meeting in July. Since 2012, we gained seven points of market share in etch, including 12 points in conductor etch. In the past two quarters, the installed base for our latest generation etch system has grown from 10 chambers to more than 160. This is one of the fastest adoption rates for any new Applied product, and customers are telling us they see technical advantages in uniformity and defect performance. We believe our technical position is getting stronger, and this provides a foundation for future share gains. We are also driving growth in our service business, where we delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue, and we're on track for a record year. At both the leading and trailing edge, our customers face incredible challenges as they strive to bring new innovations to market faster and more efficiently. By helping our customers solve their device performance, yield, and cost challenges, we believe that service can be a meaningful component of our long-term growth. We have adapted our strategy, strengthened our team, and are bringing together capabilities from across the company to deliver expanded service offerings that provide more value for our customers. Service and spare parts revenues have grown more than 17% from this time last year. During this period, we have significantly increased the number of tools under service contract, which we believe is one indicator of our growth potential. Turning to display, we expect 2015 to be a third consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth, and to increase our overall share by about two points. As we've highlighted before, our revenue and margin profiles in this business can be uneven. While we see some margin headwinds in 2016 due to customer mix and a weak yen, overall market trends remain positive. As the display industry introduces new technologies, customers' manufacturing processes are becoming more complex and capital intensive. We have invested in a strong portfolio of products aimed at enabling next-generation TVs and mobile displays. One example of this is organic LED, which expands our served available market. We recently received a large order for our OLED encapsulation tool, and in 2015 we expect to book about $200 million in this new application. Overall, our growth trajectory in semi and display is supported by a sustained period of industry investments in both capacity and technology. Even after recent customer announcements have been taken into account, we still believe 2015 wafer fab equipment investment will be up slightly over 2014, driven by increased memory spending. Sustained NAND bit growth in the 35% to 40% range, similar to 2014, enables these customers to maintain their investment levels. We expect 3D NAND to represent more than 40% of NAND investment in calendar 2015, and installed capacity should exceed 120,000 wafer starts per month by year end, which is only around 10% of total NAND capacity. This inflection not only increases our available market, but is also enabling us to gain share. Based on the positions we have won, we believe that in the transition from planar to 3D NAND, we will increase our served market share by at least five points at these customers. In DRAM, supply and demand remain well balanced, and we anticipate bit growth of 25% to 30%. We are expecting this to translate to an increase in customer spending of 15% to 25% relative to 2014. These investments are primarily focused on 20-nanometer upgrades for mobile DRAM with some capacity additions. In foundry, the leaders are engaged in a fierce battle to ramp FinFET technology at the right yield and cost. The intense pressure for our customers to accelerate volume production of their FinFET devices is a major area of focus for Applied and creates a great growth opportunity over the next few years. In summary, our customers are making incredible advances in technology, enabled by materials innovation, and this plays directly to Applied's strengths. Across the company, we are making meaningful progress towards our growth goals and driving opportunities to accelerate our strategy. Going forward, we are prioritizing three areas to further improve execution. First, we feel very positive about our new product pipeline and our ability to drive growth at Applied. In the near term, as we ramp these new products, we see some effects on our margins, particularly in cases where rapid adoption has exceeded our expectations. Bringing margin performance back in line with our financial model is a major companywide focus. Second, we will continue to actively manage our product portfolio to ensure we are deploying our investments and resources towards our most promising growth opportunities. In the past two weeks, based on our view of future market potential, we have taken actions to further lower the breakeven level of our solar business. And third, we are taking additional steps to optimize our structure, making sure that the organization is aligned to major areas of value creation for our customers and that we have the right talent in the right areas. Now let me hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional detail about these priority areas and our financial performance.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Gary. I'll add my comments about how we're doing in the transition underway at Applied Materials. Gary talked about how we've moved money from headquarter functions and underperforming businesses to higher-growth opportunities, notably in etch, CVD, display, and AGS. We've also strengthened the linkages between SSG and AGS for growth. SSG plus AGS revenue grew 20% in FY 2014, and we expect both businesses to outpace WFE in 2015. Focusing on the total life cycle of our products will increase both our revenue and profit growth. When excluding EES, Applied's trailing four-quarter revenue was the highest in seven years. Now let's look at profitability. You'll recall that our non-GAAP gross margin was 40.9% in 2012, grew to 42.1% in 2013, and reached 44.1% in 2014, or 43.6% when excluding non-run rate items. Our progress is trending ahead of plan. This year, we've faced some headwinds due to mix and the higher initial cost of fast ramping new products. In Q1, our non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%. And in Q2, it increased to 43.2%, which was nearly a point better than our forecast. We expect gross margin to be flat to up a little in Q3. Looking ahead to FY 2016, gross margin remains a key challenge to financial model performance. Within SSG, if we have similar demand in new product ramp patterns, we could experience gross margin headwinds in the first half. In display, Gary mentioned some of the margin challenges associated with the strong mobile ramp along with yen-based competition. However, leaders throughout the company are intensely focused on gross margin improvement. Based on our gross margin initiatives, we believe we can achieve year-over-year improvement in fiscal year 2016, but we expect it to be below model performance for the year. We are equally focused on managing our operating expenses. Quarterly non-GAAP OpEx should be around $575 million through the end of this year. We have a number of new products to launch which require additional support, but we will stay focused on our cost structures and continue to optimize our portfolio investments. Last week, we further reduced our solar spending and we will continue to monitor the market closely. Looking to our overall model, we continue to believe that non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 is the right level of profitability for the company when WFE spending is at $33.5 billion. With the merger pending, we were unable to take certain actions, including share repurchases. Next week, we'll begin to buy back stock under our three-year, $3 billion repurchase authorization. We plan to be opportunistic, and we could execute the program in under two years. As the buyback and other initiatives take hold, we believe that we are on a path to $1.70 in 2017, assuming WFE demand of $33.5 billion. We'll share our detailed model with you at the analyst meeting in July. Now I'll summarize our second-quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.5 billion were up 11%, led by SSG. Net sales of $2.4 billion were up 4%, which was above our expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin was 43.2%, which was better than expected due to a favorable customer mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $579 million, in line with guidance. Non-GAAP EPS at $0.29 was $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash and investments, and about $2.8 billion of this was offshore. In SSG, orders of $1.7 billion were at a three-year high and were up 19% on increases in foundry and NAND. SSG net sales of $1.6 billion were up 8%, at the high end of our expectations. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin grew by almost three points to 26.8%, driven by higher volume and a favorable product mix. AGS orders of $641 million were down 7% sequentially due to a seasonal decline in service contract renewals. AGS orders were up 19% from the second quarter of 2014. AGS achieved record net sales of $646 million. The 11% increase was driven by growth in spares and services along with 200-millimeter equipment. AGS non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3%. Display orders increased slightly to $120 million and net sales declined to $163 million, as expected. Display non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 24.5% on lower volume. EES orders were $50 million and net sales grew to $73 million, as expected. EES posted a non-GAAP operating loss of $4 million. Now I will provide our third quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be up 2% to 6% sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be up 3% to 8% sequentially. AGS net sales should be up 2% to 7%. We expect display net sales to be approximately flat, and EES net sales should be approximately $50 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35, which would be up 18% year over year at the midpoint. Now let me turn the call back over to Mike for questions.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Kyle, let's please begin.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, Bob, first question is on the margins. If I think about what's going to be necessary to get you back in line with the target model, of the three, mix, scale, or lower component costs, how would you rank order those drivers in terms of the importance of getting your margin model back to where you want it to be?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'd say in the short to intermediate term, which is the next year and a half maybe, mix hurts us the most quarter to quarter. In terms of the second one, probably margin cost because most of our component costs, most of our product costs is materials. And then the third one is the scale issue, which is overhead absorption. Now longer term, if you can make progress on that. Those are time sequenced also.
James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. And then if I could follow up, Gary, on the 3D NAND ramp, it really seems like that's gaining some incremental traction in the back half of this year. What is it that's finally making customers feel more comfortable to ramp to 3D NAND? Is it that yields are where they need to be? Is it that the opportunity in enterprise solid-state drives is bigger? Is it just the customers trying to make sure one doesn't get too far ahead of the other? What's really – why are we starting to see this inflection because it's been a while in the making? Thank you.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good question, Jim. The yield was certainly a big challenge. This is the biggest change in memory technology in decades, going from planar scaling to 3D. So that was a big, big challenge. All of the customers were focused on making the transition, as we had discussed before, but the yield is getting to the point where more volume is going towards 3D NAND. All the customers have been focused with heavy technology investments in that area, but more customers now are moving to that technology and to manufacturing, so that certainly is a big transition. And what we said for Applied Materials is that the transition from planar to 3D NAND is really good for our business because planar is more litho-intensive and 3D NAND is more in the sweet spot of materials engineering types of technologies, etch, deposition. We have additional epi steps there. So we talked about the opportunity for us on an equivalent wafer start basis going up 35% to 50%. And what we're seeing, we are very optimistic more towards the top end of that range relative to the opportunity for us in growth. And the other aspect is not only is the TAM increasing, but we believe that we will increase, as I talked about in the script, our share of that TAM. So that's another incremental growth driver for us within Applied. So we see the 3D NAND ramping certainly in 2015, and then really the majority of spending in NAND beyond 2015 is really towards 3D NAND. We also said that the capacity for 3D NAND is really 10% of total NAND capacity by the end of this year. So there's still opportunity as customers make that transition and really good tailwinds for us in terms of TAM and market share.
James Vincent Covello - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's really helpful. Thank you so much, good luck.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, can you walk through your latest thoughts on linearity first half/second half in terms of you and industry shipments?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. We think the second half is a little stronger than the first half. And we think particularly, we think foundry is up second half versus first half. I'm doing revenues. DRAM is a little softer. NAND is stronger, and logic is about neutral.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities: That's very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, as you look at the handoff from DRAM to NAND going first half to second half, can you walk through what your intensity looks like in one sector versus the other, and also how we should think about the implications to gross margins? Thank you.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: If you look at it historically, in the last year or so our share in DRAM versus NAND overall is comparable. If you go look at the transition though at NAND, as Gary said earlier, growth in 3D for a company like Applied, we said 35% to 50% increase in the greenfield; it's probably a little more even. And if you look at our share gains, they're about five points in that transition, so we gained five points of that TAM. So the transition from DRAM to NAND – 2D NAND is somewhat better for us. The transition to 3D is substantively better for us.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So the other thing I would say is that we're gaining share in memory in both NAND and DRAM. Last quarter, what we had discussed was we had our highest DRAM orders since 2010. We actually exceeded that this quarter. So for the last two quarters, the DRAM business for us is up significantly, and we are gaining share in both of those different areas.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, a couple things. I guess, Bob, first a question on OpEx. Did I hear you say that OpEx will be down $35 million quarter on quarter between April to July?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, I said it would be about $575 million.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: $575 million, okay, all right. Then I guess to follow on to that, if you look at that element relative to your financial model, that seems to be the area where, given where your revenue is, that's the line item that is the most out of whack. So either you have to grow revenue without growing OpEx or you have to cut OpEx to bring that in line to where revenue is. So can you just talk about that? Can you talk about which of those two you think is more likely? Thanks.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, the model was a 2016 model, so we actually see revenues growing next year. We think this year is probably a little under a $33 billion year for WFE. Next year the model is at $33.5 billion, so WFE is a little better in that model. Second, we think our share will be up in WFE this year and next somewhat. And then we think AGS is showing good growth momentum. And display should be pretty good in revenues next year. So we think the revenues could be an uptick and approach the model next year. In terms of the biggest discrepancy, in my opinion, frankly, is a little bit of gross margins. 44.5% was the model. If you look at the document, it said 45%, but the math is 44.5%. We're up to 44.1% in fiscal 2014. The quarter just ended, we were at 43.2%. We go up a little bit maybe the second half, but in the first half if etch is heavy and there are a little bit of display mix problems, we're not up. So I'd say the biggest delta is probably the gross margin line. If you look at expenses, we're at $575 million. If we hold at that line, which is what we're saying, then we'll be at $2.3 billion. The model is $2.2 billion to $2.8 billion, so we're $72 million over. But a lot of that's related to all the new products coming out. I think the biggest discrepancy is probably the gross margin line, personally.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tim.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, Bob. Thanks much. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. My first question is regarding the backlog. I saw that there were some debookings in the quarter. Can you talk about what those were? And was some of the impact from the recent cuts that we have seen from TSMC and Intel?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure. The backlog, there were some debookings of stuff that either slipped out of the quarter or turned around. There was cats and dogs in there too, frankly. There was a little bit of foundry, some of the miscellaneous. Foreign exchange was $10 million of that, so that was just FX. So I wouldn't draw too many conclusions on it.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it, and then another long-term question, just talking about the balance sheet structure. Have you given any thought to what level of debt you need or you can support on the balance sheet and try to recapitalize your balance sheet and return some cash to shareholders?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We've given a lot of thought to everything, especially the last few weeks, in looking at the $3 billion. We think – I'm actually pretty optimistic we can get the $3 billion done in less than two years. I'm actually reasonably optimistic that we can continue a significant buyback for a number of years without going into heavy debt. I think we'll go into moderate debt, but I'm actually getting optimistic on the tax and the cash flow. And then if we need to take on some debt to continue significant share returns to investors, we're willing to look at that too, and we plan to do some of that too. But I'm actually getting more optimistic on the foreign cash lately.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you, that's all I have.
Operator: Your next questions comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question, two of them, first one for either Bob or Gary. As you look ahead and focus on both trying to gain share and renewed focus on gross margin, I'm curious. Is there going to be a difference in the pricing philosophy for the company? Are you going to look at pricing differently, be more rational, or is it going to be status quo? I'm just curious on that, and I also had a follow-up after that.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So let me talk a little bit about the model. Tim had asked this question earlier. In semi, we're very optimistic. We talked about the growth in our business as these new memory technologies are ramping into production. And certainly in FinFET first generation, 10-nanometer, that's a great opportunity for us with the products we have enabling those transitions. We gained 1.5 points over the last two years. We indicated we believe we'll gain share again this year. And as these transitions ramp, we're still in the early innings in terms of some of these transitions in the semiconductor area. So we're optimistic in that area. Display, I talked earlier today about three years of double-digit gains in revenue in the display market. Again, there are major technology transitions there. We talked about a new area where that generated $200 million in revenue – will generate $200 million in revenue this year. So again, we have some good growth opportunities in display. And service, our service and spares was up 17% in our service and spares from last year, record revenue. So we have really good growth opportunities. So when you look at the model, the top line revenue growth, if you look at where we were when we published that model to where we think we'll be, we're going to be in the range of that number for top line revenue growth, which was an incredible accomplishment versus what we said we would do. We still believe these opportunities are great opportunities for us. One of the things I also talked about was in etch, we went with a – we're introducing a new chamber that customers are telling us technically has advantages in uniformity and defect performance. But as you're ramping these many new areas simultaneously, we have great, great new products that are targeted at these inflections. There's going to be some margin pressure with startup in some of these areas, and frankly they're going even faster than we had expected due to the pull from the customers. The key thing in any business is to have value, technical value, and differentiation you're delivering to our customers. So our focus is to enable these inflections for our customers in semiconductor and display. And in that process, we will drive market share higher, and hopefully the value for the customer with these differentiated products will also go up over time. As Bob had said earlier, in 2016, due to mix, we believe that the margins are going to be behind. But we are still driving to achieve those margin goals. The timing may be a little bit later than what we had talked about, but the momentum for the company relative to revenue growth is in the range of what we discussed when we published the model. And again, the margins are going to be off, as Bob talked about. But we are driving. There are a number of opportunities for us to drive, to close and exceed that gap from a gross margin standpoint.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it, guys. And then just as a follow-up along the same path, if I look at SSG products, the one that has the biggest potential for share gain is conductor etch, but that also looks like it has probably one of the lower gross margins. Will the conductor etch product, do you think, get to the same level as some of your other dominant products like PVD, or do you think that it's going to be structurally a lower gross margin product division?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Over time, we see a lot of opportunity for us to drive higher margins in that business. Certainly, the share gains over the last couple years have been pretty significant. Our business went from I think 2012, from $350 million to about $1 billion last year, so just dramatic gains in the etch business. We think over time there's still a lot of upside potential. And it really, as I said, comes back to how are you technically positioned in the markets. And there are some significant advantages that customers are seeing. It's in the early innings of that being validated with customers. But you really look for architectural advantages in your products where you can solve high-value problems for customers in these inflections. We believe there are those areas that we can drive over time, and certainly a lot of opportunity for us to improve our margins in that area.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks, Gary.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Krish.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking my question and good job on the results. Gary, if I look at the foundry spending at one of your customers that cut their CapEx, if I look at the CapEx and divide it by the capacity, the CapEx per year at capacity is flat over last year, and that's partly because the 20-nanometer demand wasn't strong and they were re-using more equipment. So my question is it if I look at 10-nanometer, how should we think about that ratio of CapEx to capacity as you move to 10-nanometer for the equipment makers?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So 10-nanometer is – we'll talk more about this at SEMICON. I've heard some customers say that this is the most important node in the history of their company. So you look really at where the pull is from an end user perspective in terms of mobile devices. Certainly there is a lot of value. People are trying to pack more performance, more features, and drive lower power for those devices. So 10-nanometer is a big battle for all of the different companies, and there is tremendous focus there, and the engagement with the customers are very deep and very broad. When we look at the opportunity for the CapEx, if you take equivalent number of wafer starts, it goes up a significant amount versus what we're looking at for the 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer node. We'll talk more about this at SEMICON. But it is a great opportunity, and there is a significant change in that device as the customers are ramping 10-nanometer, and we look at that being a great opportunity for us. In the transistor area, we have more epi steps, real strength in PVD, implant, a number of different areas, and then also the interconnect structures there will also change. So this, as we've said many times, is the sweet spot relative to materials engineering. And we look at 10-nanometer being a really, really great opportunity to drive our business over the next few years. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything else on that one.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Maybe I could, if you don't mind. If you want to look at some of this capital intensity and reuse and nodal transitions, you have to look at three things really. One is, what's the relative capital intensity of the node? Two, where are they in the transition to a node? And three, how big is the node? So what is worrisome to some people right now is gee, they're getting a lot of reuse, and is that not as good for you on capital intensity? I'm not actually too worried. If you look at the data, we think this year is probably a $33 billion year. And if you adjust for foreign exchange with the weaker yen and weaker euro, it's probably north of $33.5 billion. So the year is pretty good. Now look at what they're spending on. For three years in a row, 2012 to 2013, 2013 to 2014, and 2014 to 2015, the percentage of the spending that is going to companies like Applied, actually Applied, has gone up as a percentage of 100%. So this PME thing is really taking traction. Third, if you look at where they are in the nodal transition, 16-nanometer to 14-nanometer they're pretty early. 20-nanometer wasn't a big node and they're doing some reuse. But if you look at it as they get later into the node, the percent of reuse probably goes down somewhat. And two, as Gary said, 10-nanometer is a big node. And if you look at the capital intensity, which we'll talk to you more about at Analyst Day, it looks like 10-nanometer mix again plays for companies like us. So I'm actually not too upset about the nodal transition or the mix for us.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, that's very helpful. And as a follow-up, Bob or Gary, your services growth is outstanding if I compare it to the wafer start growth, which is about 3% to 4% year over year. Can you provide us a percentage of your install base that's currently under contract so we can see how much headroom you have?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: What I would say on the service contracts is that we are making really significant progress relative to service contracts. And all of those tools under contract really provide a great forward momentum for us in the service business. We've made a lot of changes relative to our strategy, our structure, bringing new talent into the organization, and also the connection between the service business and the semiconductor business units. We've relocated people. It's really stronger than ever in terms of those value roadmaps for customers. So that's translating into significant growth in our service and spares business, which I talked about earlier was 17% growth in service and spares year over year. And we believe there is a huge opportunity. If you look at the share, it's still very, very, very low. We have a lot of momentum there, and we think the growth opportunity there for us is significant.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Let me add something, connect the dots with a question that was asked earlier. The point question that was asked earlier is, can etch gross margins get to be where some of your higher product gross margins are? I think the answer is they can certainly improve from where they are. But even if you look at other etch companies in our industry, the overall etch gross margin is not as high as some of our other high gross margin business, higher-share businesses. But what is very attractive about etch is a few things. One, if you look at our growth in operating profits since 2012 in etch, it's outstanding in terms of what's dropped through to the bottom line. It's very good. Second thing is, if you look at etch in the aftermarket, and we're focused more and more at the total product lifecycle profitability of a business, etch is probably the biggest opportunity because these tools, as Gary said, many times eat themselves. So in terms of driving long term profitability and predictable profitability, etch is a very attractive business.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon and nice job on the quarterly execution, guys. As a follow-up to the previous question on 10-nanometer, it sounds like another solid move up in intensity for the Applied team. We've heard pilot production later this year to first half of next year. The question is, are you guys seeing the 10-nanometer spending in your order pipeline for this quarter, the July quarter, or is it more targeted to come into your order pipeline more in the second half of this year?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's really not amounting to a large number right now. And certainly the engagements that we have with the customers is really better than ever across all of our different products, certainly in the transistor area with epi, PVD, more epi steps. That's a great opportunity for us. And in the patterning space, one of the things that we did in the organization is pull all of the patterning groups together. So we have etch, the selected material removals, CVD, ALD. And the synergies there for us as we are delivering these new materials, our ability to deliver those materials and etch them and remove them, that's a great synergy that we're driving as part of the organization change that we made. So the opportunity for us there, the engagements we have are great leading indicators of where we're going to be when that ramps, and they're broader and deeper than we've ever had. But from a revenue standpoint right now, it's not a significant number for us. It's a very small number for us.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it, okay. I was talking more about orders there. But I understand where you're going with that. And then on the NAND segment, obviously very strong orders, up I think 40% sequentially. How much of this order mix in the April quarter was 3D, or is it still being focused on planar? And I'm assuming that the 3D spending mix is moving higher here in the July quarter. Are you seeing this order trajectory spread across multiple customers?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: On NAND in total, we had a good bookings quarter, as you said, and we think it's pretty strong for the rest of the year, as we told you earlier. The second thing we told you earlier was by the end of the year we see 120,000 wafer starts installed, which is about 10% of overall capacity, up from about 60,000 last year at the end of last year. So we see a heavier weighting of the 3D in the second half spending.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Harlan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Hi, Gary and Bob, just a follow-up question on the gross margin next year. So is the gross margin issue mostly because of the display margin headwinds and less from these new etchers? And what is the display margin issue? Is it mostly from this new OLED display win that you're just ramping for the first time?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: If you go look at it – I'm looking at the data actually so I can be more accurate. So if you look at it, we're a little more where we want to be. We'll be up next year, we believe, in SSG in absolute gross margin percentages, but not as far up as we want. Now the reason we're not getting as far as we want is mostly mix. The reason we're improving in absolute dollars is within each product we're doing better. But the mix is still a little bit off, particularly in the first half. Within display, again, it's a mix thing that next year, our business predominantly for many years has been driven by TV equipment. So we sell equipment to make TV panels or TV screens. Next year is a disproportionate number of sales of very high, I think the highest ever, and probably the highest we will have for the foreseeable future sales of smaller screen sizes, which is a somewhat different mix of tools, somewhat different mix of customers. So that's just for cell phones mostly. And so that's the mix that's hurting us in display next year, and it's unprecedented in the volume.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, thanks for sharing that. And my follow-up question is just a general question on multiple patterning. There seems to be a perception that once EUV tools are put into production, there will be a big decline in some of these etching deposition sales for multiple patterning. I was just hoping you could share your thoughts on this given the big EUV order that we saw recently. Thanks.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Stephen. I think our position on EUV is consistent with what we've said in the past. We think it's post-10-nanometer when you would start seeing any real volume on EUV. And so as we said, over the next few years, the real big driver for us will be the 10-nanometer node and maybe the second generation of the 10-nanometer node. That we anticipate to be a big node, a real important competitive battle for our customers. And we'll talk more about this at SEMICON, but really a great driver for us from a TAM standpoint. EUV is out beyond that timeframe, so it's out beyond the next few years. And then the other aspect is when EUV comes in, we believe that we'll also come in potentially with multiple patternings. So the timeframe for EUV to the really have any impact on our business is out there several years, so we don't see anything really near term. And certainly again the big, big, big driver for us over the next, I would say, two to three years is going to be the 10-nanometer node and maybe the shrink of that node.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thanks, Gary.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Gary, you've mentioned that revenue growth in this industry is hard to come by. And given that and the developments over the last couple of weeks, why can't you guys do better than the OpEx run rate of $2.3 billion?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not sure I completely understand the question. The revenue growth, as I talked about earlier, we have a lot of momentum around these inflections in semiconductor and display. And in semi, we gained 1.5 points over the last couple of years. We expect that we will gain share again this year. And as these new technologies ramp, we're still in the early innings in terms of the change in memory technology and the whole FinFET battle that is happening with our customers. So we're very optimistic based on the investments we've made and our teams that we will continue our momentum in growing our share of WFE in the semiconductor business through those transitions. As I said earlier, in display, three years of double-digit revenue gains in the display business, so we have very good opportunities there. And also in display, that market is undergoing significant changes from a technology standpoint, including this new area in OLED that we're ramping. So again, we have a lot of confidence in the growth longer term in our display business, a great team. They're gaining share, and also we're expanding our TAM with these new applications. So that part we're very, very, very happy with the progress that we're making in all of the major parts of our business. The OpEx question relative to the $575 million number where we're at right now, our number one focus is that we want to capture these inflections with our products, in semiconductor and display, and continue to grow the service business. And as I said earlier, we're pretty much on track for significant top line growth. If you looked at where we were at when we talked about the model versus the momentum that we have, we're in the range of what we talked about earlier for top line revenue growth. So as you said, it's really hard, but I am very proud of this team that we have at Applied and what we've been able to accomplish and the momentum that we have in these different businesses. We will continue to look for opportunities to optimize the business. We moved hundreds of millions of dollars over the last couple of years into areas that will drive longer-term shareholder value. Bob talked about the action that we are taking in the solar business right now. There are probably more opportunities for us to continue to optimize the portfolio. And longer term, we will continue to look at structural changes that will lower our overall spending in the company and improve productivity. But in the next year, we are very, very focused on top line revenue growth. And as you said, that's very, very difficult to come by.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you for that. And one of the things you highlighted in your monologue was just the strength of the services business. And if I look at that as a percentage of SSG, it's around 41% attach rate. Is that the right way to think about it, services as a percentage of SSG? And is that 41% a number that you think you can improve on?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So again, the 17% growth in service and spares in the last year, so think about the service business around $2.5 billion. This year will be north of $2.5 billion. And I think in the model, we had something like $2.6 billion – $2.7 billion for...
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No, the original model was only $2.561 billion.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: $2.561 billion. So anyway...
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We beat it.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we'll beat that. But if you can achieve double-digit revenue growth in service, as we are this year, that's $250 million – $300 million. That's almost 1% of WFE. So through a lot of changes in our strategy, our structure, we are increasing our service and spares business. We're adding value to the products. So that can be a great revenue driver as we're adding more value for our customers. So certainly, that's an area that the whole company is focused on is really creating more value for customers and then driving growth in that area.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Romit.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Gary, first, in terms of the share gains you've garnered on the memory space, can you give a little more color on the gains that you've achieved on the foundry space, where you've traditionally have had strong exposure in many of your process segments? Can you give a little bit of color where you see some of the gains?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Are you talking about in foundry, Patrick?
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In the last year, certainly PVD and epi, we talked about both of those areas being up 3%, and those are great growth drivers for us. All of the different areas around the transistor, if you look at our implant business, for instance, that business is very, very, very strong. The switching cost in the memory is much higher than in any other market. So that area, our high current share in foundry...
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: In foundry?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Our high current share in foundry is in the 90% range. So that area is extremely strong. Last quarter we said that our etch business had the highest revenue in foundry since 2007, so we are making some progress there. We are making more significant progress certainly in V-NAND and the memory space, but that's an area that we think longer term is a really, really great opportunity for us. So there are a number of areas. I don't know, Bob, if you want to add anything on this one. There are a number of different areas, and I think as you go to the future nodes in FinFET, our TAM opportunity will increase a significant amount around transistor, interconnect, and a number of different areas.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I think the three things you look at here is how big is your product footprint in foundry and how strong is it? And two and three are you getting D2R wins? So if you go look at – our foundry footprint is very strong and they're highly differentiated products. That's why it stays strong. It's a share position. In terms of gaining share, because they run so many different devices and so many different customers and they're so complex, turning D2Rs into P2Rs takes a little longer, but we've got some pretty damn good D2R positions that we've worked on the last two years, which very well could turned into P2Rs later this year.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The other thing I would say, in our PDC area, we're stronger in foundry and logic, and this last quarter we had some good wins in a couple of major foundries. One of the things also, if you look at our 2015 business in PDC, it's about 60% E-Beam and 40% optical. And in E-Beam, we have very high share in the E-Beam review area with the SEMVision. And if you look at the different areas of the segments within E-Beam, CD SEM, E-Beam inspection, and defect review, those are all areas that are growing very fast. And our technology there, especially electron optics imaging capability, is really world class. So that's another area we look at as we go forward where we see a potential for growth.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, that's helpful, and maybe, Bob, a specific question for you in terms of the margin impacts on some of these new product ramps. Obviously, you mentioned that the faster than expected traction has obviously put some pressure on the near term. When do you expect to see some of those supply chain efficiencies kick in, in terms of I guess supply agreements and volume buys that will help margins improve over time?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: What we're doing, Patrick, is what's driving us down is mix, where we're gaining some share a little faster than we probably expected and the new products are starting to track in. Now what we're doing to mitigate that is get the new products up the gross margin curve faster and also to get gross margins up everywhere else across the company, and that's through material cost absorption. So the cost reduction efforts across the whole company in terms of PPV are picking up reasonably, not heroically yet. We're getting better. In terms of the new products, it's picking up faster. So my guess is you'll start to see – you're seeing progress now. It will pick up more next year. What's killing us in the first half of next year is mix again.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question, first a clarification. Did I hear correctly that earlier, Bob, you said you expected 2016 WFE market to be $33.5 billion, or are you just referring to your operating models that you talked to in the past?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We don't have an official forecast. That's our model. We don't have any detailed analysis of that. If you ask and take me out for a beer, it's a working model that's okay to work with, but we don't have a real number yet.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. My first question then is, on the DRAM side, obviously very strong bookings in the first two quarters and record level last quarter. And you've talked about the second half DRAM revenue will be lower than the first half. I know you're not giving 2016 guidance yet, but are there any reasons why this strength will not continue in 2016 given the increased complexity and multiple patterning steps used in advanced nodes?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: In terms of DRAM, you said?
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Correct.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'll tell you my guess. I don't know if you've got it here, but I'll tell you my guess. I think the V-NAND thing is going to pick up momentum because I think you're going to see more and more go to 3D. Patterning doesn't play there. So in fact, if you look at the mix of etch and deposition, it plays particularly well for us. If you go to DRAM, patterning does play an increasing role there. I agree with that. Now if you look at DRAM, prices are down a little bit, so they're very driven by economics in that business. So the cost is getting a little higher to make those devices, so the patterning is positive for them, but the cost is an issue in the pricing. So I think that DRAM capacity adds will be moderate.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And my follow-up question is, now that the deal is over and the reason being future product roadmap, can you talk about what areas within etch and deposition that you are not currently strong in but you are expecting to gain share in the future?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The DOJ certainly was confident, I'll tell you that.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think as we've talked about last year, we had just tremendous momentum in etch and CVD with 50% revenue growth, and we really are optimistic about the momentum we have in both of those different areas. And so we continue to believe that the opportunity for us for share gains and growing those businesses is very good. Another area that we see as a great opportunity is ALD. We've been investing in new technology there. And we believe that that has potential for significant future growth. We have very strong pull from customers for this new technology that we've developed, but we're not in a position really to give any more color at this time. But that's certainly another area on top of the momentum that we have in etch and CVD where we see a great opportunity.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller from CLSA. Your line is open.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Gary, I didn't quite catch it. But the display mix in I guess fiscal 2016, did you say if that's LCD or OLED related?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The 2016 mix is – I'll start at the higher level. Most of it's weighted towards smaller feature sizes. That would be the cell phones versus TVs. And when you look within it, most of those are all OLED, and it's particularly LTPS, a lot of it.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The mix, as Bob talked about, the mobility mix versus TV is really up about – the percentage of the mobility is up about 2x if you look year to year, and then it goes back down to a more normalized mix between the two different markets for us. So that particular year, we see the mix of mobility up a significant amount, double what it was the year before, and we think the year after it will go back down to this more normalized mix that we've seen for a number of years.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Okay, got it. And then going back to this WFE question, I remember in 2013 you gave the financial model before the TEL deal was announced, talking about WFE may be as high as $37 billion. I know you're not giving an official forecast for next year. But is there something that's tempering how high WFE can go in a given year? Has something changed there?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'll give you my observations. When we put the model out in July 2013, one of the biggest reasons for that number was that was Dataquest's number basically at that time. We didn't know 2017 – 2016 rather. And then we put up three numbers at that time, $30 billion, $33.5 billion and $37 billion. And a fair amount of our focus was on the $33.5 billion. In terms of what next year will be, we really haven't spent much time. I think it's a pretty healthy year. Could be north of that. I honestly don't know. I don't even know what Dataquest says. Do we know what Dataquest says for next year? It's up a little more than that. I think Dataquest is maybe $34 billion or something.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think certainly what we can see relative to our business, if you look at what's going to happen over the next two or three years, this transition in 3D NAND, as we said, by the end of this year you only have 10% of the capacity with 3D NAND. So that transition is really a good one for us, and the 10-nanometer transition we believe is a great opportunity. So those are going to be some of the major drivers for us over the next two or three years. And then we try to size the business relative to a normal run rate on WFE. And certainly there could be drivers to make it higher than that. But from a planning standpoint, we're sizing it around the $33 billion to $33.5 billion level.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes, thank you. I just want to – I have a follow-up question on 3D NAND. Right now you have a couple of customers adding capacity for production and the use are probably not at the highest level. And they're working – different customers are working on different structures. My question is at the maturity on 3D NAND, 48-layer TLC, what bit density do you get on the wafer compared to planar? Are they closer to getting three-to-one, or are they far behind that?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I'll do it from memory. I don't have this in front of me, Mahesh. Our take on it was the initial transition from planar to 3D, they got traditional type of bit growth that they get in a planar shrink. They get the bigger capital efficiency and bit growth going from first generation to second generation 3D. Now what we used to run in models was a lot of 32-bit to 64-bit. So 32-bit to 64-bit, you get over 100% because you get the scaling and also the size. I don't even know if it shrinks at 40-nanometer – 50-nanometer stuff. So I think the big opportunity for them is 64-bit. 48-bit is a midway I'd say. So I'd say it's moderate. It's better than first generation, not as good as 64-bit.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then on your WFE number, I suppose the last quarter you had a little bit higher number than now, and of course a lot of changes has happened since last quarter. Can you articulate what you have seen changes in segment-wise from last quarter to this quarter in terms of DRAM flash and logic and foundry?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We haven't actually changed a lot. We were about a $33.5 billion last quarter. Kind of about $33 billion now. Some of that's just FX as you run it through the euro on WFE. The euro doesn't affect us much, but euro and yen. So then the second thing is there have been some announcements like TSMC seems a little less. But I'm actually feel like maybe NAND is a little stronger later in the year. So net-net, I'm neutral on the year. In terms of how we feel specifically by space, we're a little higher on DRAM now than we were last quarter, a little higher on NAND than we were last quarter. We're a little lower on foundry, and logic probably a little negative too from last quarter.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next questions comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Good afternoon. So as it pertains to growth, you talked a lot today about 3D NAND and you talked about the 10-nanometer transition. What about DRAM? Is DRAM in your mind a growth market for you in the next couple years?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes, I think so. I mean I think so. I think that if you'll look at it, what's driving it: number one, wafer starts; number two, capital intensity; number three, our position there. So if you go look at 2015, we think overall spending is up, I don't know, 15% or something like that, 15% to 25%. And if you look at our position there, it's been improving. We gained share in DRAM in the last year or two, and we think that will continue this year.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Go ahead, Gary.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think DRAM, mobile DRAM especially has been driving incremental investment, and we're happy that our share of that market is increasing. And so that is a positive driver. But you don't have the same...
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Inflections.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Yes.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...inflections in the DRAM business going forward that you have in 3D NAND and you have certainly in the FinFET technologies. The 3D NAND, the litho CapEx is declining, and the areas that we're participating in are going up a significant amount. And so we have an opportunity there with not only the CapEx increase, but more of the CapEx being spent on our area of the market, a significant change from what was there in the planar technology node. And the same thing is true on the FinFET technology. Again, that really leverages our materials engineering, some of our strongest products, as those technologies inflections are happening. So the DRAM opportunity is a good one for us, but it's not the same order of magnitude driver for us as the transition to 3D NAND and FinFET. And that's my feeling.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: I agree with you. Most of what they're doing this year is conversions versus capacity adds.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the display side, is the move of OLED to TVs, is that the sweet spot for you going forward, or do you think margins might be an issue at that point as well?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We think that OLED is more focused on mobile right now, the smaller screens for mobility types of applications, not so much on TVs.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: It's pretty expensive for TVs.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: I was thinking out the next couple of years when it does ultimately move to TVs if that is more of the sweet spot for you versus next year.
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's no question. OLED in general, we've said, if you look at it more as silicon compared to OLED, our TAM grows about 2x. So certainly as OLED is adopted, both in mobility and in the future in the TV market, that is a really great transition for us. And you really can see it also in the thin film encapsulation. We talked about the incremental opportunity there, but there are more deposition steps as you go to OLED technology. So the adoption in any of these different markets for us is a really good driver.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, thank you.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Tom. And, Kyle, we have time for just one more question, please.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. So first question in terms of just directionally maybe in the second half of the year versus first half, how do you see your booking trending between the DRAM/foundry and logic buckets?
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: We think foundry is up in the second half. We think – do you have bookings?
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes.
Robert J. Halliday - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Foundry is up. DRAM is down a little bit. NAND is up. Logic is flat.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, great. That's helpful, and then I guess a question on PDC. So we saw some of the data from Gartner they published around market share, and it seems like PDC may be down a little bit last year. Can you maybe help us with that a little bit? Is it due to mix? How do you guys see your position? And I think you talked about 10-nanometer being an opportunity and obviously it's much higher process control intensity. How do you think you're positioned there? Do you think that could drive some incremental growth there potentially starting in 2016?
Gary E. Dickerson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Again, relative to the intensity of the percent WFE, PDC – this area has not been a great driver over the last couple years. And relative to some of the other inflections that we're focused on, we don't see this as being as large an inflection in our markets as some of the other areas. But as I talked about earlier, our business is really, if we look at 2015, more heavily weighted towards E-Beam segments, where we have a lot of strength, really great technologies. That segment of the market is growing fast and we really see a great opportunity for us to leverage that strength in growing that part of the market. In the optical inspection area last year, certainly the mix of customers worked against us, but we recently had a really strong quarter relative to orders from a couple of large foundries. And we look at our technology position there as incrementally better than where we were at before. So we're optimistic overall PDC growth in 2015 will be good for us, and then really being positioned from a technical standpoint going forward in PDC where we think this can be a growth driver. I wouldn't say this is on the same scale as some of the other opportunities we have on the inflections and the 3D NAND and 10-nanometer FinFET. But certainly incrementally it's a positive for us, and the incremental profit from that business is also very good overall.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great, thanks.
Michael Sullivan - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Edwin, for your question, and we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Dustin. Today, we'll discuss the results for our first quarter, which ended on January 25. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements about Applied's performance, products, strategies, opportunities, announced business combination with Tokyo Electron and business and industry outlook. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied, and they should be interpreted in that light. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our most recent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak as of February 11, 2015, and we assume no obligation to update them. Today's call also includes non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Let me start by providing an assessment of our overall progress. First, our long-term strategy. We are driving profitable growth by enabling major technology inflections using our precision materials engineering leadership to gain share and grow faster than the markets we serve. Major transitions in semiconductor and Display technology create great opportunities for Applied. We are making meaningful progress towards our long-term strategic goals, and this will be accelerated by our upcoming merger. In the midterm, we have been focused on those opportunities that move the needle for customers and for Applied. We have strengthened our R&D and field teams, while increasing investment in product development. We've also created a pipeline of new, differentiated products that accelerate Applied's growth when customers move to new technology -- when customers move new technology into high-volume production. And we're managing the effect on margins as we ramp these new products. In the short term, the forecasted levels of invested by our -- investment by our customers provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. While there are challenges inherent in our spending mix and some uncertainties about timing, we remain firmly on our trajectory of profitable growth. At the same time, we are completing our preparations to merge with Tokyo Electron. The Applied and Tokyo Electron teams are very excited about the strategic opportunity this merger creates and share a strong commitment to work together to achieve our performance goals for the new company. We believe we are making progress with regulators around the world on a coordinated proposal that would allow us to move forward with our business combination. We are working to secure the remaining approvals and complete the merger as soon as possible. During this phase, we've been advised not to provide details or answer questions about ongoing discussions. Turning to our market outlook. Industry growth is fueled by evolving trends in mobility, connectivity, video and wearable devices. This is accelerating innovations in mobile processors, solid-state storage and interactive displays. Our customers are focused on winning share in these inflection and this is resulting in a period of sustained investment by semiconductor customers. We believe wafer fab equipment spending for calendar 2014 was approximately 15% higher than the previous year. And as we look ahead, we maintain our view that the market could grow another 5% or more in 2015. In foundry, we expect investment to be maintained at the same healthy levels seen in 2014, with the potential to be slightly higher than last year. Our current view is that spending for advanced nodes will be heavily biased towards the second half of the year. While we see some timing uncertainty with the ramp of this complex technology, the FinFET inflection is highly beneficial for Applied, expanding the opportunity for our leadership products in FE, metal deposition, implants, anneals and CMP. In memory, supply remains tight with a healthy pricing environment and robust investment. In the past quarter, we booked our highest orders from memory customers in over 7 years. This includes our highest quarterly DRAM orders since 2010. DRAM bit growth for 2015 is expected to be around 30% with mobile DRAM standing out as the most significant driver. While technology conversions are currently providing a large portion of the needed supply, increasing device complexity and additional process steps required at the smaller nodes are reducing effective factory output. In addition, mobile DRAM devices are typically larger than PC DRAM and the combination of these factors is leading to new capacity additions this year. The market for NAND memory is also expanding. Leading smartphone makers have doubled the average bits per box over the past 12 months and this, added to growth in solid-state drives is supporting NAND bit growth in the range of 40%. Although we believe the majority of NAND investments will still be focused on advanced planar capacity, we see 3D NAND spending for the year at approximately twice the 2014 level, with more customers starting to move to this technology. The industry's transition to 3D NAND has been slower than forecast, however, it remains a positive inflection for Applied, expanding our served available market by 35% to 50%. The outlook for Display also remains very healthy. Average TV sizes are growing faster than historic rates, and we are seeing a surge in unit sales, fueled by consumer spending on new 4K and OLED models. Demand for bigger, higher resolution, low-power screens for mobile applications is also a key factor behind Display growth. In TV and mobile, supply is tight, and our customers are investing in new capacity and advanced technology. This quarter, our Display business delivered its highest revenue in the past 3 years. As we have said before, major inflections like FinFET, 3D NAND and new displays represent unprecedented technology advances that are enabled by materials innovation. We are still in the early stages of these inflections and as they play out over the next several years, they create great, long-term growth opportunities for Applied. To fully capitalize on these transitions, we have aligned our structure and talent around key areas of value creation. We will continue to aggressively manage our product portfolio so we can quickly shift resources to areas that are truly enabling for customers and generate the best returns for us. We are starting to see the impact of these changes. In 2013, we won 1.4 points of share in wafer fab equipment while delivering innovative and enabling new products to customers. In 2014, we consolidated our new product positions and strengthened our product pipeline. We believe we gained share or held share in almost all our businesses. And based on our current view of customer spending, we expect to grow our overall wafer fab equipment share again in 2015. We are making our largest gains in areas where the market is growing rapidly, including CVD and Etch. This past calendar year, we estimate that we won at least 3 points of share in CVD and 5 points of share in conductor etch. Etch is a business where we continue to build momentum. We have been focusing on key technology inflections in market segments, where we believe we have sustainable technology differentiation. New wins in memory combined with our traction in foundry, helped us deliver our highest Etch quarterly revenues in orders since 2007. Our latest generation Etch system has one of the fastest adoption rates of any new Applied product in recent years. We shipped 3x as many chambers in the first quarter than we did in the prior quarter, and we expect to double shipment volumes again in Q2. We also see great opportunities to grow our service business. We are bringing together capabilities from across the company to develop expanded service offerings that help customers ramp complex new device technologies faster and at lower cost. At both leading and trailing nodes, wafer starts and fab utilization are at very high levels. We are winning new service contracts from a broad base of customers and growing faster than the market. Over the past 2 quarters, our service business booked its highest orders for any 6-month period in our history. In summary, while there are risks related to the timing of customer investments, our current view is that 2015 will be a solid market growth -- a year of solid market growth, driven by robust memory spending in the first half and foundries ramping FinFET production in the second half. Applied Materials has a strong platform to gain share, driven by tremendous customer pull for enabling precision materials, engineering products and services. And across the organization, we remain highly focused on improving execution. We are driving alignment, speed and scale as we prepare to merge with Tokyo Electron and hit the ground running as we become one company. Let me now hand the call over to Bob, who will provide further details on our performance and outlook.
Robert J. Halliday: Thanks, Gary. Gary gave us an update on the market environment and the status of technology inflections. I'll begin by translating how we expect those patterns to play out in our business during the current fiscal year. First, you'll notice that memory spending is particularly strong in the first half of our year. In Q1, our memory orders top foundry and logic orders for the first time in 5 years, and we could see a similar mix in Q2. Next, you will notice that while our foundry customers are intensely focused on ramping FinFETs, the order pattern is shaping up to the back half loaded, also for the first time in years. We expect this mix to put more revenue and margin in our fiscal second half. Gary indicated the calendar 2015 WFE could be up by 5% or more. The greatest swing factor in our model is how much of the expected foundry spending is captured by the end of our fiscal year in October. From where we sit today, we expect a very strong fiscal second half. The high mix of memory in Etch resulted in gross margins being below our expectations for the quarter. Specifically, Etch grew 90% sequentially, higher than our previous goal of 60%. Gary spoke about our focus on portfolio management. Like we discussed, some of the results we're seeing in our efforts to generate profitable growth across our businesses. In AGS, we've strengthened the linkages to SSG and operations, invested in higher-value offerings and focused on delivering long-term service contracts that could help customers with uptime, yields and cost. After 2 years of declining sales, AGS posted 9% growth in fiscal 2014. AGS delivered near-record orders in Q1 and is on track for continued revenue growth and margin expansion. Our Display business was the first one to fully deploy our product development engine best practices and received internal funding to capture share in CVD, PVD and new products based on large area precision materials engineering. In Q1, the Display group posted a second sequential quarter with operating margins above 25%. Display also had strong momentum, with new Gen 6 PVD products for advanced mobile displays and new CVD encapsulation systems for OLEDs. In FSG, the increased investments we made beginning in the second half of 2012 are starting to pay off by giving us memory share gains during a period of renewed memory investment. In calendar 2014, memory spending drove the growth of the Etch and CVD markets at a higher rate than overall WFE. We believe Applied's Etch and CVD businesses grew more than 50% combined in calendar 2014, which is 1.5x the rate of the Etch and CVD markets and over 2x the rate of our largest competitor in these areas. Our latest Etch platform is generating traction in foundry, as well as memory. We have a task force in place to drive our Etch gross margins to higher levels as we mature our new chamber technology and increase our scale. In foundry, our investment and advanced deposition techniques is enabling strong adoption of CVD cobalt for interconnects, and new Epi steps in emerging nodes. In Logic, we have nearly doubled the number of D2R wins in the past 2 years, which is a good leading indicator of share gains in next-generation transistors. And finally, over the last 2 years, we have tripled our corporate technology groups funding of disruptive new products and markets for our longer-term growth. In short, we are seeing strong early returns for our growth initiatives within FSG, Display and AGS that will allow us to grow revenues and profitability, particularly as our customers ramp new nodes into higher volumes. Next, I'll summarize our first quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.3 billion were up 1% sequentially, with increases in FSG and EES, offsetting decreases in AGS and Display. Although AGS orders were down from our Q4 record, they were the second highest ever and up 16% from Q1 of 2014. Net sales of $2.4 billion were near the high end of our expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.3%. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $552 million were near the low end of guidance. As a reminder, many of our groups had a holiday shutdown during the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 was at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating cash flow of $60 million, reflecting high revenue from Display tools that were previously secured with cash in advance. In Q1, we also had annual incentive compensation and withholding tax payments. Absent the timing of these items, operating cash flow remains strong. Now I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. FSG orders of $1.4 billion were up 7%, with increases in memory, offsetting decreases in foundry and Logic. FSG net sales of $1.4 billion were slightly above the midpoint of our expectations. FSG non-GAAP operating margin decreased slightly to 24.2%. AGS orders of $690 million were down 8% and remained at near-record levels. AGS net sales of $583 million were in line with our expectations and AGS non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1.7 points to 26.4%, reflecting favorable product mix. Display orders declined to $107 million, and we expect the booking pattern to remain lumpy. Display net sales of $275 million were up 45% as customers began to ramp the new TV capacity booked over the last 6 to 9 months. Display non-GAAP operating margin was 26.5%. EES orders grew slightly to $50 million and net sales of $55 million were below our expectations. EES both posted a small non-GAAP operating loss, and we continue to monitor the solar market closely. Now I'll provide our second quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to up a couple of points sequentially. Within this outlook, we expect FSG net sales to be up by about 4% to 8%. AGS net sales should be up by about 5% to 10%. We expect Display net sales to be approximately $160 million, and EES net sales should be approximately $75 million. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately flat. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $570 million, plus or minus $10 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.30. Now let me turn the call back over to Mike for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Bob. [Operator Instructions] Dustin, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Bob, can you give us the specific SSG order breakout by memory, foundry? And then maybe within memory, can you give us DRAM and NAND?
Robert J. Halliday: Sure. Let me take it out. Yes, in Q1, foundry was a little under 500. Memory total was about 700, a little over, and Logic and other was about 200.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, Bob, I just wanted to ask about margins. You talked about the second half being stronger. It sounds like fiscal second half revenue is going to be up versus fiscal first half, but the margins in the fiscal first half have been a little bit under pressure. Can you speak to why that's been the case? And will the margin pressure lift during the fiscal back half the year? Of course, this is on a standalone basis X the merger, obviously. But will that margin pressure lift during the fiscal back half of the year?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, it should. The biggest thing that's going on is mix for us within SSG. So SSG we're doing very well and gaining share in Etch, particularly in memory. So if you look at memory, I think over 50%, 52% of orders in the first couple of quarters are memory-related, which is a high point for us. And a lot of that drive is Etch and CVD. Etch, we're shipping new tools. Our C3 chamber is doing really well. So that's dragging margin a little bit and what we usually see as we see foundry picking up around a little stronger, a little sooner and the mix of tools there is a little better for us and the margins. So the mix is hurting us a little bit. We had some of this in the first -- early part of last year, but foundry picked up a little early last year. So it should go better in the second half but that's what's going on.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, Tim, one thing I'd say is that, I think, the good news is that we're getting great traction with some of our new products, including products in Etch and CVD, and some of the fastest ramp rates that we've ever seen for new products. But the start-up costs there are also higher and then over time, we can work those back down.
Operator: Our next question comes from that line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: First, Gary or Bob, if I look at foundry spending over the last few years, it's always been front half loaded, which kind of makes sense given end consumer products release in the second half. What is different this time around that foundry is actually back half loaded?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes. Well, that's a question we talked a lot about, too. I'll tell you my opinion. Typically, it's first half loaded and last year, it was even a little earlier than previous years, in my opinion, because a leading foundry had the Apple business and they wanted to ramp very effectively. So things like our Epi tools, they took a little earlier even to make sure they're working well and they had a good ramp. This year, it's not clear how many -- when the cutover to FinFET devices are. So all the customers are saying they're going to ramp FinFET, spend a lot of money, but it looks like the ramp of that is a little later and part of that is also impacted by what is the relative rate of reuse of tools, too. So it was probably a little bit early last year and it seems a little bit later than the average this year.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it, got it. All right. And then as a follow-up, on the conductor etch side, you guys mentioned significant wins last year. I'm kind of curious, when you quantify wins, is it by revenue shift or is it by units share? And also, which specific segments? Was it more on the DRAM NAND side or was it more on the foundry side?
Robert J. Halliday: It was revenue dollars as measured by Dataquest, and it will be in memory. We did pretty well in DRAM and NAND. And we're pretty optimistic we'll do well again in calendar '15.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, we also have traction in foundry. But as Bob said, the majority of the share gains right now were in memory. If you look over the last couple of years, in Etch and conductor etch, we talked about 5 points of conductor etch share gain this year. We had 6 points of share gain last year in 2013. So we have really significant momentum. Certainly, memory is where we see the largest revenue now, but we also have traction outside of memory that provides an opportunity for growth going forward. And the other thing as we talked about, the Etch and CVD revenues combined increase greater than 50% in 2014. So if you look at the growth rates of those markets, in both of those areas, we're significantly outgrowing the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I appreciate your comments on the transaction. Having said that, a lot of people are sort of stumped as to why the transaction is taking so long. And I realize that you guys are limited in what you can say. But I'm kind of hopeful that you can provide us some additional color. And I guess just what gives you confidence that this process isn't going to continue to drag on beyond the first half the year? That's my first question.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, I think the reason it's complicated is because we have a very complicated business. If you look between us and Tokyo Electron, many, many different segments, many different products. And so I think that's a higher degree of complexity than you normally see in this type of situation. What we said earlier was that we're making progress with regulators. And we're going to close the merger as soon as we can. We really can't talk any -- say anything more at this point beyond that.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay. And then I guess my other comment is just on mix. You mentioned that memory is really strong here in the first half. Are you guys -- I guess how should we think about memory in the second half? Is there concern that we may see a sharp fall off and maybe offset some of the growth that you're expecting in foundry?
Robert J. Halliday: Well, we all have our opinions. I think you have to look at the fiscal halves and the calendar halves. As you know, our fiscal half is -- we end our fiscal year in October 31. My belief is that the second half foundry is stronger than typical, as I said, before. We think memory is stronger in the first half although I think there's a little upside to the memory outlook quite frankly. So I don't think memory is going to follow off if you look at pricing. I'll give you another data point. Utilization across all the fabs is running pretty darn high right now. So that I think that the forecast is pretty good, just timing and mix issues really.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: My first question is regarding the foundry investment this year. I just wanted to make sure I understand the linearity of it a little bit better. You mentioned that's stronger in the second half. Just given the timing of the end consumer devices and the ramp associated with it, is it fair to think like the strength would be more stronger in the July quarter than the October quarter?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, I'll try and take that one. Right now, we think that the July and October quarters are pretty strong. We think right now that -- they're pretty close actually. I'm looking at the data. July might be a little stronger than October, but they're pretty close.
Gary E. Dickerson: One other thing I would say on the foundry business is that this is a huge competitive battle for our customers. So I would expect there's going to be more technology buys also than we would normally see. There's certainly the race to the first generation FinFET but there's also, in parallel, a tremendous pull from customers as they drive to second generation FinFET from a technology perspective. So that's another thing that we see very strong pull from customers that could play out. And we're talking about second half of our fiscal year. So it could play out a little bit more in the second half of our fiscal year.
Farhan Ahmad - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then one question on the market share. You mentioned that AMAT gained share in WFE this year. But when I look at your revenues, they're up 12% year-on-year like just for the calendar year and I'm kind of using the Jan ending revenues for the last 12 months. They're up 12% year-on-year and you mentioned that WFE was up 15%. So I just wanted to understand like if WFE is up 15% and your revenues are up 12% then how are you gaining share?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, let me see if I can help that one. I think on the -- so we gained share in '13 and that's in the Dataquest, I think about 1.4, whatever it was. On WFE, I think we held share in calendar '14 on WFE. I don't think we gained. I think we gained or held share at every single product group in which we competed, but some of our large share product groups didn't outgrow the WFE. So on WFE, I think we're flat. Across all other product groups, we gained or held except one we lost.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, let me just -- on the last question, one final point. We also had a strong November, December. So that will help you understand it, too.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Bob, if I look at your outlook for SSG, up 48%. Is that in line with your peers given your mix is a little bit more foundry-centric, but the nonsemi markets are, like you said, a bit lumpy. So can you provide a bit more color on what what's happening in the Display market near term in its seasonality? And then on the EES, is that being impacted by oil prices being lower? And then I have a follow-up.
Robert J. Halliday: So the first question was the foundry spending mix, is this what you're asking, Atif?
Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: No, what's going on with the nonsemi markets and Display and EES? Can you give a little bit more color?
Robert J. Halliday: Sure. Nonesemi, I'll do solar first. On solar, we're managing that pretty darn well and the market, the end-used market for solar panels and solar cells is pretty good. But there still is an overhang of excess capacity out there that's being eaten up. So it's sort of a neutral market, it's treading water. And so it's just quarter-to-quarter variations on small numbers. In the Display market, our position has been very strong in Display. We've gained share, we've come up with new products, execution has been a very good and that market is made up of 2 primary customer types, Display equipment we sell for TVs and Display equipment we sell for smaller form factors like iPhone -- cell phones and pads, iPad-type things. So if you look at it, this year looks like bookings will be a little bit more swinging towards the smaller form factors. And so what we're doing is the build out of TVs which are helping revenues. So we've got really big bookings last year if you remember that was shipping those. This year, we think the bookings on TVs will be a little less, but the bigger -- the smaller form factors will be greater. So that's the transition that's going on there.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then you had $63 million in adjustments in your backlog on FX. Can you talk about the headwinds from here on FX in your exposure?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, that's a good question, too. So as you know, that yen is down significantly and euro softened up. So no. The yen is the bigger impact for us. Now as a practical matter, the way we sell, most of our costs are in dollar-denominated and our revenues are fundamentally dollar-denominated. Now when we priced in Japan, we are somewhat competitive to Japanese competitors, but we largely price in dollars and translate that into yen and largely hedge the impact. So we can somewhat differ the impact. So I'd say that the yen to Applied alone is not a big impact. It's a little bit more impactful to Tokyo Electron who bills in yen.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I know you talked about a stronger second half driven by foundry and continued memory and within that, a strong July quarter. So just to clarify, you guys are seeing foundry and memory being strong contributors in July? And if foundry is indeed starting to become stronger in July, is it more than just one customer? Is a little bit more broad-based than that?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, we see that the foundry is picking up in the second half. So the mix of spending by half. Foundry is more heavily weighted to our -- to the calendar second half and our fiscal second half. Memory is more weighted to the calendar first half and to our fiscal first half. So that's the mix. If you ask me, I think there's a little bit of upside to what we think on memory in the second half, particularly DRAM. In terms of absolute dollars, I think because the mix is heavier on memory in the first half, the dollar is probably a little bigger in the first half. And then the other wildcard is 3D NAND could be an opportunity later in the year.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. Okay. And then you typically have a step-up in OpEx in Q2, as you just guided to. How should we expect that to trend in Q3 and Q4, especially as the team continues to invest heavily on growth opportunities?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes. Last quarter, I talked about our spending is up a little bit this year. I thought we might even get up closer to $570 million, $575 million. We're trying to manage that tightly. We had the benefit of a shutdown this quarter. We guided to $570 million, plus or minus, $10 million in Q2. Q3 I think and Q4 were sort of in the same range, up a few million, in the $570 million is my guess.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I just had a couple of questions and this is probably beating a dead horse. But just on the foundry demand, I'm really just trying to reconcile what I heard from TSMC which is that they raised CapEx by around 24% and Samsung, which said that foundry CapEx would be up year-over-year. With your view that foundry spending should be kind of flat or maybe up in 2015, is there a way to reconcile that? Are you hearing -- you're seeing a good visibility into this but are you hearing maybe something a little different than maybe what the companies are indicating? And then I have a follow-up.
Robert J. Halliday: I think global foundry is probably down year-on-year is my guess, and UMC is up a little bit or flat. And then the other issue -- so I think the other thing is that calendar fiscal we sort of are a little bit conservative just because our fiscal year ends in October. So it could be slipping to November, December, too, which makes us a little worried. But overall, we're seeing it's up a little bit overall, foundry.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, good. And then just on the other side, back to the currency question. It seems like you should get maybe a little bit of gross margin uplift from some of your foreign production. But yet, you're modeling gross margin kind of flattish. And I am wondering why you're not getting a little bit of uplift maybe from the foreign exchange or currency discrepancy?
Robert J. Halliday: Oh, in terms of our...
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Or manufacturing and selling in dollars?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, we don't do heavy manufacturing overseas. Most of what our product costs is materials. The majority -- vast majority of our material cost is dollar-denominated. So we haven't got a lot of benefit there. We're trying to get some more benefit but the vast majority of our product costs is dollars.
Operator: Our next question comes from that line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Gary, maybe just, first, from an industry perspective. Given some of the uncertainty and the timing of this foundry FinFET ramp. Do you believe it's weighted more towards the uncertainty in terms of the customer allocation of the capacity to the foundries or the yield challenges that the industry is facing right now?
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, Patrick, that's a very good question. Certainly, this is the -- a major competitive battle for our customers and everybody is focused on -- as I said before, not just first generation but also second generation FinFET. So for us, when we -- I think one of the other callers, maybe it was Wes, I talked about announcements from customers, TSMC and Samsung being pretty bullish on CapEx. I think for us, the uncertainty, as you said, is around allocation. Where are those dollars going to go? They're going to go to one of those different companies and so there's still some uncertainty around that. I think that for all of these companies, this is a huge bet. This is the biggest change in terms of the transistor technology that we've seen in a very, very long time. So all of these companies are extremely focused. They're investing a lot also in technology so they can shorten their cycle between first generation and second generation and all of that is very good to us because, as we've said before, our total available market increases a significant amount and we're very leveraged around the transistor. Our businesses like Epi and PVD are extremely strong, implants, a number of different areas. So for us, we're in a very good position no matter who that business goes to because the TAM for us is so much larger. But when we talk about the uncertainty, it's really what I just discussed.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Great. That's helpful. Maybe for Bob. Just kind of following up on some of the uncertainty with the foundry ramp. How are you managing the supply chain as well as the inventory given the uncertainties out there? How are you going to -- I guess, with the pulls and pushes on the levers on that front?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, that's a good question, Patrick. We actually think our demand on the supply chain is going to be pretty high for 2 reasons. One, our sales of spare parts are pretty strong, as you can see in our AGS business, and with fab utilization running pretty high. We think the spare parts that we ship a lot of will be pretty high, so we'll buy those from suppliers. And the second thing is if we get this steep way up in this second half, we'll get a lot of pull. So overall, demand on suppliers is going to be pretty high. Some of those tools and inventory we have brought in now to mitigate the risk of the ramp, so you see our inventory is up a little bit. And then the third thing we're going to take a look at is we're spending a lot of time handholding, working closely with suppliers to make sure that ramp goes okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC.
Shawn Yuan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: This is Shawn Yuan for Mahesh. First, you mentioned WFE up 5% or more this year. This is relatively lower than some of the peers are commenting and it's certainly lower than -- I think people are thinking about 5% to 10% -- up 5% to 10% range. So are you guys seeing anything differently from your peers? And then do you think in the long-term model, you guys are thinking about 30 17 [ph] in WFE [indiscernible] 17. And do you think in this year or next, we may see maybe 1 or 2 quarter WFE run rate when they reach that level?
Robert J. Halliday: No, I think we're pretty close on the WFE. We're sort of around the $34 billion number. I think everybody else is pretty close to that.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, I think what we said was 5% or more. I think LAM was 0% to 13%, if I remember correctly. So we're really in the same range.
Shawn Yuan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then another comment you made in the prepared remark is that 3D NAND spending will be about twice of 2014 level. And some of your customers in their earnings indicate that they're planning to reuse some tools for 3D NAND development. I'm just wondering, can you talk about your assumptions on your 3D NAND spending for 2015?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, that's a good question. So 3D NAND is really, for us, really major opportunity from a growth perspective. It is very focused on Etch and deposition and not so much on litho. So the feature sizes are actually increasing as they go from planar to 3D NAND, but there is a lot of spending on Etch and deposition systems. And the process is very different than the planar NAND. So it is true that there's reuse but for us, in our business, there's a huge opportunity for TAM growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: So just a longer-term question here. Curious what you think the current spending patterns are in China? And if you expect them to go up materially over the next couple for years. And then what your percentage of that market is on a relative basis.
Gary E. Dickerson: So we -- thanks for the question. We don't really see a significant change in the CapEx spending in China. Actually, our position there is very, very strong. The leading foundry in China, we have a great relationship, our share there is very high. In general, foundry is an area where we have high share at all customers. But in China, we have a very, very good position, very good relationship. So if that spending would ramp, that would be a good thing for us. But we really don't see a big change there in the next year or 2.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe switching gears to the Display business. If the manufacturers were to switch to OLED TVs, does that materially impact the equipment market size?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, OLED is -- basically, if you look at the number of deposition steps and the number of steps that we participate in, if you compare amorphous silicon to OLED, it's about 2x the total available market opportunity for us. So certainly, OLED ramping would be very good for our Display business. Overall -- there was a question earlier on Display. That group has really done an incredible job. They are gaining share in the market. And when we look at our model for the company, Display really is pretty much on model versus what we had discussed a couple of years ago. Growing share, really focused on how we help customers make these technology transitions from amorphous silicon to LTPS, metal oxide. And OLED really is the best opportunity for us when that technology ramps.
Operator: Our next question comes from that line of Edwin Mok with Needham.
Yeuk-Fai Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So just quickly follow up on gross margin. I think you guys guided for flattish this quarter. And I noticed you have some pretty strong DRAM order, I mean, DRAM is very concentrated in the space. Now does those big orders have any effect on gross margin for this quarter? And also, does the timing of the Chinese New Year maybe have an effect on timing of the shipments, which impact gross margin?
Robert J. Halliday: Sure. The biggest single swing for us within the SSG business is what tool types we ship. So Etch is -- we're gaining share and Etch, particularly in memory, we're getting more D2R positions, making progress in foundry and places like that. We get a lot of sales in Etch, high aspect ratio Etch and also all types of Etch steps and depositions steps seen in NAND and DRAM. So it's that tool mix that's different for us in memory versus foundry. Foundry, we tend to be very high shares, strong positions in tools like Epi, PVD, implants, things like that. But it's the tool mix between the 2 that's the biggest driver.
Yeuk-Fai Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then on your commentary about Etch plus CVD growing by 50% just last year, right? And I think someone asked you about what happened to your other business and you mentioned that you held share with some of the market may have shrinked a little bit. I'm trying to dive in a little bit into that. Is it just because its type of spending that caused that, some of those other product market -- or product market has shrunk? Or is that something else going on or is it just customer investing in other areas? Can you give us some color on that?
Robert J. Halliday: Sure. We held overall WFE share. We gain an Etch CVD. We lost some in wafer defect and inspection. Frankly, that will come out in a month or 2. So we'll share that with you. Some of the others we held shared or gained share but the TAMs didn't grow as fast as Etch and CVD. So we're getting share in Etch and CVD, holding very high share in some other strong markets. But a couple of the other markets, like implant didn't grow quite as fast as some of the other markets. So it's a mix within the businesses as much as anything.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. One of the things relative to the overall market, the overall wafer inspection business actually grew less than we had thought it would in 2014 and slower than the overall market growth. So that was a negative. Optical wafer inspection, as Bob said, we lost some share due to the customer mix in 2014. E-beam, where we have technology leadership, we actually gained share in e-beam review, about 15 points of share, we think, in e-beam review. We gained share in CD metrology and we think that e-beam inspection is also an opportunity for us. So in '15, what we think is that the mix will be more favorable for us and really, the area that is growing the fastest in e-beam technology, we have very, very strong position with some new products and we look at that as a growth opportunity for us in 2015.
Operator: Our next question comes from that line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: You and your competitors in the past have talked about, I guess, over the next few years FinFET and 3D NAND are the bigger incremental opportunities than more like in DRAM and advanced packaging. Yet, most of the upside in recent quarters have been coming from DRAM. So do you think this is just a timing issue because FinFET and 3D NAND is being pushed out? Or do you think the capital intensity for DRAM is higher than you previously thought?
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, I think DRAM is certainly up and we talked about what the drivers are for the DRAM business. But the timing for 3D NAND is later than what some people had expected. I think everyone is seeing very strong pull for 3D NAND. There's compelling pull from customers around the performance of the 3D NAND technology. And when you look at bit scaling over the longer term, that is the direction for every single one of our customers. There's a huge focus there and we -- although it's later than what we had expected, we start -- we see the second half of this year switch over in 3D NAND being more significant. And FinFET is also a great opportunity. It is the #1 competitive battleground for all of the foundry customers. And we certainly see that all of the customers will move to that technology. And we look at that being more heavily weighted toward the second half of this year and into 2016.
Sidney Ho - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Then my follow-up question is, given the slower ramp of FinFET, how would you characterize the industry investment and capacity of 28-nanometers and 20-nanometers relative to what you think, let's say, 6 months ago?
Robert J. Halliday: Well, we think this year is heavily weighted towards FinFET versus 28. In terms of 20, some of the tools sets are the same for 20 and FinFET. So it's a little hard to make a clear delineation of that, but we think it's more mostly FinFET, 16- to 14-nanometer ramping, but some of the tools you could use between 20 and 16 or 14. So I think it's just heavily weighted towards FinFET. The issue is I think it's a little later in the year than last year. Last year was a little early than normal. This year is a later than normal, I'd say.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, 28 was the majority of the spending. 28-nanometer is the majority of spending in 2014. If you look at 2015 spending, what we're projecting, it's by far very heavily weighted to 14- and 16-nanometer technology.
Operator: Our next question comes from that line of Srini Sundar [ph] with Summitt [indiscernible].
Unknown Analyst: My first question is what gives you any confidence that the merger will go through? And based on the prior approvals, what were the main points that you have to win to get the approval, assume that I have not gotten a memo that you cannot talk on the merger.
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, thanks for the question. The -- as we said before, we really can't give you any more color than what we had discussed before. What we have said is that we are making progress with regulators. We believe that this is the right strategy for our companies to come together. We think there are -- it's a great strategic opportunity. All of the people involved are very excited. But unfortunately, we really can't say anything more than that.
Unknown Analyst: Sure. No problem. Second thing is on the -- what are the basic differences between the first generation FinFET to second generation FinFET? And how would you guys be advantaged by going to the next generation FinFET?
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, the FinFET technology is really very heavily weighted, if you look at Epi for instance. The number of Epi steps continue to grow and that's just a tremendous opportunity for us. NDP steps also are -- that's a great TAM for us and FinFET. We're also seeing actually a next-generation FinFET technologies, more opportunities in areas like implant. The customers are very focused on trying to drive down the cost of multiple patterning but the number of steps are certainly increasing. We have some technologies we talked about, selective material removal being an area that we see very high growth. And that's another area that we believe is going to be a big focus for our customers certainly as they go to second generation FinFETs. So our strength is really around the transistor and that's what FinFET is all about and so that leverages many areas where we have technology leadership.
Operator: The last question comes from that line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG International.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Gary, I want to better understand your assumption for 3D NAND. When I talk to your customers, they all argue that when 3D NAND is still in commercialized, the CapEx for that is actually going to go down because the density per wafer is going to go up dramatically. So how can I reconcile your growth expectations with what your company -- with what your customers are saying? Especially when we think about CapEx per wafer compared to bits of NAND manufacturer per wafer? And I have a follow-up.
Gary E. Dickerson: Okay. Thanks for the question. As I said earlier, when you look at -- I think we've shown also in Investor Day and there's been at least 2 customers that have publicly talked about CapEx spending and the breakdown of CapEx spending for planar versus 3D NAND. The big change is that for the litho area, the CapEx spending is going to be lower. The Etch deposition and even Epi for us, we're seeing growth in 3D NAND. So the shift in the CapEx spending is going to be very significant in planar to 3D NAND. But the areas I just talked about are areas where we have very good position as customers are ramping these new technologies and we see very strong pull as they go to the first and second generation FinFET technologies.
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, I think related to that is -- it's the tool mix, it's more Etch and deposition versus litho. The second thing is because of that and you have a different tool set, the level of reuse is less. So if you look from a reuse model, which they've been pursuing pretty effectively to basically a pseudo-Greenfield model with a different device type, the tool mix is much more favorable for ourselves and other Etch and deposition companies.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Got it. And then one follow-up. Based on the funding commission, it seems like the merger agreement is going to expire March 24. And given how FX is favoring Tokyo Electron, wouldn't they be more enticed to maybe change the details of the agreement because exchange rate is going to their favor?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, we really can't -- unfortunately, as I've talked about before, I think both companies strongly believe in the strategy. I think if anything, as we work together, we're more -- there's even a stronger belief that this combination will create value for customers and be just really a great opportunity. The working relationships are tremendous. And as I said before, we're making progress. We can't unfortunately, give any more color on the merger.
Michael Sullivan: Well, thanks, Mehdi, for your question. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Dustin. Today, we'll discuss the results of our fourth quarter and our 2014 fiscal year, which ended on October 26. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO; and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including our current view of the company's industries and our performance, products, strategies, opportunities, announced business combination with Tokyo Electron and business outlook. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied, and they should be interpreted in that light. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in our most recent Form 8-K and 10-Q filings with the SEC.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. In our fourth quarter, Applied Materials delivered revenue and earnings at the midpoint of our target range. This rounds out a strong year for Applied, where we grew sales in our semiconductor business by 25%, and expanded our overall operating margins by 6 points. These results reflect ongoing technology and capacity investments by our semiconductor and display customers, sustainable market share gains in growing markets and significant improvements in our operating performance that we've achieved while increasing investment in new product development. Our progress towards our strategic and financial goals is made possible by outstanding contributions from our employees around the world. This is a team with tremendous passion to create value for customers and investors. Over the past 2 years, we have placed Applied on a trajectory of long-term profitable growth and improving financial performance. In 2013, we aligned the business around our precision materials engineering strategy and took steps to shape a more competitive company. We increased our focus on areas that have the biggest impact for customers and generate the best returns for Applied. We shifted spending from low-growth businesses and corporate functions to field resources and product development. We built a stronger organization, bringing in top industry talent, strengthening our business processes for repeatable success and changing our structure to improve alignment and speed. We increased our market share with 1.4 points of overall gains in calendar 2013, and we invested in a pipeline of new products to enable our customers' roadmaps and drive long-term growth for Applied. In 2014, we accelerated this strategy and made strong progress towards our financial model. Our semiconductor business posted the highest revenue since fiscal 2007. And for the calendar year, we expect to gain share or hold share in almost all of our businesses. We anticipate our largest gains in areas of the market that are growing the fastest. In CVD, we believe we will win at least 3 points of share this year. And in etch, we are on track to deliver almost 2.5x the sales achieved in 2012. These results demonstrate that we have the right strategy and the right team, that we are improving our execution and carrying strong momentum into 2015. Our merger with Tokyo Electron will enable us to further accelerate this strategy. The detailed plans to bring the 2 companies together are now very well advanced. Our joint integration team is working closely together to make the merger a success, and the progress they've made has far exceeded our expectations. In terms of the regulatory process, we have been advised to not provide details or answer questions about ongoing discussions. However, I'm pleased to report that the German Competition Authority notified us today that we have received its unconditional approval for the proposed business combination. We are working hard to obtain the remaining approvals as soon as we can. However, we acknowledge that the closing could move into the first quarter of next year. Turning to our market outlook. Consumer demand for new and better mobile devices with more features and longer battery life remains the primary driver for the semiconductor industry. This is fueling strong foundry investment in leading-edge technology. Overall, foundry spending in 2014 is on track for 20% to 25% growth year-over-year, and these high spending levels are expected to be sustained in 2015. This year, almost half of the foundry spending was focused on 20 nanometer, and the build-out of this node is nearly complete at the leading customers. 2015 is shaping up to be the year of a FinFET leadership battle, and we anticipate strong investment from our customers as they focus on winning this critical transition. Memory spending has also been robust in 2014, and we expect higher investment levels next year. NAND bit growth is around 40% this year, driven by increasing bits per box for new mobile devices and strong demand for solid-state storage. The bulk of incremental supply has been provided by advanced planar technology. In 2015, spending on 3D NAND is expected to be broader and larger, although still not to surpass planar investment until 2016. DRAM investment was stronger than expected at the start of the year, driven by mobile and an enterprise-led PC replacement cycle. DRAM bit growth is around 30%, and with this demand being primarily met by technology conversions. In 2015, we expect supply to remain tight with strong potential for new capacity additions. Looking at wafer fab equipment as a whole. We maintain that 2014 spending will be up 10% to 20% over 2013. Our current view is that 2015 wafer fab equipment will be higher, driven by the foundry FinFET battle, more customers investing in 3D NAND and increasing DRAM spending. In addition, over the last 12 months, wafer starts and fab utilization have increased, a trend that we expect to continue in 2015. As the customers aggressively push factory output, we see expanded opportunities for our AGS business. The outlook for the display equipment market also remains very healthy. Attractive price points for 4K TVs are driving a TV refresh cycle, while average screen sizes are growing around twice as fast as historic rates. Demand for higher-resolution, lower-power screens for mobile devices is also a key factor in display, and we are seeing strong LTPS orders for this market. Our quarterly display revenues are at a 3-year high, and we believe we're on track to gain share in our served available market this year. In both semiconductor and Display, major changes in device technology provide a catalyst for our growth. As we've said before, FinFET and 3D NAND represent the biggest technology transitions in decades. These complex inflections are enabled by materials innovation, and that plays directly to Applied's strengths. They create new precision materials engineering steps, expand our available market and fuel strong demand for our enabling leadership products in transistor and interconnect. For example, our Epi business posted record sales for the fiscal year. Our metal deposition group delivered its highest annual revenues and operating margins since 2000. And we believe our implant group is on track to reach its highest ever market share. In logic and memory, the acceleration of materials-enabled scaling is a major driver for etch and deposition. These are large growth opportunities for Applied, where we are building strong momentum and gaining share. We now expect our combined revenues in etch and CVD to grow by almost 50% in calendar 2014. We see strong customer pull for our next-generation technologies. At SEMICON West, we announced 5 new products that are rapidly gaining traction, and we have now shipped more than 300 of these chambers. We have also been making improvements to our service and spares business to better support customers as they quickly ramp these new device technologies at the right yield and cost. Our service organization is building momentum and in fiscal 2014, delivered the highest orders and the highest operating margins since 2007. In summary, for Applied Materials, fiscal 2014 was a year when we grew faster than our markets and made significant progress towards our strategic and financial goals. We accelerated our product momentum and strengthened the organization in key areas. Looking forward to 2015. We expect a year of industry growth, where we are uniquely positioned to apply our capabilities in precision materials engineering and outgrow the industry. In order to take full advantage of the great opportunities ahead, we remain highly focused on improving execution. Let me now hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional details about our performance and explain the steps we are taking to drive alignment, speed and scale across the organization. Bob?
Robert J. Halliday: Thanks, Gary. In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year improvements across many areas of our business and achieved our guidance for revenue and EPS. Since this is the end of our fiscal year, let me begin by framing 2014 in the context of where we have been and where we are going. We continue to believe that the market environment looks good, particularly for Applied Materials, and remains good for some time. This environment gives us a great opportunity to make money and efficiently return it to investors. There are 3 levers to making more money in our industry: first, understand customers' high-value problems and develop disruptive new products, as Gary described; second, achieve scale around our opportunities. We are doing this by focusing on our biggest opportunities in SSG and Display, winning share and merger with Tokyo Electron; and third, relentlessly grind away on efficiency, execution and cost. In 2013, we shifted money to our biggest growth opportunities, primarily in SSG and Display. We also gained share in the overall WFE market, primarily by focusing on key battlegrounds, customer support and rapid product iteration. Our new and disruptive products were still early in the development stage. In 2014, we further accelerated our funding of products that give us the greatest opportunities for growth. For example, we increased the combined funding of our conductor etch and CVD opportunities at 3x the rate of our overall investment. This past year, we began to see strong momentum from these products, as our combined revenue in conductor etch and CVD grew by 60% in fiscal 2014. Thanks to our employees' efforts, we also kept grinding away on efficiency, execution and cost. For example, in 2014, we shifted an additional $200 million from our corporate functions and lower-return programs to fund our strongest opportunities in 300 millimeter and emerging technologies. We also achieved our 2% of materials cost savings for the year. As a result, we began to see signs of progress toward the target financial model we introduced in 2013. In fiscal 2014, the company recorded revenue of $9.1 billion. Excluding solar, this was the highest company revenue in 7 years, which demonstrated our strong momentum in SSG, Display and AGS. On a non-GAAP basis, we increased gross margin to 44.1%, which was a 7-year high. This gross margin for the year did benefit from 0.5 point of non-run rate items. We increased operating margin by 6 points even as we maintained elevated R&D investments in our new product pipeline. We also achieved a 3-year high in both operating margin and net income. Our tax rate of 22.7% declined by 1.8 points as we implemented our more efficient structure, and we boosted our earnings by over 80% to $1.07 per share. Now let's take a look at some of our 2014 segment results. SSG revenue grew by 25% to the highest level in 7 years. NAND orders were also at a 7-year high. In AGS, orders were at a 7-year high, which reflects customer pull for advanced service offerings enabled by our tighter collaboration between SSG and AGS. AGS operating margin was the highest since 2007. In Display, orders achieved a 6-year high as the group took advantage of technology inflections and panel-size increases in the TV and mobile display markets. The Display group gained share and increased its operating margin to its highest level since 2011. EES generated a modest profit for the first time since the solar downturn. Now what do see entering 2015? Our industry outlook is positive, and while it is too early to know the effects of timing and mix, we expect continued year-over-year growth and progress toward our target model. In 2015, we plan to introduce some of the new and disruptive products from our product pipeline investments. These products will drive share gains in 2015 and over time, but have lower margins initially. In 2015, we are working to further improve our gross margin even with aggressive new product ramps. In the first quarter, we expect gross margins to be lower sequentially, primarily due to share gains in our conductor etch business. Specifically, we expect our etch revenue to grow by almost 60% sequentially in Q1. We expect to increase our gross margins from Q1 through the balance of 2015. Overall, 2015 provides us with a further opportunity to systematically gain share in the fastest growing markets; drive scale in semiconductor display and services, both standalone and in combination with Tokyo Electron; and grind away at execution, efficiency and cost to improve the profitability of the company. Now I will provide more color on our fourth quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.3 billion were down 9% sequentially, with decreases primarily in SSG and Display, partially offset by an increase in AGS. Net sales of $2.3 billion were in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin decreased to 44.2%, which included a 0.5 point of non-recurring benefits. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.27 was in line with our guidance. Our operating cash flow was $407 million or 18% of revenue. Next, I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.3 billion were down 15%, with decreases in memory and foundry more than offsetting increases in logic and other. SSG net sales of $1.4 billion were down 3%, in line with expectations. AGS orders of $747 million were up 35%, led by service contracts, and were the highest since 2007. AGS net sales of $592 million were better than expected. Display orders declined to $130 million, and we expect the pattern to remain lumpy. Display net sales of $190 million were up 60% as we began to ship the large orders received in the last 6 to 9 months. This quarterly revenue performance is also a 3-year high. EES orders were $44 million, and net sales were $48 million. Now I will provide our first quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to up 5% sequentially. Our normal seasonal pattern would be for revenue to increase in our second quarter. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be approximately flat. AGS net sales should be down by a couple of points. We expect Display net sales to be up by about 40% and EES net sales should be up by about $20 million. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 43%. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be in the range of $560 million, plus or minus $10 million, which includes 1 month of annual merit adjustments and the holiday shutdown. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29. In summary, 2014 was a year of growth and improved profitability across all of Applied, including 25% revenue growth in SSG and 6 points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement for the whole company. In 2015, we believe we can increase revenue across all of our segments, gain share in SSG and further improve operating margin. Now let me turn the call back over to Mike Sullivan for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions] Dustin, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.
Christopher J. Muse - Evercore ISI, Research Division: I guess, first question on gross margin side. In terms of the downtick in the January quarter and then your positive outlook for the rest of the year, specific to January, is that particularly the new products on the conductor etch side? Or is that also reflecting a mix to only a handful of customers? And then, as you look beyond that, what gives you the confidence that you'll see that gross margin uplift through the end of the year?
Robert J. Halliday: Sure, I'll take that one. Most of it's due to the heavy etch shipments. We're shipping some new tools, frankly, so typically, the installation, warranty costs, material costs are higher. As you look at the mix through the year, etch is strong throughout the year, but as a percentage of SSG sales, it goes down later on the year, and we start to get better on the cost side of the equation also.
Christopher J. Muse - Evercore ISI, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, as my follow-up -- and I understand you can't talk too much on the regulatory part. But are there any lateral implications that we should be taking from Germany's sign-off, particularly around talk around them working with the DOJ as well as the fact that it was an unconditional approval?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, we were pleased to get signed off in Germany. Each country is -- does an independent process. And we're working constructively on the whole process. And today was a good event for us. The rest of them, we're in process frankly.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Your target model for 2016, I think, is on $33.5 billion WFE, doing about $1.70 in EPS on just under $11 billion of revenue, if I'm not mistaken. How -- understanding you're ramping new products, which are a little bit lower margin, and there's some share gain in some lower-margin areas and also, that that's a 2016 model, not a 2015 model, it does look like we'll be at, at least $33.5 billion in WFE in 2015 now. So how much lower than that 2016 model do you think we'd be in 2015 if we do get to the $33.5 billion, given the pushes and pulls on the target model?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, it's a good question, Jim. Let me walk through it little bit. If you go look at the revenue line, we're actually making pretty good progress on the SSG share. We were probably, a year ago, a little behind on the AGS business, but we're picking up now. We had one of our strongest orders quarters ever. I think we're making real headway. So as you look through '15, '16, I can see reasonable revenue growth there. So we're going to get closer to the model and feel better there. The Display business is doing great, so that feels good. We got market share opportunities there. We're gaining. We have new products, so there's a lot of momentum there. And solar is even picking up a little bit. So I think the revenue line versus '16 is in the ballpark. Some of the new growthy stuff, we got to manage, but that's kind of lower-margin stuff, too. So the rev line's okay. Gross margin, we're kind of ahead of plan last year a little bit. So if you look at the $33.5 billion, I think we're supposed to be like 44.5%, I think, gross margin. We did about 44.1% on the year last year, up from about 40.9% back in '12, the base year. So I think we'll hit the gross margin model, maybe do a little better if we're lucky. So we'll do better I think. And then on expenses, we're a little bit above the expense line right now. I think we're going to work to manage that. We're investing real heavily in products, which drive the revenue line. If you look at where we're spending money, it's all in investment areas, not so much in overhead or cost areas. So overall, I'd say we're in the ballpark. The tax rate, we're making good progress. We should -- we hit 22%. We're probably -- might be a little bit of opportunity there. So net-net, we're in the ballpark. And we got a bunch of cash that we haven't done buybacks with, so the share count will come down, too.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's really helpful perspective. I appreciate that. For the follow-up, relative to the AGS orders, they were up a lot in the October quarter, and I think you said revenue would be down a little bit in that segment in the January quarter. Is that just kind of a seasonal uptick in orders in AGS? Or is there more of a structural component to that as well in terms of the big uptick in orders?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. I think, really, 2 areas of focus for us within AGS. One is the value that we provide for our customers. And there's been huge improvement in helping our customers get -- providing value for our customers as they ramp these new device technologies. You look at the FinFET or 3D NAND, these are really tough transitions. And getting the tools to the defect level they need to be, uniformity, stability, to the entitlement that the tools are capable of achieving, is really huge value to our customers. So we've actually seen an uptick in our contract revenue. We're combining labor and parts, and that's more sustainable from a service perspective. And there's been a huge focus on the value in helping our customers move through those transitions. The other thing is we're really driving cost. We're driving cost from a parts perspective, labor delivery perspective. So that combination, we think, the value as our customers are moving through these tough transitions and are driving and lowering cost, we think it creates a great combination for sustainable growth in the service business that, frankly, we didn't achieve in the past. But we're pretty optimistic that we can keep driving that going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: My first one is, Gary, you said that you expect WFE to grow 10% to 15% this year. When I look at the SSG revenue, it's probably growing somewhere in the low teens. I'm kind of curious, if you're gaining share, where is the disconnect? Is it because rev rec is going to take a while? Or is there something else happening? And then I had a follow-up.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. If you look at it overall wafer fab equipment share, last year, we gained 1.4%. What we said is SSG revenue's up 25% in -- from fiscal year to fiscal year. We haven't given any color certainly in terms of the calendar year. But I also had said earlier that we were pretty optimistic about wafer fab equipment increasing next year and that we would outgrow the industry. So if you look at the data points, kind of what's driving market share, these major technology transitions with FinFET and the memory transitions are really good for us relative to the TAM growth. We have TAM growth in those areas, very strong products. You see this in the foundry business with the record Epi sales, the metal deposition, the implant share. A number of those areas are extremely strong. And really -- so if you look at that, as customers are transitioning to these new transistors, these new FinFET devices, that's good for us. And also, in memory, we are also very well positioned. The etch and CVD share gains this year are going to create momentum for us going forward. As I talked about earlier, we have about 50% revenue growth in etch and CVD that we anticipate this year, and that provides, really, a great opportunity for us. So as these technology transitions happen going forward, we think we can build on the momentum that we have right now.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then a question for Bob. I know you can't answer questions on the merger, but just curious, there were some rules on the inversion path. Post merger, can you do buybacks without repatriating income back to the U.S.? And how much of your cash is onshore versus offshore?
Robert J. Halliday: I'll do the second one first. We're about half offshore, half onshore, and a little -- and some of the offshore stuff has already been provided through the tax provision. So it's -- the P&L impact's a little less than that. The second thing is, in terms of repatriation, we think we have a plan with our structure that we'll be able to efficiently return cash to investors and not have the substantive problem that you're talking about.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Gary, I was hoping you could maybe help quantify your comments around calendar year '15 WFE. Is there a range of up that you should expect to see? Kind of what's the puts and takes around that range? And I guess, importantly, a lot of your peers have been talking about a pretty good start to the first half of calendar year '15. I would love to kind of get your perspective on what half-on-half growth might look like from the second half of this year into the first half of next year at an industry level.
Gary E. Dickerson: Okay, yes. Overall, what we see for 2015 is still continued strong foundry investment and really heavily weighted to the FinFET transition for customers. That's a really big battle for all of the different companies. We're also seeing some really strong pull even into 10-nanometer pilot. That's a small amount, but really focused on these technology transitions is really, we believe, will sustain strong foundry investment in 2015. Looking at memory investment as being up next year. And so we -- that, we believe, will be a positive, and then logic, we think, is relatively flat versus '14. On the question on first half, second half, we're not really giving any guidance on first half, second half, unless Bob wants to do that. But what we do see is 2015 up. Really, we think increased investment in memory and a really sustained strong investment in foundry, really focused on technology transitions.
John William Pitzer - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Gary, that's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up for you, Gary. Some of your peers have talked about where we -- where they think we are in sort of the 2014 16-nanometer kind of build-out. I'd be curious from your perspective of what inning do you think the industry is in and where you think that might be by the middle of next year.
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, what we think is that 2015 is really going to be focused below 20 nanometer in terms of the majority of the investment. The -- it really is a huge focus. Every one of our customers in terms of coming out with lower-power, higher-performance devices, but power is a big driver, and so FinFET is a huge focus for every one of our customers. We -- there's always this war for mobility leadership. Every Christmas season, you see everyone competing for those slots in the new consumer devices, and FinFET is really the big focus for customers. So we see, from a CapEx standpoint in '15, that really being the majority of the investment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: A couple of things. First of all, Gary, there was some confusion recently around the amount of capacity for 2016 and '14 that'll be installed by the end of this year. There's different companies giving different numbers. So I'm wondering what your number is for the end of this year. It seems like the consensus is maybe 120,000 to 140,000 wafers a month, something like that.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, about 120,000 by the end of the year.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: 120k. And then, Bob, I just want to go back to a prior question about the September 2013 just from treasury. They really went after hopscotch and decontrol. But -- so I just wanted to be very clear that, that doesn't change your ability to get the tax synergies that you highlighted or to buy back the $3 billion that you indicated post the deal.
Robert J. Halliday: Pretty much. I think there might be a tiny bit of money on that margin that gets delayed a little bit, but fundamentally, yes, we're okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: The first question for Gary. Gary, you talked about the joint integration team has progressed faster than expectations. If you can provide a bit more color on what were the expectations and what metrics they've exceeded expectation? And relative to the $500 million OpEx synergies for the target model for 2017 for the combined companies, if we should be thinking of a higher synergy number? And then I have a follow-up.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, relative to the progress for the integration team, we've really focused on the areas that need -- the things that need to happen to hit the ground running on Day 1. So we've aligned around the organization structure, especially focusing on the areas of highest value creation within the new company. And when we're aligned there, the culture, the mission, vision, values that really guide the behavior for all of our employees, we've aligned around that. And also, the operating rhythm, how are we going to drive the business, all aspects of the business, our strategy, our execution, our decisions around portfolio planning, all of those kinds of things, all of those areas have -- are aligned and ready to go for Day 1 for the new company. And what I would say is that the more that we're together, the more excitement there is and the more opportunities we see to provide better products faster and at lower cost to our customers. And so again, on the organization, culture, operating rhythm, all of these areas, very, very strong alignment and strong alignment to create value for our customers and for our shareholders. So there's a lot of excitement within the team.
Robert J. Halliday: In terms of the $500 million, couple of things. One, if you look independently at Tokyo Electron, it had a really good year. I mean, they're doing well in their operating margins. Their share looks like it's in good shape. So you got to give them great deal of credit for really good execution themselves this year. In terms of the $500 million, I think that it's in the ballpark of the right numbers. That was a '17 number. I'd like to -- I think what we're going to plan to do is get the deal closed. Then, we'll have an investor meeting within a week after is my guess and update people on the model in more detail.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And as a follow-up, foundry orders have been tricky to call in terms of timing as your customers are waiting for their customers to decide on the next processor. Is it fair to assume that the flat guidance for January and then in April, the outlook that could be higher than January, that the swing factor is predominantly on the foundry side?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, if you go and look at it, I think it's a pretty strong DRAM period right now. I think that foundry has an opportunity to pick up. So I think your read on the situation's in the ballpark.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: On your higher WFE spending outlook for next year, as you mentioned, it does appear that it is weighted towards inflection technology spending. Can you just give us your view on the percent of the total mix that will be for inflection technology, FinFET, 20-nanometer DRAM, 3D NAND? Is it going to be 30% of WFE spend? 40%, majority of the spend? Any insights here would be appreciated.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. On the foundry investment, we think over 50% is going to be for sub-20 nanometer. And as I said earlier, that is a huge battleground for all of our customers. And there's some spending even all the way down to 10 nanometer on the pilot that is being pulled in by some of our customers. In NAND flash, the 3D NAND ramp has been slower than what we had anticipated. This year, the majority of the investment has been for planar NAND. And where we're looking at right now, we still think that in 2015, that the majority of spending will be in planar NAND technology, and the transition to 3D NAND in terms of majority of the CapEx, we think, is more in 2016. What we do see from customers and talking to multiple customers is very good performance with 3D NAND technology. And also, the potential for bit scaling in 3D NAND is pretty significant. It is a tough technology transition, so it's happening slower than I think some of the customers had anticipated. But still, from a performance and cost standpoint, there are very good reasons to make that transition, but we think that one is more in the 2016 time frame, where that becomes the majority of the CapEx spending.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then, Bob, you delivered on your target to drive a 2% reduction in materials cost. Can you just kind of help us understand? Is it more procurement driven or better platform design or a combination of both? And as you drive towards your 2016 model, how much more efficiencies can you drive in your COGS?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, the way we measure that is off the released bills of material pretty much. We get an incremental benefit through design, so most of that's engineering and purchasing working together. And AGS, everybody works together now. But the way we measure cost down is off a base number and how much we get off of that. Now what we're trying to do with new products is trying to introduce them more cost effectively also, but we measure that separately.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: One question. Just you sounded very bullish regarding the foundry FinFET ramp, but I'm wondering if you could give us your view on FinFET yield progress at the foundries and whether you think that there's some risk that yields might impact the ramp timing and overall 2015 demand outlook.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. Based on what we're hearing right now, I would not anticipate that, that's going to -- will impact the perspective on the foundry investment for next year. What we see today and what we're hearing from customers is continued strong investment in CapEx next year and more heavily weighted towards those next-generation technology nodes.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, good. And then just as a follow-up, I'm wondering if you could comment on demand in China and whether you're beginning to see visibility in the pipeline for new 300-millimeter fabs. And do you expect those -- that demand to pick up in 2015?
Robert J. Halliday: It's Bob. I think we see moderate amounts for that 300-millimeter local stuff. I think it's in there. We see it growing, but it's not a big number for us.
Gary E. Dickerson: I think our overall position in China is very good, but as Bob said, that the -- it's not a large driver for us next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Gary, first one, the CVB and etch share gains that you've mentioned to date, can you comment a little in terms of the customer segments that you've seen the most gains? And perhaps, more importantly, going forward, will there be additional incremental gains in both of those segments?
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks for the question. Relative to both of those different markets, the gains for us are weighted, I would say, a little bit more in terms of memory than it is in the other market segments. We have very strong growth, as I talked about earlier. The etch revenue we're forecasting for 2014 is up 2.5x where we were 2 years ago, so very significant growth in terms of etch. And as I had mentioned earlier also, the combined revenue growth for etch and CVD in calendar 2014 is around 50%, we believe, those areas will grow. And we made -- as Bob talked about earlier, we made a lot of investments in new products, and those new products are really helping drive the share gains in both of those different markets. We're very well positioned as our customers are transitioning to new technologies. Part of the gross margin pressure also that Bob talked about is really significant ramp. We talked about 300 chambers for new products that we announced at SEMICON West that we're shipping and really significant growth in those new products right now, which is great from a share standpoint, really positions us well around those technology transitions, providing some gross margin pressure as we're introducing these products to new customers. But overall, we're very optimistic about our outlook going forward in those markets.
Robert J. Halliday: Let me give you some more color if I could, Patrick. I was kind of joking with the guys around here that sometimes we're off on timing, but let's be right -- let's be on the -- we could be on the wrong side of timing once in a while, but let's be on the right side of inevitability. So if you look at the opportunity for us, it's really big on inflections. That's where you make penetration. So if you look at inflections, we've talked about flash storage [ph] around FinFETs, VNAND, very positive for us because that's where we push through the windows with those tools. So if you look at etch and CVD, we're making a lot good progress, gaining a lot in memory, in particular on inflections. And in fact, if the VNAND had been a little more robust this year, we might have gained up to another 0.5 point of WFE this year. So that means it wasn't quite as robust this year, but everybody says it's coming, right? Is it '15, '16? But kind of on the right side of the inflection, right? So -- and then within the specific question you asked about etch and CVD, etch is making great progress. Look at the numbers, up a lot, up in Q1. And the other thing is if you look at -- and memory is where the revenues are, but we're making good progress in qualification at more complicated places like foundries, too. So again, going back to timing and inevitability, if you get the penetrations, get the market share, get the products right, you can also get the gross margins right over time. So you want to be on the right side of the trends, the inflections, the inevitability of these things and then grind out cost and profitability stuff, and that's what we're doing.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Great, that's really helpful. And Bob, maybe specifically for you. You've obviously made improvements on the services business front, particularly on the operating margin line. Can you give a little more color in some of the specific tactics and moves that you guys have done that have helped drive the higher operating margins in that business group?
Robert J. Halliday: Well, it's not me. It's the SSG and AGS guys. I mean, AGS has worked really hard this year, and really, we're seeing some real progress. And they've work really collaboratively with SSG. I kind of think -- I'll go offline for a second. I kind of think we historically thought like equipment guys. We didn't think about the aftermarket, so we got much tighter alignment between the 2 groups this year. They shared bonus plans. They co-located. And you're starting to see real momentum with the teams. So I think getting people to work closely together, shared objectives, think about the service business has been a big plus. And I think they're just starting to turn the corner on that. I mean, you're starting to see the numbers. We saw it in the behavior, the tight relationships. So what are they tactically doing? They're doing some lower-cost sourcing. They're also doing some much more service contracts. You get sticky service revenues. So I think the strategy and execution in AGS and AGS working with SSG has been a big improvement on multiple fronts.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. I would tell you on the cost front, as Bob said, Patrick, we are really focused on trying to drive lower cost in our parts, in our -- and also the delivery of our service to our customers. So that will -- that is sustainable, and we really think that we're in the early phases of what we can do there. As Bob said, we've reorganized the service groups so that there's a tighter connection between the SSG business units with our service teams to really focus on, as we're ramping Epi for FinFET or the CVD products for deposition on a VNAND type of device, so the VNAND stack, these are tough processes. So to the extent that we can have service together with our business units and a tighter alignment, as customers are moving through these transitions, defects are harder. Uniformity is harder. Stability is harder, all of these different things. And certainly, they're very focused on cost. So that focus on value is really changed, and the alignment between the groups is much better. And we really believe that the growth that we're seeing there is sustainable into the future.
Robert J. Halliday: In terms of the -- let me give you a little more color. I think we made real good progress now. I think I can see it on the revenue and on the margin line. The margins did benefit a little bit in '14 from some onetime stuff I talked about earlier, but over time, we're systemically making more progress.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Gary and Bob, I was wondering if you -- there's been some more positive commentary lately on EUV. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any changes to your customer roadmaps in terms of potentially integrating EUV into the roadmap sooner.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. As of right now, we really don't see a major change in terms of impact on our business until kind of post 10 nanometer. So for us, I think over the next few years, we don't see a major impact.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Okay. And Bob, a quick question on the OpEx and maybe earnings leverage. How should we expect OpEx to trend over the next few quarters? And also, the EPS has been sort of in this $0.25 to $0.29 range for the past few quarters. When can we expect sort of better earnings leverage? Is it just from sort of the buybacks? Or should we expect other things to drive the EPS leverage as we look forward?
Robert J. Halliday: Sure. So on the OpEx, I'll say what I said at the beginning -- almost exactly a year ago this time. We tend to have a little bit of OpEx pressure early in the year because we give everybody a raise on the same date in early January. So we got about almost a month of that in this quarter, and then we have 3 months of it in the following quarter. And we do have the benefit of the shutdown in this quarter, and we're not planning it on into the second quarter. So there's a little bit of OpEx increased pressures typically for us in Q2. So we have to manage that. But I feel like there's a little bit upward pressure there, and we have to manage it to get within a tolerable range. The other thing is we have a lot of new products coming out, so that's driving the top line growth. In fact, give you more color on that, we think there's an excellent chance that we're going to gain -- grow revenue in every one of our segments last -- next year in '15. But we really have a lot of new products coming out. We have the R&D pipe, and even in AGS, there's some investments in revenue growth. So what's the point? I think expenses have a little bit upward pressure through the year. Part of it's the raises. Part of it's the number of new products coming out. So we have to work on that. In terms of the operating margins, EPS, as you start to get these products, and if you're in a decent WFE environment and we're making progress on the lines below that, including tax, we're starting to knock on the door, getting those higher numbers in terms of EPS.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: A question on your order -- segment orders. Your -- that looks a little different than what your peers have reported in general, foundry orders down significantly and DRAM up pretty significantly. Is there something different about your order pattern? Or it's just the 1-month offset that is causing that variation with the peers?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, I would say that there's a couple of thoughts there. I think the 1-month thing throws it a little bit. The other thing is -- some of it -- even within our products, some of them have a little bit different phased purchase. For instance, our Epi tools at foundries tend to be about -- earlier in the cycle than later. So you got to go through all the mix. I don't think there's real fundamental difference in what we're seeing.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And a question on AGS. You had the revenue -- if I look at the calendar year or January quarter, January quarter revenue will be probably up close to 10% on AGS, about 22 50 [ph]. Where do you see that run rate? How should we look at AGS run rate over next couple of years?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes. Our goal is to grow that 6% to 8% type of numbers, which is in our strategic plan we gave you a couple of years ago. And we're starting to see that. The services were strong in the past quarter or 2. We're putting a little bit more money into the OpEx line to invest in some basically product type stuff in AGS. So sort of 68% is what our goal is.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: So first a clarification. Why is it that etch is growing so much faster than your other products in the first quarter? Is this simply just share gains off of a smaller base? Or is there more to it?
Robert J. Halliday: We think a couple of things going on. If you look at it, we believe we gained share on the year in '14. We gained share on the year in '13, and we're optimistic we'll gain share on the year in '15. Secondly, if you look at some of the timing of some of the places where we're gaining share, we talked about memory looking good for us, and it's a pretty good early part of the year for memory. Everybody's talking about places like DRAM and some NAND. So I think it's a trend over years, and then in the quarter, it's strong also, but it's probably ongoing trend.
Gary E. Dickerson: And also, it's the -- I think in the etch case, as we talked about earlier, we have some new products that have very strong pull from customers. So as those products are ramping, that also gives us a tailwind.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then you talked about '15 being another very strong year for the foundries. Are you going to see a broadening of your customer base, the number of players participating in the foundries in '15, do you believe, over '14? And if so, what kind of impact would that have on your overall share in the space?
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, foundry is a really strong position for us. We have many of the transistor and interconnect-enabling technologies. That's really driving our Epi, our metal deposition, implants, some of the areas that we talked about earlier that were extremely strong. So foundry spending is really very good for us. We have very good share in really all of the different foundries, so there's not a tremendous difference from one to the next. We do see some broadening relative to the investment in 2015, but the key thing for us, and as we've talked about before, especially in FinFET, as FinFET ramps, our total available market opportunity goes up 25% to 35%. And those are the areas where we have many leadership products. So that is very, very good for us from a growth perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So first question on -- just clarification on the commentary about higher memory spending in 2015. Is it mostly driven by DRAM growth that you talked about and less so from NAND? And is that more to do with just, call it, timing of the 3D NAND spending more like in terms [indiscernible] ? I'm just trying to understand if there's more DRAM, less NAND. Or is it pretty balanced for you in 2 buckets?
Gary E. Dickerson: I think, Edwin, it's pretty balanced based on what we see today and what we're hearing from customers. In both cases, we see memory spending up next year. As I said earlier, the 3D NAND transition is happening slower than we anticipated, so we see incremental investment in planar NAND. 3D NAND is broadening and is increasing in 2015, but we see both the NAND and DRAM investment up in 2015.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: And then just kind of going back to etch. I'm trying to understand how much of that is just TAM expansion. It sounds like there's always a little bit more option maybe [ph] there? And I think you mentioned that at least initially, you guys have stronger position in memory, which helped you in etch. I'm thinking your product is -- have higher productivity than your competitor and that is one differentiation. Is that a big driver for customer to adopt that? And is that because -- because, I think, historically, memory customers tend to be more cautious there. Is that -- is productivity a big issue the customer is facing and you guys are able to win on that?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. I think, productivity -- overall cost of ownership is a big focus for everybody with more patterning steps. That's certainly a big focus. We actually have in the new products some very strong technology. If you look at areas like microloading, for instance, we've -- we have some very good capability there. CD uniformity is always a big issue for our customers. So we are seeing, not only on the cost of ownership side but also on the technology side, some really good opportunities for us to grow the business. We've strengthened that team a tremendous amount. It's really an outstanding group, tremendous passion in solving problems for customers -- high-value problems for customers. And as Bob talked about, we've increased investment there, both in R&D for the new products that are ramping now and in the field technical support. So we see very good pull. Certainly, in memory, we are gaining in logic, and we see pull on cost but also on the technology side.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, everyone, for your question, and we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings press release and in our reconciliation slides, which are available on the Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. In our third fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered earnings near the high end of our guidance. We are demonstrating substantial progress toward our long-term financial model, having now improved operating margins for 7 quarters in a row. During the same period, we have stepped up our investment in research and development to create a pipeline of new product that will enable our customers' future success and drive long-term growth for Applied. We are in the middle of the biggest changes in semiconductor and display technologies in decades, and these major technology transitions are enabled by materials innovation. This plays directly to Applied's unique capability in precision materials engineering. Our strong operating and financial performance is supported by sustained investment in capacity and new technology by our customers. Across the company, we are building momentum for profitable growth. We have focused our strategy and investment in areas that have the largest impact for customers and generate the best returns for Applied. We are driving execution of our strategic plan by focusing on alignment and speed. And we are placing a significant emphasis on getting the organization ready to scale by ensuring that we have the right talent in the right areas. The actions we are taking benefit us today and pave the way for rapid integration with Tokyo Electron. The merger with TEL accelerates our existing strategy by bringing together both companies' complementary strengths to create an expanded set of capabilities. This will enable us to be a higher value partner for customers by delivering more innovative products faster and at lower cost. We are engaged in dialogues with regulators around the world, consistent with our goal of closing the merger before the end of the calendar year. During this phase, we have been advised not to provide details or answer questions about ongoing discussion. Turning to our market outlook. Mobility and connectivity trends continue to drive significant growth and accelerate technology innovation in both semiconductor and display. In foundry, the broadening of spending this year and the build-out of the 28- and 20-nanometer nodes is fueling record performance for our transistor businesses. The next major focus for foundries is FinFET, and we believe this will provide a catalyst for a new wave of investment in 2015, as customers start to ramp this technology. In memory, overall investment levels remained strong. NAND bit growth is expected to be around 40% this year. While the bulk of this incremental demand will be met by investments in advanced planar technology, customers are now publicly discussing their road map for 3D NAND to achieve cost parity with planar NAND. Based on what customers are telling us about their future investment, we believe the bit scaling advantages of 3D NAND, combined with performance improvement, will fuel 3D NAND spending in 2015 and beyond as more manufacturers move to this new technology. As we have said before, this transition to 3D materials-enabled devices is very positive for Applied, expanding our available market by 35% to 50%. In DRAM, we see supply tightening. Lower-power mobile DRAM shipments are expected to grow about 60% this year. And in parallel, there are indications that an enterprise-driven PC refresh cycle is underway. As a result, DRAM investment is increasing. We expect technology conversion to provide the 30% bit growth needed this year while seeing strong potential for new capacity additions in 2015. We anticipate overall memory spending being up approximately 30% in calendar 2014. And in addition, we believe we will grow our share with memory customers by more than 2 points this year. Looking at the market as a whole, we maintain our view that 2014 wafer fab equipment spending could be up 10% to 20% this year. We also believe that 2015 will be stronger than 2014, as the foundries ramp FinFET, more customers invest in 3D NAND and DRAM spending increases. In Display, 2014 is shaping up largely as expected, with strong investment in capacity and new technology. This is being driven by mobility, where higher resolution displays are becoming a major battleground for smartphones and tablet and TV, where average screen sizes are growing significantly faster than historic norms. In the past 2 quarters, we booked over $600 million of display orders, which is over $100 million higher than we expected at the start of Q2. In semiconductor and display, the major device technology changes that are taking place are enabled by materials innovation, and this provides a great opportunity for us. Over the past 18 months, we have aligned the company around our precision materials engineering strategy to drive growth at Applied Materials. Central to this strategy is the rapid development of enabling product, and we are very pleased with how our current portfolio and future pipeline are taking shape. This quarter, our metal deposition product business delivered its highest revenue in 14 years. Epi, one of Applied's first products, posted its highest sales for any 12-month period in our history. Epi remains a key enabler for next-generation transistors, and we believe the applications for Epi technology will grow significantly in the future. We are gaining share in both etch and CVD and expect our combined revenue in these markets to grow by approximately 40% in calendar 2014. We are also building traction with our selective material removal technology and now have tools at 5 large customers. Across the company, we are driving actions that allow us to move faster and scale the organization. We are strengthening our teams and processes in the field, product development and operation. This is enabling us to see inflections first and deliver solutions to our customers faster. We are in the process of making changes to our structure to better align the field, R&D, service and operation while getting ready for our combination with Tokyo Electron. To drive repeatable success, we have trained over 3,500 engineers and technologists across the company while investing in the development of our general managers and marketing capability. As technology transitions get harder for our customers, we are seeing strong pull for our service business. We have made significant changes in our service organization to deliver better device performance and yield, as well as more competitive cost for our customers as they ramp complex, new device technology. By building our capabilities in areas that help customers ramp new technologies faster and at lower cost, we anticipate AGS will deliver high single-digit revenue growth this year. As Bob will explain in a few minutes, we are converting our focus on alignment, speed and scaling into superior financial performance. The progress we are making towards our 2016 financial model is driven by strong demand for our most enabling products in transistor and interconnect; improving performance in our businesses that are growing the most, including etch, CVD and display; and actions we have taken to limit our exposure to the downturn in the solar market. To summarize, Applied has great opportunities, as we are uniquely positioned to apply our differentiated capabilities in precision materials engineering to enable major technology transition. We are only at the beginning of these inflections. The ramps in FinFET, 3D NAND and new display technology will be the next of multiple waves of investment by our customers. We remain highly focused on execution to ensure that we can take full advantage of these opportunities and can rapidly scale the organization when we merge with Tokyo Electron. Our teams around the company have already accomplished a great deal. The progress we are making towards our strategic and financial goals would not be possible without the hard work and passion of our global employees. Now, Bob will provide additional details on our performance and outlook.
Robert J. Halliday: Thanks, Gary. As Gary discussed, we have aligned the company around a growth strategy that is creating a pipeline of differentiated products to enable our customers' success as they make unprecedented technology transition. Before I get into the detail of our third quarter results, I'll spend a few minutes talking about our focus on execution and how this is translating and will continue to translate in stronger financial [indiscernible]. Let me provide some details about how we are executing better and faster in key areas [ph], how we are making sustainable improvements in our operating model and how these improvements are translating into stronger financial results. Here are a few examples of better, faster execution across the company. In SSG, market share gains are being helped by a significant reduction in our product development cycles. In AGS, we are driving profitability improvement with the introduction of new device performance and field service products and tighter alignment with SSG. In Display, we reduced our factory overhead costs and inflation cycle time. In EES, we expect to be above breakeven and cash flow-positive [indiscernible] the year. And for the company as a whole, we have been reducing our tax rates for the implementation of a more efficient tax structure [indiscernible]. Now let me give you some examples of the sustainable improvements we are making in our operating [indiscernible]. We have increased resource allocation to SSG and display, areas where we have superior opportunities to grow revenues and margin. Within SSG, we have increased our focus on the products that are most enabling to customers [ph] and where we have great opportunity to grow. These areas include Epi, CVD, etch, inspection and PVD. And we are relentlessly focused on reducing materials and overhead [indiscernible]. For the year, we're on target to achieve a 2% reduction in material [indiscernible]. Our strong execution is translating into improved financial [indiscernible]. On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 gross margin was at a 6-year high, and our full year gross margin will be up 2 points, approaching 44%. Q3 operating margin was at a 3-year high. The full year results could be up by 6 points. The fiscal year tax rate could be down by 1 point or more and is making progress towards our 22% target. And operating cash flow was at a 3-year high. Our focus on execution, alignment and speed is translating into stronger financial results today, enabling us to make solid progress toward our long-term model and getting the organization ready for our combination with Tokyo Electron. Now I will provide more color on our third quarter results as compared to the prior quarter. Orders of $2.5 billion were down 6% sequentially, driven by SSG orders, which tend to be seasonally slower this time of year [ph]. Compared to the third quarter of last year, orders were up 24%. And our book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1 for the seventh consecutive quarter. Backlog was almost $3 billion, with SSG backlog at a new 6-year high and Display backlog at a 5-year high. Net sales of $2.3 billion were near the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin increased to 45.5% in Q3, which included 0.8 points in non-recurring benefits. Even excluding these benefits, gross margin improved by 1 point [ph] [indiscernible]. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 was near the high end of our guidance. Our operating cash flow was $584 million or 26% of revenue. Next, I'll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.6 billion were down 6%, with decreases in DRAM and foundry, more than offsetting small increases [ph] [indiscernible]. SSG net sales of $1.5 billion were down 7%, slightly below our expectation due to some changes in the timing of customer fab. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin increased 1.4 points to 28.7%, reflecting favorable mix. SSG's operating margin performance was at the highest level in almost [indiscernible] years. AGS orders of $552 million were up 3% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. AGS net sales of $567 million were slightly higher than expected, an increase of 14% [indiscernible]. AGS non-GAAP operating margin decreased slightly to 27.2% and remained near the highest level in 7 years [ph]. Display orders of $296 million were the second-highest in the past 6 years [ph]. Display net sales of $119 million declined, in line with our expectation. While backlog grew at very high levels, in anticipation [indiscernible]. Display non-GAAP operating margin increased by over 4 points to 22%, including a benefit from the sale of some previously reserved [indiscernible]. Display's operating margin was the highest in the past 3 years [ph]. EES orders were $66 million. Net sales increased to $103 million. EES non-GAAP operating income was $25 million, including the benefit of favorable litigation outcome. Now I will provide our fourth quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat, plus or minus 3%. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be down 1% to 7%. AGS net sales were flat to up 4% [ph]. We expect display net sales to be up over 60%, and EES net sales should be down approximately 35%. Non-GAAP gross margin should be approximately 44%, which would be up almost 2 points year-over-year. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million, plus or minus [indiscernible]. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 25% to [indiscernible]. In summary, our strong financial performance and the progress we are making towards our long-term model is being supported by sustained investment by our semiconductor and display customers; our precision materials engineering strategy, which is focused on enabling major technology transitions for our customers [ph]; and our focus on improving execution, alignment and speed. With that, let me turn the call back over to Mike Sullivan for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Bob. [Operator Instructions]
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of them. There's a couple of new DRAM fabs that are being built out, and, of course, there's a much discussed build-out from one of the other foundries, who's trying to play a little bit of catch-up on FinFET. Could you guys give us a little bit of perspective on the timing for new orders for those projects? I know, in particular, on the foundry project, different equipment suppliers have seen those orders at different times. So I'm wondering how much of that is still on the come versus how much of that you might have already seen, and then same thing on the DRAM side.
Robert J. Halliday: Sure. The big drivers of the technology transitions we talked about earlier [ph] [indiscernible] FinFET and VNAND. And if you look at FinFET, still very positive. I think it's a little more heavily weighted to early '15 and late '15 [ph]. If you look at VNAND, some of that has been slipping from [indiscernible]. DRAM was [indiscernible].
James V. Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. And then if I could follow up. You guys have done a terrific job on the gross margins. I think that you had commented at SEMICON that it was the highest gross margin -- quarterly gross margin in 6 years, then you guys did another nice bump-up this quarter. What are the biggest incremental drivers of gross margin from here? Is it just volume, mix or lower component costs? Or how would you categorize the bridge between where you are today and wherever you might be able to go? Because it's been very impressive so far.
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, there's 2 sets of opportunities, Jim. The one that is most disruptive and sexy and attractive is interesting new disruptive products that are really valuable for [ph] customers. And those, frankly, are starting to come, especially next year, we'll see more of that. The progress we made to date is just managing very tightly [ph]. If you look at our gross margins across virtually every segment of AGS, solar, Display and Semitool [ph]. So it's blocking and tackling, reducing operating costs, reducing the build costs, better mix -- driving better mix in terms of your revenue and sales, better mix between segments. So I think these systemic things, just grinding away at mix, cost issues, positioning and betting on the right products is going to help us quarter in, quarter out for the next several years. I think the disruptive new product is coming out more next year. So we see 2 opportunities there, one is pretty systemic and one is [indiscernible].
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, what I would say also, Jim, is that the -- as we've talked about, these transitions are really in the sweet spot for us, with all of the precision materials, engineering, technologies and products that we have. And, really, the customer pull is stronger than we've ever seen. Our percent of the TAM increases as some of these materials-enabled devices start to ramp. So as Bob said, that's the key strategic issue for our customers, and that's really what gives us a great opportunity to grow our business over the next few quarters and over the next few years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from ISI Group.
Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, first question, I was hoping to get an update on integration efforts with TEL. You provided some great info at SEMICON and prior to that; would love to get an update there.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. On the -- thanks for the question, C.J. On the merger, we're absolutely convinced that this is the right strategy to bring more value for our customers, drive innovation with better products, faster and lower cost. And I think as we continue to work together, we're more and more convinced of that. And that really is accelerating our existing strategy in materials innovation and really focused on the key challenges, the key strategic challenges that our customers have. So that's been going very well. The integration planning has really been tremendous. We talked, as you said, last month a lot about that relative to the organizational structure. We're aligned on the culture and the mission, vision and values, the operating rhythm. And what I've seen is just a continual building of those relationships and excitement of all the key people on both sides. So really just tremendous progress ahead of where we thought we would be at this point.
Robert J. Halliday: I agree with Gary. I think the mechanics of the integration, which seemed to be your question, C.J., is going actually really well, better than I would have expected. The engagement by the teams has been really good. Working relationships have been strong. Sort of the rhythm of it in terms of operating organization, how we'll do business together has been pretty darn positive. I think we see line of sight to the synergies. Pretty damn good, I'd say.
Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: That's great. And if I could ask a follow-up. It looks like revenues came to the low end of the range, and the culprit was silicon. And at the same time, your backlog actually grew there, I think, 4%. So curious, how should we think about the time frame of recognizing revenues there? And does that suggest a strong January quarter and/or does that kind of bleed into the first half of '15?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, we do have a really strong backlog, actually, in SSG and Display. We've been talking about the display backlog and the orders build for a couple of quarters. We're going to start to get some significant benefit for the Display backlog in terms of the revenue line next quarter. SSG backlog will help us next quarter, but I think some of that benefit will also go into fiscal [indiscernible].
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Farhan asking a question on behalf of John. My first question is regarding the breakup of orders within SSG. Did you provide a breakup between NAND, DRAM, foundry and logic? I may have missed it on your commentary.
Robert J. Halliday: We didn't provide.
Michael Sullivan: Yes, it's in the press release, Farhan, so we can definitely point it out to you later and...
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: No, that's fine.
Michael Sullivan: Okay.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then in regards to 2015 expectation, you talked about a significant ramp in 3D, and also, on DRAM side, you're persisting that there could be a pickup as the capacity additions may possibly resume. From -- in terms of your outlook for 2015, which segments do you expect to grow most? If you could just give us a sense of is there strength more in foundry or is it more in memory?
Gary E. Dickerson: So first of all, 2015, we think will be an up year, as we talked about before. Kind of the major changes that are happening in '15, we see that the investment in FinFET technologies are going to pick up a fair amount. Should be -- our current forecast is something like 50% of the foundry business we'll be investing for those technologies in 2015. And we see foundry investment may be up slightly in 2015. The memory business for both NAND flash and DRAM, we see both of those being up. And also, as we talked about before, we see 3D NAND investment in '15 increasing significantly from where we're at in 2014. So those are the major drivers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: A couple of things. Bob, I wanted to ask about the performance of the company this calendar year versus what your financial model is. And I understand that the financial model is a 2016 model, so maybe the answer is just time. But this year, you're going to do with like -- WFE is sort of in the low-30s, maybe it's $32 billion, I think, is what you guys are now saying. You're going to do somewhere in the $1.10 range, if you assume that the January quarter is not like heroically up or down. And your financial model has you doing $1.50 at $30 billion WFE. So my question is, what is going to happen or sort of what has to happen to get from where you are this year to where the financial model says you'll be? Because there still seems to be a big gap.
Robert J. Halliday: I've got to check the math. I didn't know if it's $1.50 at $30 billion, frankly. This year, it's about a $31.6 billion to $31.9 billion WFE. So if you look at -- we got a gain [ph]. We said in the model we're going to get to 19.9% wafer fab equipment in SSG. We ended last year at 19.1%. We haven't forecasted it this year. But the year before, it's 17.7%; we gained [ph] 1.4% through last year in wafer fab equipment. We continue to be optimistic that we'll get to the 19.9% [indiscernible] model. The second thing is gross margins. I think at the $30 billion model, we were at like 44%, 45%. In the quarter just ended, we did 45.5%. This year, we'll probably be about 44%. So it's a little higher volume, $31.6 billion versus the $30 billion model. So we're actually getting there. OpEx, I think, in the $30 billion -- I'm doing this from memory, Tim. I think it was like a 2 2 [ph] or something like that.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: 2 1 [ph].
Robert J. Halliday: 2 1 [ph]. So right now, we're trending to be about 220 [ph] on the year so we did about $100 million [ph] extra expense. Just a little 450 [ph] spend in our numbers and then we've got some managed expenses and inflation a little bit, so we're off [ph] about 100 [ph]. Tax rate, we said, would be 22% in that model. And right now, we're running a full year, I think we're going to end up around 23, 24 [indiscernible]. So -- and I feel pretty good about the 22% getting there. So if you look at -- I think we're about 70% on track. [indiscernible] we've got to get a little more share gain, a little more gross margin, manage down expenses a little bit [indiscernible]. Let me just check the math. I guess we are [indiscernible], but those are the levers, I think about 65%, 70% there. Yes, you're right, it is $1.50[ph].
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Awesome. Okay. And then just a follow-up on the fourth calendar quarter. If you look at the numbers that Semi puts out, the run rate for Q1 with WFE was like $34 billion, $33 billion, $34 billion. Q2 is like $30 billion. And then most companies, including you guys, are sort of guiding Q3 down just a touch. So maybe you're sort of in the $30 billion range. So if the full year is going to be $32 billion, then the fourth quarter has to be a pretty good quarter to get you to $32 billion for the year. Is that what you see right now, that the fourth quarter is going to be up pretty sizably in SSG?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, we haven't guided to a Q1 yet, but we think Q1 is probably stronger, fiscal Q1 for us, right, which is November, December. It's been that way pretty often in recent past. And if you think about -- we talked about earlier, Tim, about technology transitions, VNAND and FinFET. They slipped down [ph] a little bit on the -- in the middle of this year, but they still look very committed to those. So my guess is that the fiscal Q1 for us or the calendar Q4 for the industry is probably [indiscernible].
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Given the complexities, both process development and yield ramps associated with some of these next-generation technologies, it looks like your take rate and attach rates on services is growing nicely. I think you guys said you anticipate high single-digits percentage growth this year. Given what appears to be a continuation of this complexity trend, would you expect similar type of growth going forward? And at this type of growth rate, are you guys driving OpEx leverage?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. So we definitely see opportunities in the service business. As customers are going through dramatic technology transitions in foundry and in memory, it really creates a great opportunity for us. We've done a lot in terms of aligning our service strategy to those opportunities. We've changed the organization structure. So there's tighter alignment between SSG and AGS. So we're really focused on those device performance and yield and cost challenges. As customers are making those transitions, we're seeing good response from customers, so strong pull for those types of capabilities. As customers are making these transitions, getting the particles to the level they need to be to get good yield, edge die yield, uniformity, all of these things are harder and harder. And we're aligning our company and our strategy and our structure to really provide more value for our customers and drive those opportunities. So we see, as we said, the single-digit revenue growth this year. So we really see this, as you talked about, as a great opportunity for us to continue to drive the service business going forward. And there -- we see a lot of leverage also as that business grows.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then on the selective removal platform, I think at SEMICON, you pegged this as about a $1 billion opportunity. You talked about tools being placed with 5 large customers. What technology nodes are your early customers looking to use this solution in high-volume manufacturing? And is it more targeted for front-end-focused or back-end-focused applications?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, thanks, Harlan. So we've always seen some cases where customers are putting the selective removal technology into production, but we really see this more as you go forward to some of these future device technologies. Especially, we've seen adoption of this in memory. And there are a number of different potential opportunities in patterning. You have things like pattern collapse. As you're going vertical to the taller 3D types of structures with the tighter design rules, that's where you start seeing the current technologies running out of gas and an opportunity for us to implement the selective removal technology. So we do see some already, layers going into production with this technology. Certainly, we'll see it ramping next year, and then probably the year after that, even stronger adoption.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Yes, the spending environment has been under a little bit of pressure recently, but we're seeing what I think is just a higher level of stability in your revenues compared to some of your peers. And I'd love your perspective on that. Is that just seasonal or do you guys see your businesses inherently being less cyclical?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, I think, generally, the semi industry is a little less cyclical, a little more seasonal, as you go to more and more consumer products for the chip versus [indiscernible]. So I think that's true, and I think a lot of people believe that. I think the Display business, half of it or 60% of it is kind of cyclical big TV size, more TV capacity added. I think there's a little bit more systemic growth on the smaller screen sizes, phones, iPads, things like that. So net-net, between Semi and Display, I think we're trending more seasonal versus cyclical, historically. And the other thing that's going pretty well for us: the service business looks like it's going to get [ph] some growth. And also the solar business, the growth is moderate, but the profitability is [indiscernible].
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: And your SSG revenues were a little bit lighter, but margins were a lot better. Bob, you mentioned mix. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on what was it within the mix that drove the better margins there.
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, a couple things. One, I think -- the revenues, I was actually, in hindsight, in SSG, relatively pleased. We had strong bookings. Revenues were a little under what we thought, but there were things that transpired in the quarter that happened there that we managed it pretty well. And then if you look at our peers, our guide and our actuals sort of our second quarter, our third quarter and even our third quarter through our fiscal fourth quarter, we compare pretty well, actually. So the revenues in SSG and the company are holding up okay. If you look within SSG revenue mix model, which you're asking on the margin, we're making some progress in most of the products and some margin, cost reduction, efficiency, selling more upgrade products. It's all of the execution things you think about every day. So the gross margins are trending up a little bit. Now what we're very optimistic about is the money we've invested last year, last couple of years, really, in R&D and SSG because we put a heavy weighting of that this year on 300-millimeter products versus 450 last year. We think those are going to give us some more lift on opportunities in the revenue and gross margin line of product [ph].
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: The first one I have was for Gary. If you look at the 3 big technology inflations next year, 3D NAND, FinFET and multi-patterning DRAM, in your WFE assumption, which do you think is -- in terms of dollars, which do you think is going to be the biggest? Do you think 3D NAND or FinFET?
Gary E. Dickerson: In terms of dollars, the FinFET -- or the foundry spending is going to be higher than 3D NAND. And what we see in both the FinFET and 3D NAND is a real strong transition to both the FinFET as a percentage of that spending and also 3D NAND as a percentage of the NAND flash spending. So in both cases, we think that the spending for those new technologies are going to be around 50%. And as we've said before, that's very positive for us because we have great products in enabling new transistor technologies. And 3D NAND is really materials-enabled versus litho-enabled. So it's very heavy in areas where we have a very strong position. So in both cases, we see about half of the spending next year being those new technologies. Foundry is about 2x the total spending versus 3D NAND. So that would mean that the FinFET is more heavily a percentage of our revenue versus 3D NAND.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared comments about capacity additions in DRAM next year, despite just technology changes this year. So next year, when you look at capacity additions, can you try to quantify or help us quantify, in terms of wafer starts or [indiscernible], what do you expect for DRAM capacity has to be in calendar '15?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, what we see in DRAM next year is up some versus 2014. But if you look at '13 to '14, the WFE spending really is going up pretty dramatically. We have it up in the 30% to 45% range in terms of total WFE spending in DRAM. And we see it up slightly, maybe less than 5% next year, is our current view. And on the capacity versus technology, we see it much heavier-weighted in capacity buys versus technology buys in 2015, but that's our current view.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on the segment operating margin. Maybe to start with, if, Bob, you can maybe share some color on the rising of unallocated corporate expenses. Is that mostly due to merger with Tokyo Electron? And does that go away after the merger is completed? So maybe there's room for additional operating margin improvement from that corporate line?
Robert J. Halliday: So if you look at GAAP versus non-GAAP, we have a couple of points spread between our GAAP and non-GAAP PVD [ph], the tax income. It's actually -- generally, the spend just gets tighter, but there's about -- most of that is the Tokyo Electron. And then we also have this corporate sometimes under the bonus plans. I think a lot of that you're looking at is a non-GAAP related to [indiscernible] merger costs [ph].
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up question on the improving gross margin. How much are gross margins benefiting from this diversification of spending by the customer base, especially in foundry? The question is, can gross margin possibly see another tailwind as customers not named Intel or GSMC or Samsung memory become a biggest piece of your sales?
Robert J. Halliday: Let me go back to give you the answer I gave before and then give you more color first [ph], Stephen. What we've done to date is we've done a lot of good blocking and tackling with places like EES, where we have -- get the cost down, get -- run it back at a rate in business and raise gross margin [ph] that contribute to the company. If you look at display, it reduced their overhead costs and getting valuable products. The whole mix of things have done well. If you look at AGS, trended up a little bit with gross margins there, too. So it's all of the blocking and tackling across the company. So you can't pick a heroic thing, you just look at good blocking-and-tackling and execution and a broad range of activities. Within SSG, specifically, where you're talking about, there's things -- blocking and tackling probably helped us some. The second thing that helps and hurts periodically in the quarter is just mix of the individual products. So we're actually gaining share in etch, which we talked and we're very pleased with. But the gross margins are a little bit lower in these early etch tools. And it's not pricing, it's just etch is always a little bit lower for us the last 20 years. So the mix within quarters, once [indiscernible], the systemic thing in SSG, the blocking and tackling is getting better, new products are coming, which will help SSG, you have timing mix quarter-to-quarter, which is a plus or minus. Now the question you're asking is mix between customers. We don't typically talk about mix between customers. Configurations are different, the mix of product sales is different. But generally, we think we're in line to sell a more valuable set of product volumes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sundeep Bajikar from Jefferies.
Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Would you please provide your perspective on Applied's Display business in China? What's your outlook for new investments in display technology from China over the next year? And how would you characterize the competitive landscape over there for display equipment? As part of that, perhaps also help us understand if there are any major synergies between Applied's Display business and Semiconductor business in China.
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Sundeep. The business in China for display is definitely very strong. And as we've talked about before, our customers are going through transitions in amorphous silicon, to LTPS, to metal oxide and organic LED types of display technologies. Our market share performance in display is really exceeding our expectations. We have very strong products, as customers are ramping these new factories and ramping these new technologies. So we're -- China is a big percentage of our business right now. I think we recently announced an order where we had 100% market share in one of the big factories there. So overall, we're very, very optimistic about display. We talked also about the last 2 quarters having more than $600 million in orders. So the overall momentum there is very good. And as Bob talked about, the team is really outstanding. They're executing really well in terms of their new product introduction. They've cut their install cycle times down dramatically. A lot of different things they're doing there not only from an innovation standpoint but also from an execution standpoint.
Sundeep Bajikar - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Great. That's very helpful. And just to follow up, how much exposure does Applied have to flexible OLED display? If we see a product in technology ramp in flexible display, say, in the next 6 to 12 months, is there a chance we would see it impacting Applied's fundamentals?
Gary E. Dickerson: We do have products. So OLED, with the current displays, the TAM opportunity for us goes up by about a factor of 2. And -- so that's a very good opportunity for us with existing technologies. We also have some new technologies that we are seeing traction with some of these flexible products that are being -- the early ones that are being adopted by customers. And we have opportunities there with new business. We're seeing the early indications of that, but we definitely do have opportunities there also.
Robert J. Halliday: I think, Gary, now when it also grows our addressable market [indiscernible].
Gary E. Dickerson: Absolutely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Maybe first question, in terms of the share gains you guys have generated over the past year or so, as we look at 2014 versus 2015, as FinFET and 3D NAND ramp even higher next year, how much of the share gains will we, I guess, see realized in 2015, given that, Bob, I think you mentioned some of the new products that are out there? How much more will we see that impact hit the company's, I guess, top and bottom line in 2015?
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, we think a few things play for us in 2015, Patrick. One, we think we could gain share. The addressable market for those products was growing fast, and we think we'll gain share. And those markets tend to be around CVD. Etch, we think, will do well. Some CMP steps are being added, I believe, in one of those structures. So it looks pretty good for us. The second thing, so mix of customer spending should play for us for those things, number one. Number two, some of our tools that we're offering in there will play for us. And then, three, within the mix of that customer spending, it's more -- first point of mix was between customer. Second was in the type of products they're buying. 3D NAND and FinFET is more heavily weighted than where we're gaining share. So I think all of those will play first usefully [ph] on the market share opportunities in [indiscernible].
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Great. And maybe a specific question for you, Bob. Looking at the last several quarters, you guys have done a really good job in terms of, it looks like inventory, as well as DSOs and the supply chain. If you could give some of the examples of what you've done on those fronts to improve the balance sheet metrics, as well as cash flow generation.
Robert J. Halliday: Yes, some of the stuff isn't glamorous. I think the whole company's done a good job. I mean, if you think of some of the stuff we pulled onetime today, whether it's the display tools we [indiscernible] the money on, the inventory we pulled in solar, EES, the -- some of the stuff in the customs audit in Korea, there's just a lot of good blocking and tackling across a wide range of people in the company, and it feels like it's building momentum. That's a good thing. In terms of higher-level principles, we are taking more strategic view of the supply chain, I think, in terms of the ramp, IP, costs and sourcing opportunities. I think we're starting to subsegment our supply base into people who have high IP versus low-cost opportunity. I think we're tackling that a little bit [indiscernible]. I think if you look at our new products, as we're going to ship new products, we're taking a deeper view of the IP opportunities in those new products. We have sustainable differentiation ourselves. And then we'll probably take a more strategic view of it. That's still developing. We get better and better. In terms of the balance sheet, [indiscernible]. I think we're doing better. I think it's a big [indiscernible] opportunity, to be honest. But I think inventory, how we manage inventory in the factory and service, we made some progress. I think we're going to continue to make [indiscernible].
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on the flat panel display again. You had pretty high level of orders. I think you have to go back to 2008 to get to those levels. And historically, those have been very lumpy. Can you give us a sense of what the yearly run rate are you thinking right now, this year and next year, in 600 to 700 kind of range? Or some help on that will be very good.
Gary E. Dickerson: What we talked about in our financial model was to get to $1 billion run rate in the 2016 model. And we feel really good about the progress we're making. We also talked about, as these new technologies are introduced, the LTPS, metal oxide, organic LED, some of these flexible substrates, all of those are great for us from a TAM growth perspective. In some cases, as much as 2x larger TAM versus where we're at today. So the market, we have really good pull relative to the total available market. And also, our market share is growing pretty significantly in the Display business. So we're very optimistic. From a model standpoint, we're still on track with what we've talked about in the 2016 model. Around $1 billion is the -- is that goal.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then one question on SSG. You talked a little bit about the memory growing 30% this year and maybe DRAM growing 5% this year. So is it fair to say that this year's growth primarily coming from memory and next year growth maybe more driven by foundry?
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, so if you look at the wafer fab equipment spending in 2014, we're still -- we still have the view that it's up 10% to 20% versus 2013. The areas that are growing are foundry, the NAND flash and also DRAM. All of those areas are up a fair amount. In the foundry case, it's more a broadening of the customers that are spending. But all of those are up a fair amount. And our current view, based on what we're hearing from customers, is that 2015 is going to be a stronger year than 2014. We see still strong spending in the foundries in 2014 and incremental improvement in the memory business. But within that, you also have, as we talked about, major technology transitions that are happening in the foundry and in NAND flash that are very positive for us.
Robert J. Halliday: So, Mahesh, we're still guessing [indiscernible]. But I guess, in my opinion, as Gary said, they're all up. Probably the biggest percentage growth of those 3 is probably NAND.
Michael Sullivan: All right, Mahesh, thanks for your question. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

We will provide you with more details as we get closer to the event. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. In our second fiscal quarter of 2014, Applied Materials delivered earnings near the high end of our guidance and we expanded our operating margins for the sixth quarter in a row. These results reflect healthy investment by our semiconductor and display customers, strong execution against our strategic plans and significant improvements in our financial performance. Across the company, we are focused on accelerating our momentum for profitable growth. We are strengthening our field technical engagements with customers, our R&D capabilities, and our ability to ramp new products faster with lower cost and better quality. At the same time, we are making great progress getting the organization ready for our merger with Tokyo Electron. We continue to believe that we will receive regulatory approval for the merger in the second half of this year. Our S-4 securities registration statement has become effective and our shareholder meeting to approve the combination with Tokyo Electron is scheduled for June 23. The detailed plans to integrate our two companies are taking shape. The level of engagement and strong working relationships within the integration teams are tremendous. This gives us high confidence that we can rapidly bring together the critical areas that will enable the new company to achieve its strategic and financial goals. We have also been developing the mission, vision and values that will be the foundation of the combined company’s culture and we will share more information about our progress at SEMICON in July. As we work through the integration planning process, we are even more confident that we can accelerate materials innovation for the industry and increase the value we deliver to our customers and shareholders. Turning to our market outlook, evolving trends in mobility and connectivity are driving industry growth and accelerating innovation in mobile chips, solid state storage and interactive displays. The advanced processors, sensors and memory needed to enable high end smartphones have driven significant growth in the silicon content of these devices. Consequently, the foundries continue to make substantial investments as they ramp 20 nanometer capacity and accelerate their pilot lines for 16 nanometer and 14 nanometer FinFET technology. We expect foundry spending to increase 10% to 20% in 2014 and be distributed over a broader customer base compared to recent years. Mobility and cloud computing are also driving demands for NAND memory and we expect bit growth to be about 40% this year. As a result of strong investments in advanced planar NAND, we believe total NAND spending could reach $7 billion for this year. Adoption of 3D NAND is progressing at a slower pace than previously anticipated, but we still see increasing investment as customers work to solve technical challenges in a transition from planer to 3D devices. DRAM customers are also investing more as they upgrade capacities at their advanced nodes to meet demand for mobile DRAM. We expect 2014 DRAM spending to be 10% to 15% higher than last year. Overall, while there have been some adjustments in customers investment plans in recent months, we maintain our view that 2014 wafer fab equipment could be up 10% to 20% relative to last year. In the display market, there are two primary factors driving growth. The first is TV, where average screen sizes are increasing at 1.5 inches to 2 inches annually, which is significantly higher than historic rates. Three, new Gen 8.5 factories are being built in China as our customers race to meet this growing TV area demand. The second is mobile, where displays are an important area of differentiation for smartphones and tablets. Higher definition screens are driving demand for low temperature polysilicon backplanes and we expect multiple new Gen 6 factories to be built in the next two years to meet the market’s needs. These strong market drivers in display have enabled us to book $340 million of new orders in our second fiscal quarter and while we expect our revenue patterns to be uneven due to shipment timing, our outlook for the display business remains positive. In semiconductor and display, new materials innovations are enabling key inflections by providing our customers with solutions that improve device performance, yield and cost. We see tremendous customer pull for Applied’s differentiated technologies and precision film deposition, materials modification, materials removal and interface engineering margin which are at the heart of key transistor inflections. We are also working with our customers to drive significant materials innovation and interconnect. Earlier this week, we launched our Volta CVD Cobalt system, this precision film deposition technology can be used to form CVD based cobalt liners and selective cobalt capping films that allow customers to overcome critical yield limiting issues as they scale copper interconnects at advanced nodes. This breakthrough strengthens our leadership position in interconnect, while growing the available market for Applied’s CVD products. Over the past 18 months, we have taken actions to support our growth strategy by shifting spending to our best opportunities, strengthening our processes and adding talent in critical areas of the organization. We have increased our technical capabilities in the field to better support new applications development for our customers. We strengthened our product development engine to accelerate new precision materials engineering innovations and we aligned our product portfolio to increase our focus on those programs that make the biggest impact for our customers and for Applied. We are starting to convert these actions and investments into market share momentum. In calendar 2013, we gained 1.4 points of wafer fab equipment market share ending the year at our highest level since 2006. We delivered positional share gains across the majority of our leadership businesses. Our PVD business gained 7 points of share in the year. epitaxy gained 5 points while our implant, thermal and CMP businesses all delivered strong gains. We also built positive momentum in areas that are large growth opportunities for us. We won 6 points of share in overall etch driven by gains in conductor etch. We continue to build momentum and expect to gain additional conductor etch share in 2014. Equally, our process diagnostics and control group is demonstrating its growth potential. We gained 5 points of share in wafer inspection and 3 points in litho metrology in 2013. And this past quarter, the group delivered its second highest revenue on record. We continue to see strong customer pull for our inspection technology, particularly in defect review. We are extending our leadership in this market with the strong adoption of our new G6 e-beam review tool. This market is also one of the fastest growing segments, with customers using the G6 more extensively to solve defect problems as they ramp new foundry and memory device technologies. Across the organization, we are focused on creating a strong pipeline of new, highly differentiated products to enable future inflections in logic, memory, and display. While we are making the required investments to grow, we are also driving superior financial performance. And as Bob will explain in a few minutes, we are making good progress towards our 2013 Analyst Day models. We have reduced the impact of our solar business on our overall performance and expect our EES group will achieve breakeven or better performance for the year. We continue to strengthen the organization in many critical areas, attracting top talent in engineering and the field. We are increasing our focus on high-value services for our large installed base of tools. Our customers are planning to ramp challenging new devices in existing fabs. We see an opportunity to work with them to accelerate yield, improve performance, and drive lower cost for these new device technologies. And we are driving improvement in performance, time, cost and quality across the company, so that we can execute better and be ready to effectively scale after we combine with Tokyo Electron. In summary, as we approach the midpoint of the year, 2014 is playing out largely as expected with global trends in mobility, connectivity, and display providing a strong foundation for customer investments in capacity and technology. We remained focused on applying our unique capabilities in precision materials engineering to enable major technology inflections for our customers. We are driving profitable growth, gaining market share, and making progress towards our long-term financial model. Our preparations to combine with Tokyo Electron are accelerating and we are incredibly excited by the opportunities this merger will bring for our customers, shareholders, and employees. Now, I will hand the call over to Bob who will provide additional details about our performance and outlook.
Bob Halliday: Thanks, Gary. We have been highly focused on investing to drive profitable growth over the short, medium and long-term. We have also very tightly managed our spending to increase our product development and field technical support, while simultaneously driving for higher levels of profitability. As Gary discussed, we gained market share in 2013. This progress was made with limited leverage from the new and disruptive products that have been funded and are making their way through the development pipeline to our customers. In fiscal 2014, we are on track for profitable growth, compared to the same period in 2013. Second quarter orders were up 16%, with SSG backlog at the highest level in the past six years. Revenue was up 19%. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin was at the highest level in six years. Operating profit exceeded 20% for the first time in nearly three years and earnings per share increased 75%, significantly outpacing revenue growth. We continued to focus on margin improvement even as we invest for growth. Our non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 44.2%, up 1.7 points sequentially, including 0.5 point of one-time benefits. We now expect to increase it by approximately 1.5 points in 2014 versus the prior year. R&D as a percentage of net sales has been running several points higher than in recent years. This is a headwind to our operating margins, which will become a tailwind as we introduce new and disruptive products in the future. Even with this higher level of investment, we are making progress towards our target operating model. All of our business segments delivered sequential operating margin improvement this quarter and the best performances in some time. On a non-GAAP basis, SSG operating margins were the highest in seven quarters. AGS’s were the highest in seven years. Display had its second highest result in 10 quarters and EES was profitable for the first time in 2.5 years. By focusing on margin improvement, even as we invest for growth, we believe we can deliver approximately 5 points of non-GAAP operating profit expansion for the year. Next, I will provide more color on some of the changes in our Q2 results versus the prior quarter. Orders of $2.6 billion were up 15% as growth in display and SSG orders were partially offset by a decline in AGS orders, which reflected the seasonal timing of service contract renewals. Net sales of $2.4 billion were in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin of 44.2% grew 1.7 points including 0.5 point of benefit from the partial recovery of a customs assessment charge we recorded in Q4 2013. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $559 million were within our guidance and higher sequentially due to the absence of Q1 shutdown savings and the addition of merit increases. We expect quarterly OpEx to be about $555 million, plus or minus $10 million for the remainder of the year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.7%, which was up from 22.5% in Q1. Both the quarterly rate and the expected annual rate have been impacted by a change in our forecast of regional revenue mix for the year. As a result, we expect the full year rate to be approximately 24%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 was in the high end of our guidance. Cash from operations of $437 million or 19% of revenue grew 17% reflecting higher profitability. We paid $122 million in dividends and ended the quarter with cash and investments up $313 million to $3.4 billion. Next, I will comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.7 billion were up 6% with increases in DRAM and logic more than offsetting declines in foundry and NAND. SSG net sales of $1.6 billion were up 7%, in line with our expectations as increases in DRAM and foundry offset decreases in NAND and logic. SSG non-GAAP operating margins increased 3 points to 27.3% on higher volume. AGS orders of $537 million were down 10% due mainly to the seasonal timing of service contract renewals. AGS net sales of $534 million were up 5% in line with our expectations. AGS non-GAAP operating margin increased over 3 points to 28.1% driven by higher revenue, favorable mix and the recovery of customs assessment charges. In display, orders grew substantially to $340 million reflecting large orders related to new TV facilities in China. These orders should result in revenue growth later in the year. Display net sales of $147 million were down 8% in line with our expectations. Display non-GAAP operating margin increased by 1 point to approximately 18% reflecting operational improvements. EES orders were $88 million and net sales more than doubled to $88 million in line with expectations. EES non-GAAP operating income was $7 million. Now, I will provide our third quarter business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to down 5% sequentially. This range represents expected growth of 13% and 19% year-over-year. Within this outlook, we expect SSG net sales to be down 2% to 6%. This range represents expected growth of 17% to 22% year-over-year. AGS net sales should be flat to up 5%. We expect display net sales to be down approximately 20% and EES net sales should be up 5% to 10%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.29. In summary, we are investing for profitable growth and now on track for year-over-year increases in revenue and profitability. We are very excited about our planned merger with Tokyo Electron, which will provide us with more strong products and technologies to enable our customers’ roadmaps, a larger installed base of systems to service, substantial economies of scale, and a unique opportunity to return more value to our shareholders. Applied and Tokyo Electron hope to see many of you in San Francisco on July 7. After the Applied Materials Analyst Briefing, we plan to hold a joint briefing to provide you with an update on our progress. Now, let me turn the call back over to Mike Sullivan for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Bob. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow up. Jennifer, let’s please begin.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: There has been a lot of controversy in the market relative to how the year was to going to play out, especially relative to people’s expectations as a couple of the bigger suppliers in the industry that have talked about weaker trends and then Lam and yourself have talked about things kind of stand pretty much as they were. Do you guys have any views as to what the differing views would be or why there is differing views from the major suppliers? Thanks.
Bob Halliday: I will take a shot at it, Jim. I will give you some data points. Number one, we did have strong orders in the quarter for both SSG and display and we ended the quarter with our highest backlog in years. So, that feels pretty good about little bit of wind at our back. Positionally, we are doing very well as a company on these transitions, whether they would be VNAND or FinFET. There has been speculation on a couple of concerns I think. One is some of the VNAND things may have pushed out and I think there is a general consensus, a little less spending in the short-term on that although we see that as very powerful longer term trend. But on the other hand, we do see a serious commitment by our customers to getting there on FinFETs. So, there might be a little bit of optimism coming on that in the intermediate term. And then I think specific to Applied, as I mentioned we have the strong backlog. We have very strong display wind in our back also for both TVs and the smaller displays. And the solar business is doing okay for us. So overall, I would say there is a little bit of pushes and shoves, maybe a little bit of softness people have talked about, but overall we feel pretty good about our position.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, I would say also if we look at across the market with what we are hearing from customers, the foundry spending is expanding to additional customers above what they were in 2013. So, based on what we are seeing from customers and even some increase in demand short-term from some customers, we see that business being pretty good for 2014. NAND demand is pretty strong and again we see that up. DRAM, we also believe is up. Logic, we think maybe flat or down. But if you look at all of the different customers in the segments and you add it all up based on what we are saying, we are still in the range of the 10% to 20%, maybe it’s more towards the bottom end of that range, but still in that range.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful. Thanks. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up and you guys had commented last quarter that you saw pretty healthy margin trends over the course of the year. Obviously, there is pushes and pulls based on what segments are spending and customers and timing and things of that nature, but how do you feel about the margin trajectory over the course of the year at this point?
Bob Halliday: Yes, I think we are making progress, Jim. You have to segment. Obviously, you segment it by our segments, that’s obvious. And if you look at it, Solar is doing a lot better. I think the costs have come down. We are into the black there. Display is doing really well as a business. If you go look at – if you also look at AGS, the margins were up. Then you look within semi and we are making sustainable progress on some of the underlying things, which are the costs are somewhat down, the positioning is good, the new products are starting to appear. And then you have some mix issues that helped us a little bit on the quarter. We had a little bit less etch and we had that one-time Korean thing, but I would say underlying progress is pretty good. We think it will be pretty good next quarter and up on the year.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: That’s great. Thanks so much. Good luck.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I know you guys don’t guide to orders, but curious if you could talk about your visibility there, expectations for volatility there, and then how you see spending linearity for WFE first half versus second half of the year?
Bob Halliday: Yes. We don’t – honestly, C.J., we don’t give exclusive guidance on orders. We feel that the business environment is okay. I think it’s not as a big concern as people say. We see pretty good strength in the second half. We see the FinFET stuff okay. As Gary said, the foundry spending is more spread out. I think to get greater visibility into the mix you have got to look below the top three guys. You have got to look at all those other spenders, the next four or five. And that strength year-on-year is more powerful than sometimes people focus on with the top three. So, I think the second half is okay. Traditionally, last few years, the fourth calendar quarter tends to be a little bit bigger than the third calendar quarter, but still too early to say.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group: That’s helpful. And as my follow-up, as you build on the market share gains in silicon in 2013, how do you see yourselves in ‘14 relative to the market? Can you give some color on what kind of outperformance you think you can do in silicon?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, sure. We have had a really good start to 2014 in a number of different businesses. This last quarter was very good and we look over the next two quarters, it’s kind of hard to see beyond the next six months. Those next two quarters also look pretty good for us. Major driver for the next few years is the transition customers are making in foundry and memory to dramatically different device architectures with FinFET and 3D NAND. These transitions are very good for us really enabled by materials innovation and we are optimistic that these transitions will grow our business and share as they happen. And beyond those leadership businesses, we are also seeing momentum in etch and PDC. And so you combine all of those factors together, we believe we are in a good position to grow our market share in 2014 and beyond.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Company.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company: ....give us the SSG order breakdown by a customer bucket?
Michael Sullivan: Okay. Tim, sorry, your phone was on mute for just a moment. Do you mind repeating the question, so we can make sure we had it?
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company: Sure, Mike. Can you provide the order breakdown by customer type for SSG?
Bob Halliday: Yes. Let me look you out there on that one. I think what we said on the call was from quarter-to-quarter, foundry was – flipping pages.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company: Sure.
Bob Halliday: Yes, if you look at quarter-to-quarter as we said in the call, we had pretty strong orders overall but we found foundry Q1 to – if you want to hear about ‘13, I will tell you right now.
Gary Dickerson: So why don’t we come back – Tim, do you have any other questions, when we get the data, we can come back?
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company: Okay. Sure, Gary. So Bob then the question just, I am trying to stick to the guidance, so it looks like you are guiding OpEx about flat, so to get to the middle of the EPS range it sort of implies the gross margin has to be up like 100 basis points sequentially on down revenue, is that the right math?
Bob Halliday: For Q2 to Q3?
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company: Yes.
Bob Halliday: Yes. We had pretty gross margins in Q2 and we think in Q3, we are pretty strong too. I don’t want to be specific, but I think it’s in the ballpark, slightly up a little bit, I don’t know if it’s 100 basis points.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company: Okay great.
Bob Halliday: Now, the other thing you got going Tim is you said the tax rate in the quarter, next quarter is probably a little lower because we guided for the year in 24.1%. And this quarter was 24.7%, so if you figure some benefit probably on gross margins, some benefit on tax, the math does the work.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Company: Okay. Then if you guys get those SSG order breakout, that would be great? Thanks.
Bob Halliday: Yes and I will give you some color, so Q1 to Q2 as we said on the call, foundry was pretty strong in Q2, but not as strong as in Q1 bookings, our fiscal quarters, right. We had – DRAM was up a fair amount, flash is down slightly and logic and other was up.
Gary Dickerson: Go ahead Jenifer.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.
Romit Shah -Nomura: I wanted to ask about just the deal with Tokyo Electron, it seems like the markets maybe a little bit more skeptical about the deal closing versus how you guys are thinking about it and particularly around just the regulatory approval process in some of these major countries, Gary could you just share with us your thoughts on getting regulatory approval. And then what milestones we should be focused on beyond, I know you mentioned the filing as well as the shareholder approval meeting later in June, what else should we be focused on? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Again, as we have more to announce, we will. But rather to their process, we really continue to expect the merger to close within the second half of 2014 and the process is proceeding pretty much as we expected. And we look forward to closing within the original timeline. The other thing I would say is that the level of engagement and working relationships within the integration teams are really tremendous. And as I also mentioned earlier that we really have increasing confidence that we can rapidly bring together their critical areas and enable the new company to achieve its strategic and financial goals. So again, from a timing standpoint pretty much similar to what we had originally communicated and no real change in expectations there.
Romit Shah -Nomura: And then can you – as you have spoken to some of your top customers about this deal, what’s been the reception?
Gary Dickerson: We are not going to comment on all of those discussions. What we have said before is, those discussions went pretty much as we expected. And I have engaged with pretty much all of our top customers in the last month and there really have been no surprises in any of those discussions.
Romit Shah -Nomura: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned that your gross margin year-over-year should be up about 1.4 points and Op margin around 5 points, if that is the case is it fair to assume that Op margin level Q3 and Q4 would be flattish and would it imply sales to be flat Q3 to Q4 or am I reading too much into it?
Bob Halliday: Yes. Well, this is the trap I get into when I give full year numbers. I don’t want to give Q4 guidance, Krish. We do want to give you some color, so I think our gross margins and Op margins in Q3 are in pretty good shape, I wouldn’t see why they would go down in Q4, but I don’t want to give specifics soon.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Got it. Fair enough. And then a question for Gary, I mean good job on the share gains last year, I am kind of curious you guys definitely had some pretty good share gain momentum in etch and process control last year and overall net share gain last year, I am kind of curious, after the deal is announced or has that share gain momentum continued the first five months of this year or over the last six months or do you think that share gain momentum has slowed down?
Gary Dickerson: Well, let me talk about etch first. We are really happy about the progress. We are making in conductor etch. We focused on investing in areas where we had the best opportunities to grow. And as we discussed this is paying off. As we discussed earlier with the 6 points of share gain last year, we have added a great talent into the team. The level of excitement is tremendously high. In the second quarter, we had the highest conductor etch revenue in the last seven years. And based on the interactions with customers, we believe that we will have further conductor etch share wins this year and continue to grow share in 2014 and beyond, so very, very good momentum in conductor etch. Inspection, last quarter we also had the second highest revenue quarter for PDC. And we anticipate 2014 could be a record year for this business, so very, very strong pull from customers in all segments including inspection and defect review. I think one thing that people really maybe are not fully aware of is that we have leadership in e-beam review. We introduced the G6 e-beam review tool this year, very strong pull from customers extending our leadership. And this is also one of the segments that is the fastest growing as customers are focusing on how to solve defect problems as they make these major transitions in foundry and memory, so very strong growth in the market, in the total available market in e-beam review and very strong share position. So really in both of those businesses in 2014 the perspective is very positive.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you very much, Gary.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Securities.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Securities: Question, first just on the foundry piece, I was wondering if you could give us an idea of roughly how much of the foundry spend this year you think will be on 28 nanometer and above and how much might be on say 20 nanometer, 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer?
Bob Halliday: And so we think the Fin stuff is around 25%, right. I think we think the Fin stuff is around 25%, the 20 nanometer grouped in there is net above that.
Michael Sullivan: That 25% is going to be 28 nanometer still…
Gary Dickerson: So most of – I would say 25% or so around FinFET technology this year. And really the bulk of the rest is 20 nanometer in 2014.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Securities: Got it. Okay, that’s helpful. And then I was just wondering on the cobalt cap announcement, it’s really interesting, can you give us an idea of what you think the incremental revenue opportunity might be and then what the rate of adoption is by customers maybe just roughly by nodes, which nodes they may be introduced into?
Gary Dickerson: Sure, absolutely. So interconnect scaling is really a major challenge for customers, they need to fill smaller and higher aspect ratio of structures with good device performance and high yield and this is getting really hard for future devices. So to address these issues we developed the integrated cobalt liner and also a selectively deposited capping layer to enable customers to continue to use copper for future nodes. The cobalt liner is integrated on the same platform with our PVD chambers, which is a really great opportunity to expand our market in interconnect. And the capping layer is really a unique selective film similar to epi where we have a huge growing business and enabling new capabilities for customers. If you look at the size of the markets, you have two steps that will go across five different layers, so it’s about 10 steps. And it’s about a couple of million dollars for every 1K wafer starts roughly in terms of the size of the business. And this year in CVD we anticipate this is going to be a strong year. We anticipate gaining several points of share and part of that is this new Cobalt CVD film. So we anticipate very strong adoption in logic and foundry for really all of the customers and that will add a fair amount of business in 2014.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Securities: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Maybe first going to the DRAM market and seeing the pickup in the CapEx spending as you look over the next couple of quarters and even to 2015 with some projected projects that are out there. Can you discuss the type of capital intensity you maybe seeing in future DRAM spending as it relates to your process segment versus some of the market share gains you maybe able to expect to gain in that customer segment?
Bob Halliday: DRAM, we think is up this year, Patrick. As we said, Q2 was up on Q1 for us in bookings. Q3 and Q4, we feel are better than Q1, but maybe not quite as good as Q2 for us. If you look at what’s going on there, on the periphery stuff, we are benefiting particularly in medium current and high current implant as it gets more logic like there is all sorts of gap fill stuff going on that’s helping us. We are going to be introducing cobalt with our PVD tools. Dielectric mesh looks good for us. And in etch we are making pretty good progress too. So, there is a bunch of transitions that are going on for us in the periphery, which is getting more logic like and also some of this capacitor stuff looks pretty good.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Great, that’s helpful. And maybe my follow-up question on the NAND side of things, what I was getting, I guess really customer specific, how do you see the challenges for most of the other players in terms of deciding to go to planar NAND versus their time of adoption or their rate of adoption of next generation 3D NAND?
Bob Halliday: Yes, what we see Patrick is really all of the customers are focused on the transition from planar to 3D NAND, because of the bit scaling opportunity that they have. Now, there are challenges in that transition. And we actually have a very strong position. In etch, that is really our strongest market segment, the planar and 3D NAND. And we have new applications that we are growing in that segment. We also have some unique technology that is focused on addressing the major challenges, yield challenges that customers have as they are making this transition from planar to 3D NAND, some new deposition technology. So, we really look at that being a really great opportunity. As we have talked about before the switch from planar to 3D NAND is really focused on thermal deposition and etch products. And we have made a lot of investment in those areas. We see this as a great opportunity for us to grow share as these transitions happen. What we have said is that our available market growth was 25% or 30% in the first generation. And then as you continue to scale the number of layers as they drive bit scaling that growth is even stronger for us. So, we believe that we are in a very good position as that transition happens. Now, it is the tough transition, but every single one of our customers are very focused really on technology buys to drive the development of that technology. Certainly we see 2015, the spending ramping a fair amount above what we see in 2014. So, most of the customers are really planning to ramp in ‘15 and ‘16. And this as we said is a very good opportunity for us.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Great, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: (indiscernible) results, thanks for them. May I ask the question? Gary, I guess my first question as it’s becoming clear that Moore’s Law capital intensity is going up, you are starting to see your customers and your customers’ customers kind of evolve their strategy. Last week, SanDisk kind of talked about a 3D CapEx spend that seems to be targeting flat dollars off of their ‘14 spend level intentionally. Talking about a longer period to ramp 3D, you have got Samsung this week talking about fully depleted SOI. I am just kind of curious as the economics start to become challenging and customers do things to extend nodes or slow progress, how does that impact kind of your view that you had at your Analyst Day in 2013 about a WFE number that can approach $37 billion?
Gary Dickerson: Well, Patrick [ph] as we talked about in the Analyst Day, we really sized our business at $30 billion. So, we are improving our profitability in our profile – sorry, we are really driving improvements in our business model at $30 billion. So, relative to the increasing CapEx spending, if you look at the planar to 3D NAND more spending is in the areas that are – where we participate and really where we have enabling technologies. So, you look at deposition etch and thermal processes that CapEx is going up and litho as a percentage is going down. So, that is a really very good opportunity for us. The other thing I would say just as I travel around and I visited pretty much all of the major customers in the last month or two, the drive – this is a real war for mobility leadership that’s happening. So, if you look at the memory area, the transition from planar to 3D NAND is a big bet that these different customers are focused on. And so they are all trying to get there first with the best technology. And the foundry competition is even more fierce, because people are focused on driving low-power, higher performance, more features. And so you look at this battle that’s going on, we absolutely see stronger pull from those customers. And as you said that the CapEx does go up as they are moving to those new devices. Fortunately, for us, they are very heavily leveraged with our materials, precision materials engineering technologies. So, the transitions are good for us, but it is a big battle and a big bet for all of these different customers as they go through this transition. So anyway, John, those are my thoughts, I don’t know, Bob, do you have any….
Bob Halliday: I think that’s accurate. I mean, we do see increase in capital intensity. We do see it playing well in the areas, where we compete. We do see that our customers are competing and then things like FinFET and VNAND are very powerful devices down the road. Now, VNAND when they go to second generation, it probably becomes more cost effective than first generation. FinFET, we will have to play out a little bit. One of the more intriguing things that’s starting to pop up on the FinFET stuff too is the interconnect which we talked about a little in the call. So, how it all plays out commercially in a couple of years, I am not sure. The other thing I think I said to you on an earlier call, John we are managing the company to achieve significant levels of profitability, a $30 billion wafer fab equipment, so that we are a very attractive company in terms of growing market share profitability at $30 billion to $37 billion.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Yes, helpful guys. And then Gary I guess as for my follow-up, you guys have historically been well-levered to do the largest foundry in the world over in Taiwan. I am just kind of curious how I should think about your relative share at sort of some of the other foundries like Samsung and GLOBALFOUNDRIES as you talked about it in your prepared comments, the foundry customer base kind of broadens out in the back half of the year. How different is your share position was kind of the number two, number three guys versus the number one guy?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, John, really the foundry segment is our strongest segment really across the board. So, the more foundry is growing, that’s really great for us. And we have a great opportunity as customers are introducing these new technologies, you gave more epi stuffs. You have a number of other areas that we talked about, the Cobalt CVD. A lot of these technologies we are seeing a broad adoption across all of these different customers. And so as this broadens out, that’s very good for us as that mix shifts towards stronger foundry spending.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Perfect, thanks guys.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Thank you. Yes. Maybe you could just follow-up on that last question on the sustainability of foundry orders coming from multiple customers. In your quarter, we saw two of your foundry customers announce a major strategic collaboration. I was just wondering historically have you seen these customer collaboration typically help improve order visibility in the near-term, but maybe this becomes a headwind for orders later on as they choose to build less fabs and do more sharing?
Bob Halliday: Yes, we have had some of this in the past, Stephen. You worry about all these things, because it’s a reasonably big deal, but in the end it hasn’t had huge impact. There are a few things going on that touch on what Gary just said. We do very well at places like foundry because we are enabling technology, if you look at PVD to metal gauge, look at epi, our products really help them solve, again as Gary says high value problem. So the benefit and value of our products is really high on foundries and particularly at inflections around metal gates, FinFETs and also in inflections in VNAND frankly. The inflection we are pursuing on DRAM is a little bit more in the periphery. So then if you go to customers consolidating, we have strong share in all the foundries and our enabling technology we had very high market share in those because we are enabling, so I think it will work out.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay. And then maybe for my follow-up question, just on the general silicon order trends, did you guys discuss that your silicon customer overlap is now close enough with Tokyo Electron, are you seeing the same big picture industry trends for silicon orders (indiscernible) after Tokyo Electron talked about I mean just a short order pause the June quarter with a recovery and maybe July, just wondering if you think you are close enough to them that you see the same big picture trends? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: We really don’t – we are not sharing any of that kind of information at this point, so I don’t think we would have a perspective on that.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Stephen.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Sullivan: Jenifer is Mahesh’s line un-muted because we are not hearing him.
Operator: And Mahesh your line is open.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Hello.
Michael Sullivan: Hi.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Sorry, I was (on a) headset, I apologize. So on your backlog it looks like you are getting better visibility in terms of orders on silicon SSD, your orders were up 6% and you are guiding revenue down 4%, is it specific to a customer or some segment that you are getting better visibility on the orders?
Gary Dickerson: I think we just have some good timing on backlog. We have pretty good positions in share. So typically, there are typical customers who give you backlog and lead times that tends to be logic and a little bit more foundry, a little less so memory. But I think I wouldn’t read too much into that.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And another question on DRAM, we have seen a pretty interesting trend in DRAM, we have seen lithography and process control guys have not seen the strength you and Tokyo Electron and Lam has seen, is there anything going on technologically in terms of the transition to 25 nanometer and 20 nanometer that is driving more of deposition in etch versus litho and process control?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Those are the areas that we see that are the strongest. I mean as Bob mentioned, the periphery is really changing to be more logic like, I mean it’s lagging certainly the foundry and logic people by a couple of nodes, but we are seeing really strong pull for implant. I was just in Asia with one of our customers and really very, very strong pull as they are moving to next generation DRAM devices. We talked about cobalt, some other films for the capacitors, etch, different etch steps, so I would agree that those areas we are seeing pretty strong pull.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank.
Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank: Yes, thanks for taking my question. So can you compare your market share in 3D NAND to-dare where you are in planar NAND and if you can give numbers, just through some general sense. And then also of that $7 billion in NAND spending for this year how much of that breakout to your 3D?
Bob Halliday: My memory is we are gaining share on both planar and 3D NAND. And I think our percentage of wafer fab equipment is slightly higher in 3D NAND because there is more deposition in etch. So our share of wafer fab equipment is up in both in – our share is up in both. The relative share is up more in 3D for two reasons. We are winning positions. And it’s more deposition etch-intensive. In terms of the spending mix between the two, it was about 30%...
Gary Dickerson: 30% this year. But as we talked about before there is may be 25%, 30% growth, just in first generation, I mean some people will also quote kind of what the growth is from planar to 3D NAND. But you really have to look at the number of layers in the stack, so for us it’s 25%, 30% as you go to first generation 3D NAND devices. And we did see an increase in market share in the first customers that were moving from planar to 3D NAND. We didn’t give an exact number and how much that share was going up, but there was a fair increase as we went through that transition.
Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank: And then I just want to probe further into AGS margins, which were pretty strong in this past quarter, can you talk a little bit more about what’s driving that margin outperformance, is it mix, is there something else going on and is this how to think about the segment as a new normal?
Bob Halliday: Yes. The margins for AGS were strong. They were the beneficiary of that 0.5 point of gross margin improvement for the overall company that was a recovery of a Korean customs audit that we did well on, that we reserved in Q4 ‘13. So it’s a little bit of one-time item in that. Generally, our AGS margins are doing better, I don’t know if the current quarter is exactly going to stay the same for the foreseeable future probably because of that Korean customer’s audit.
Gary Dickerson: Yes. One thing I would say, a couple of things I guess on AGS. If you think about what is happening with our customers in foundry and memory and in logic, they are making major transitions in device technology. So as they are moving to FinFET, they are moving from planar to 3D NAND. As they are shrinking these devices, defects become a bigger issue, uniformity becomes a bigger issue, edge die yield, tool stability. So for our customers to extend our large install base of tools as they are making these transitions, they are really pulling on us more and more and that really gives us an opportunity in AGS. The other thing is we really are making major changes in our organization to drive lower cost and also improve our ability in the parts business to grow that parts business, lower cost for customers and also providing parts that do give lower defects, better uniformity these types of capabilities. So we are making – really, it’s a big drive for us and we see this as an opportunity for us to grow that business.
Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank: Great that’s all for me. Thanks guys.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Just wanted to revisit your – how your book to bill or booking versus revenue for SSG, it’s been above 1 point for like three quarters, but you guys guided down, but I was just wondering, is it just based on timing of shipment. And then maybe some color on the linearity of shipment in the June quarter?
Bob Halliday: Well, the book to bill has been north of 1, as you said Edwin, we are guiding down on revs because even though we don’t think there is any big time pause, it’s typically the last few years that Q3 in terms of order trend isn’t quite as high as other quarters. So I don’t think it’s a big time pause, I think we are being helped by second tier buying, but it’s probably off a little bit in orders.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Actually that’s very helpful. And then just you talked a little bit about the etch and inspection share gain, sounds obviously very impressive, just curious, is there anyway you can kind of quantify where is it coming from, any particular area like foundry, memory or logic that you are seeing stronger pull on your customer side for those products. And as you integrate with TEL, do you see those two areas being further rooms for gaining share and area with the most opportunities or do you see other areas that you see, that you might have a lot of opportunity to gain share?
Gary Dickerson: Well, I think kind of the big picture for us is that these major technology transitions that are happening within foundry, logic, memory, huge changes in the transistor, from planar to 3D NAND, those – that’s the big picture. And we talked about significant growth in PVD and epi and a number of different areas and we really see that continuing. There really are more steps that are being added as the customers are trying to drive device scaling and it is very hard for them to make these transitions. And really more and more focused on materials innovation, so I would say that is the major theme for us. And that provides a very good environment over the next few years as the customers ramp those new devices. Now within etch, we were fortunate last year that we had the 6 points of share gain in overall etch. And really based on our gains in conductor etch and as I said earlier, we had last quarter the highest conductor etch revenue in seven years and we really have very strong pull from customers. Certainly in NAND flash, we see that market being very strong. We are also – we also anticipate that we will grow our business in foundry this year. And then the other area that is an inflection is around selective material removal, where we have very strong products and we see that technology continuing adoption as the customers are implementing these new device structures. So, we really see a really great opportunity in etch for us to continue to grow in conductor etch. One of the things I talked about also is that we are not trying to boil the ocean. So, we have focused on the areas, where we thought that we had the best opportunities. And certainly, we saw that conductor etch was a great opportunity. We have very strong pull from customers in conductor etch and we have increased our investment, shifted money into that segment and that’s where we see continued growth in 2014 and beyond.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Thanks. That’s all I have. Thank you 
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark Heller - CLSA: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a question on the foundry orders, the mix within that and also when you noted broader foundry spending in the second half, are we talking – is this mostly on FinFET spending or is it 20 nanometer or 28 nanometer?
Bob Halliday: Yes. What you are seeing in the second half, you are starting to get a little bit bigger pull recently for FinFET stuff. So, we said on the year, it was about 25% FinFET stuff across foundries and about 75% planar. The planar stuff was more weighted to the beginning of the year and the FinFET stuff is more weighted to the end of the year. And recently, it’s been in public domain a lot last month or so. People have become a little bit more worried about VNAND timing this year versus next year. I think there is a little bit more pull recently for FinFET.
Mark Heller - CLSA: But are you seeing any increase in more lagging etch demand like 28 nanometer?
Bob Halliday: A little bit.
Mark Heller - CLSA: And the other question, any thoughts on the recent Samsung ST announcement with silicon-on-insulator, what is your view on that technology and the potential implications for equipment spending?
Bob Halliday: Yes, we know about silicon-on-insulator technology for a while now. It’s been around for a while. It’s hard for us to see a big inflection here, but we haven’t spent a lot of time on it either.
Mark Heller - CLSA: Thanks. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Ben Pang with Northland Capital.
Ben Pang - Northland Capital: Thank you for taking my question. On the outlook for spending, I think you mentioned an answer to a previous question that you are looking at the low-end now rather than the high end of the range, what’s the change – what segment has changed the most year-to-date?
Bob Halliday: I don’t think we have changed a lot. We didn’t change our range. We are probably a little bit lower in the range. I think it’s the stuff people have talked about a little bit. NAND – the total NAND is a little bit off probably, not big time. We are still at around the $7 billion number, but a little bit and I think it’s mostly timing between years also.
Ben Pang - Northland Capital: Okay. So, it’s primarily NAND spending is where you see the – just to be clear about it, that’s kind of where you guys also – this is not based on – I guess, this is based on your own view from your customers, correct?
Bob Halliday: Yes, it’s in the….
Gary Dickerson: Yes, absolutely. And again, I think that as Bob talked about, timing really can make a difference as you get to an end of the calendar year and someone pushes out any of these technologies by one quarter, but we basically are in constant communication with our customers and the forecast that we have right now is pretty much aligned with what we hear from them.
Ben Pang - Northland Capital: On the flipside, what gets you to 20%?
Gary Dickerson: If you pull in, as they get more aggressive on FinFET or pickup NAND back to where they were.
Ben Pang - Northland Capital: Okay. And then one quick follow-up, on the capital intensity, you commented on lithography having lower capital intensity, is that because the number of critical layers is slowing down as you go to FinFET?
Gary Dickerson: No, we talked about really on 3D NAND versus planar and the feature sizes are increasing as that’s the reason why they are going. Again, they are going to the 3D scaling versus 2D scaling. So, it’s not shrinking the dimensions as there is the transition from planar to 3D NAND. So again, what we see from the big – our large customers etch, deposition and thermo processors are going up and litho because you are scaling vertically, not horizontally, the feature sizes are not as demanding and that is reducing the percentage of litho CapEx in 3D NAND.
Bob Halliday: Yes. It’s more of a NAND discussion, Ben.
Ben Pang - Northland Capital: So, if I look at it for the total WFE space, even your guidance NAND, 3D NAND outlook is like 5% right of total, right like $2 billion or 7% or something of the total. So, the overall WFE waiting, do you really expect a big change in your sort of developed market, because litho goes down for this year?
Bob Halliday: Ben, you are saying, you think NAND spending is only 5% of…
Gary Dickerson: No, Ben, again what we are seeing is…
Ben Pang - Northland Capital: Yes, I think you guys have 7% and then 30% of that, right?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. So, what we are saying is basically when that transition happens, we are not talking specifically about the mix, where we did give those numbers on 2014, but as the 3D NAND ramps, our total available market goes up and then it’s just a function of how much of that spending is happening in ‘14 versus ‘15 and ‘16, but definitely as that device ramps, that’s good for us.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Ben. And Jennifer, we are running a little over. So, I would like to ask you if we have maybe two more questioners in the queue please.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson & Company.
Tom Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Company: In your outlook for the next year, how many new fab, the new greenfield fabs do you see versus just upgrades to existing facilities?
Gary Dickerson: Well, typically again when you say what ends up happening as the customers now will divide these investments into multiple phases. So, they are counting differently. Let me give you some color. So they are going to sort of these mega fabs for bunch of reasons. So, if you look at the Xi’an Fab, the total Xi’an Fab is I think 220,000 wafer starts in multiple phases. The total fab ‘14 build out eventually is over 200,000 wafer starts, I think. So, these mega fabs make it a little bit harder to count a greenfield fab, because they do it in phases now. If you look at wafer starts and pulling up that data, that’s a fair amount. Do you have the wafer starts?
Bob Halliday: Five segments.
Gary Dickerson: So, if you look at – we think 3D is up to about 80,000 by the end of the year. That’s including about 30,000 from last year.
Tom Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Company: Okay.
Gary Dickerson: And so wafer starts are up a fair amount. We have foundry there. I mean, foundry is up quite a bit too, but it’s more about wafer starts than greenfield fabs, I think.
Tom Diffely - D. A. Davidson & Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Most of the good questions have already been asked. I will just ask couple of follow-ups. The first one has to do the breakdown of the backlog. Bob, I am looking at your display backlog is up 65% Q-over-Q and up almost 30% year-over-year and then on SSG, backlog is down 7% year-over-year. How should we think about the margin profile, especially some of these display equipments are shipped in the latter part of the year? And I am asking this because I am under assumption the display margins are much lower than SSG, so if nothing happens or nothing dramatic happens to the SSG backlog, how does the larger mix of display is going to impact the overall margin? And I have a follow-up.
Bob Halliday: There are a couple of things. Display backlog is up significantly, but year-on-year, I think the SSG backlog is also up. So, we are in okay, pretty good shape on both in terms of the mix. Gross margins are higher as you know in SSG versus display, but display operating margins have been trending up reasonably well. So, the gap isn’t as big as it used to be. Third, the lead times for display equipment are much longer. So, I don’t think we are going to have a big bump in our operating margins in any given quarter, because of unusual display disparities either in operating margins or in huge volume of business. I think it will be manageable.
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Got it. And then one follow-up to your commentary about managing the business for WFE of $30 billion, should I assume that your SSG operating margin would grow back towards low 30%. I am looking at July of 2012, for the same revenue as you did in April of this year, operating margin was about 400 basis point higher. So, should we think about cost cutting to the point that you would be able to squeeze that much margin expansion?
Bob Halliday: Well, if you go look at the model, we showed you last Analyst Day July 7 or 8 last year, we trended up to 25% operating margins at $37 billion number. And now some people including John earlier on the call, was worried that it wouldn’t be $37 billion environment. Our model, we showed also on that day was at a $30 billion environment. We are going to do about $22.5 billion. And so to make that model work between the $30 billion and the $37 billion, you need to have an improvement in SSG operating margin. As we said today earlier, across the whole company if you look at our spending in $8 billion revenue environment, which was 2004, ‘08 and sort of ‘12/13, we are spending about 4 points higher as a company on R&D as a percentage of sales. And most of that’s in SSG. So, we expect not only that our spending as a percentage of sales will be more favorable, but we will start to get growth in sales, especially in SSG as these new products hit the market. So, the short answer to your question is, yes.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, Mehdi, the other thing I would say is that we have talked before about shifting over $200 million maybe as much as $300 million of OpEx spending. EES is now getting back into the black. We have shifted a lot of money out of that. We have shifted a lot of money out of headquarters functions into the semiconductor R&D. So, the operating margins as you pointed out correctly are lower, but we really believe that those investments that we are making in SSG are important for our customers as they move to these new device technologies, FinFET, first generation, future generations, the interconnect technologies, new memory technologies. We really think those investments are important for our customers for the industry and we believe that we will get a good return on those investments. So, there is not going to be any reduction in that R&D spending in the near term.
Bob Halliday: Yes, I think that operating – to resonate what both of you said, I believe we can get to the type of numbers you are saying in a moderate spending environment. And I believe the way we will do it will largely be – we will start to kick in some revenue growth that we are investing in for now.
Michael Sullivan: Great. So, Mehdi thanks for your question and we would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we would really hope to see many of you in San Francisco for the SEMICON West briefing on July 7, the afternoon of July 7. So, thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call and you may now disconnect.

Gary Dickerson:  Thanks Mike and good afternoon. In our first fiscal quarter of 2014 Applied Materials delivered earnings near the high-end of our guidance range, while demonstrating momentum in revenue, orders and market share. This performance reflects healthy investments by our semiconductor and display customers and major technology trends that are playing to our strengths in precision materials engineering. For Applied 2013 was a transformative year, we changed our spending profile and shifted more investment to product development. We strengthened our organization and business processes in key areas. And we started to prove the growth potential of our etch, inspection and display businesses. In 2014 every employee across the organization is focused on building our momentum for profitable growth. We are driving performance improvements in our financial model, improving product time to market and cost, driving higher quality and getting the organization ready for our merger with Tokyo Electron. In recent months we have taken significant steps forward with our preparations for the merger. A joint Applied Tokyo Electron integration team is developing the detailed plan to being the two companies together. We’re delighted with the level of engagement, enthusiasm and the strong working relationships that are already forming. The progress this team is making gives us increased confidence that we will be ready to execute as soon as the merger closes. Each company is meeting regularly with customers to ensure that we are aligned with their priorities. Our discussions have centered on the value inherent in our combined ability to accelerate solutions for the industry’s major materials innovation challenges. The new company will be able to deliver more innovative products faster and at lower cost. We will have broader and deeper R&D capabilities to address roadmaps more effectively and with greater speed. By combining our field technical capabilities and best practices, we can collaborate more closely with our customers to support the rapid development of new device performance and yields solutions. And through operating synergies in many areas, we can focus our R&D investments to deliver the cost of ownership and materials engineering innovations that really move the industry forward. We remained confident that we will receive approval for the merger in the mid to second half of this year and we expect to submit our S4 securities registration statement after we have filed Applied’s Form-Q for this past quarter. Turning to our market outlook, we believe 2013 wafer fab equipment spending ended the year towards the midpoint of our range of $27 billion to $30 billion. We expect investment levels to be stronger in 2014, up 10% to 20% driven by higher spending in foundry and memory. The foundries remained the biggest component of wafer fab equipment, as they ramp new factories to fulfill demand for advanced mobile chips and race to introduce new technology to enable devices with higher performance and longer battery life. We expect foundry investment to grow 10% to 20% this year, which is very positive for Applied as we have our strongest share positions as these customers and continue to make gains.  Approximately half of total foundry spending this year will be focused on ramping 20 nanometer technology amended full for our products that enable transistor performance. And in our first quarter we have generated record orders in Taiwan. In addition, we recorded our highest ever quarterly net sales in FE, second highest shipments of medium implant tools and our highest quarterly PVD orders in a decade. Leading customers are also making significant investments in their pilot lines for FinFET. This technology has enabled biomaterials innovation and Applied has a broad and unique portfolio of products to enable flexion. We are collaborating early and deeply with our customers to ensure that they can quickly transition FinFET into volume production with the right performance, yield and cost. We also expect a stronger year of spending by NAND customers, as mobility supports bit growth demand in the 40% to 50% range and 3D technology is introduced. We anticipate that total NAND investment will be around $7 billion with incremental spending in advanced planar NAND and initial investments in 3D NAND. The transition from planar to 3D NAND has enabled biomaterials innovation in thermal, deposition and etch processes. This plays directly to Applied’s strengths in precision materials engineering and expands our total available market by about 25% for first generation devices. Overall, we are making significant gains in planar and 3D NAND. In our first quarter, we generated our highest NAND net sales in the past seven years.  Consumption of mobile DRAM is also growing, providing a good foundation for increased investments in 2014. We expect DRAM customers to focus their spending on upgrading capacity to advanced nodes. In logic, we anticipate investment levels to be flat to down relative to 2013 with a high level of focus on advanced technology.  Moving to the display market, we expect the TV unit growth rate to be low single-digit for the year ahead. However average TV sizes are growing at 1.2 to 2 inches annually which is significantly higher than historic norms. This is driving area growth in the 15% range which we believe is sufficient to support investment in three new Gen 8.5 factories.  In mobile, screen resolution is becoming an important differentiator and we see significant growth in higher definition screens that require low temperature polysilicon backplanes. Consequently, we expect multiple Gen 6 LTPS factories to be built in the next 12 to 18 months to support this demand. Overall, we believe we have the potential to book $500 million of display orders over the next two quarters, although revenue patterns for the year maybe uneven as this equipment is delivered. In both semiconductor and display, materials innovation is the key to enabling performance gains and lower costs for customers. FinFET, 3D NAND, cost effective device scaling and next generation displays are all enabled by precision materials engineering. Applied differentiated technologies in precision film deposition, materials removal, materials modification and interface engineering are enabling these key inflections. To support our customers’ roadmaps, we accelerated R&D in fiscal 2013 by increasing our annual investment run rate in 300 millimeter semiconductor product development by $200 million, adding more than 500 R&D engineers. We are also investing over $150 million of capital and new lab capabilities. These investments have driven market share gains in our served market as well as increased our overall wafer fab equipment share in calendar 2013. We are showing momentum in our traditional leadership areas and over the past year we have started to demonstrate excellent progress in markets that are large growth opportunities for us.  In conductor etch; we have focused our strategy in the areas where we can deliver differentiated technology to address our customers’ most pressing challenges. We believe we gained around 5 points of overall etch share in 2013 and continue to build momentum at leading memory and foundry customers. In wafer inspection and defect review, we believe we gained between 4 and 6 points of share last year. We have made investments in R&D and field technical support enabling us to increase our layer qualification in logic and foundry. Our UVision brightfield inspection product line delivered record net sales for the calendar year and our new UVision6 tool has recently being qualified by a leading customer for their most advanced node. In addition, we are strengthening our leadership in the e-beam review market. In display, our pivot PiVot PVD tool continues to gain traction, complementing our clear leadership position in CVD. In the past quarter we secured 100% of the PVD and CVD business at the industry’s largest metal oxide factory. Through increased R&D investment and focused portfolio management, we are creating a strong pipeline of new highly differentiated products to enable future infections in logic, memory and display. Over the past quarter we have seen a number of customers accelerating their qualification of some of our most advanced products. This underlines the fundamental role of new materials engineering solutions in realizing next generation devices. As we look to 2014 and beyond, we are incredibly excited about the future. We are uniquely positioned to apply our differentiated capabilities in precision materials engineering to enable major customer inflections and cost effective device scaling. This provides us with a great platform to build momentum for profitable growth. We remain highly focused on execution to ensure we take full advantage of these opportunities and to demonstrate progress against our financial performance goals. We are preparing the organization for our merger with Tokyo Electron, a combination that will enable us to accelerate our ability to address the major materials innovation challenges facing the industry and increase the value we provide customers and shareholders. I will now hand the call over to Bob, who will provide additional details about our performance and outlook.
Bob Halliday:  Thanks Gary. Over the last year we have discussed our commitment to accelerating momentum for profitable growth. This entails a commitment to grow profitably and accelerate our growth momentum. To grow we are aggressively rebalancing our spending towards semi and display products and tactical field resources focused on disruptive high value products. This quarter we increased R&D to 64.3% of R&D plus SG&A, which was up from 57% a year ago. We also increased our technical field resources by almost 20% in the same period. To grow profitably while making these investments, we are also driving improvements to our operating margins to achieve the profitability targets we have set out for the company. We are driving for return on these investments in the short, intermediate and long-term. In the short-term Gary indicated some investments that are already giving us momentum. In inspection we leverage our investment in the technical applications organization to increase our layer qualifications and market share. In etch we rapidly iterated new products to win market share in both planar and 3D NAND. In the intermediate term, we see returns on our investments including more EPI steps utilizing new materials. Our new CVD tool which improves critical film control and the new CMP tool which enables higher cross [way for deployment]. In the longer-term our investments are targeting highly differentiated products in disruptive applications, some of which such as selected materials removal are $1 billion opportunities. Even while investing for future growth, we are striving to improve our operating margins, which increased in each of the past five quarters, benefiting both from revenue growth and our actions to improve them all. This level of operating margin included R&D investment that is approximately four points above our history at the similar revenue levels. We are driving improvements in gross margins by delivering a greater mix of high value products in semiconductor and display and achieving materials cost reductions. Our Q1 gross margins exceeded our original expectations and based on current business projections we now expect Q2 gross margins to be better than previously communicated. Our current projections are that Q3 and Q4 gross margins will further increase, resulting in over 100 basis point of improvement for the year. To further improve our model, we also reduced EES spending to below $25 million in Q1, down 40% from the same quarter last year. Our goal is for EES to breakeven for the year. To accelerate our growth momentum we are revving up our product development engine. As Gary mentioned we are increasing our capital investment in R&D development tools by $150 million. Moreover we never stopped critical development projects, including during holiday shutdowns. We are also excited about our pilot manufacturing line which has already reduced product development cycle times while improving our initial product costs.  Next I’ll summarize some of the changes in our Q1 results versus the prior quarter. Orders of $2.3 billion were up 9% as growth in SSG and AGS was partially offset by a push out at display orders, net sales of $2.2 billion were at the high end of our expectations. Non-GAAP gross margin of 42.5% was up by about 0.5 due to higher silicon mix, non-GAAP operating expenses were $550 million, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23%, non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 was in the upper end of our guidance range.  Cash from operations of $372 million was up substantially reflecting good collections and higher net income; we paid $120 million in dividends and ended the quarter with cash and investments up $226 million to $3.1 billion.  Next I’ll comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders of $1.6 billion were up 13%, with increases in foundry and NAND offset by decline in logic and DRAM. SSG net sales of $1.5 billion were at the high end of our expectation as increases in NAND and foundry offset decreases in Logic and DRAM. SSG’s non-GAAP operating margin increased three points to 24.1% on higher volume and favorable product mix.  AGS orders of $597 million were up 9% due mainly to an increase in 200-millimeter equipment owners. AGS net sales of $507 million were in line with expectations. AGS’ non-GAAP operating margin increased over three points 24.9%, driven by favorable mix in the higher spares margins.  In display orders of $79 million were below our expectation reflecting the customer push out. However we expect a solid year for both TV and mobile investments. Display net sales of $159 million were flat which was above our expectations, due in part to grow the pivot PVD revenue which achieved a new record driven by share gains. Display non-GAAP offering margin increased by five points, 17% reflecting operational improvements. EES orders of $40 million were flat and net sales of $40 million were down 9%, the EES non-GAAP operating loss climbed to $10 million.  Now I will provide our Q2 business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 3-10% sequentially. Within this outlook we expect SSG net sales to be up by 6-10%. AGS net sales should be approximately flat; we expect display net sales to be down, flat to down 15%, consistent with the uneven revenue patterns of this business. And EES net sales should more than double. We expect our quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million plus or minus $10 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25-$0.29.  In summary we are investing for growth while improving our model and accelerate our new product pipeline. We are very excited about our planned merger with Tokyo Electron, which will provide us with more strong products and technologies, to enable our customers' roadmap, a larger installed base of systems to service, substantial economies of scale and a unique opportunity to return more value to our shareholders.  Now let me turn the call back over to Mike Sullivan for questions. 
Mike Sullivan:  Thanks Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow up. Friends, let’s please begin. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan; please go ahead with your question.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan:  Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution, as you look at your pipeline for the next few quarters, beyond fiscal Q2 I know there’s been some concern about the potential for a pause in your SSG business just given the strong order trends, especially within foundry and NAND, obviously there will be some digestion, qualification and ramps, but obviously you’ve not yet seen some of your DRAM customers transitioning to different nodes, we haven’t seen the tier 2 foundries and your logic customer has been relatively muted, so I guess the question is, how are you thinking directionally about sort of the near term trajectory within SSG.
Unidentified company representative:  Hi Harlan, obviously we only guided for the next quarter, we think the year’s pretty good as we said, the year is up 10-20%, as we do have very large customers sometimes there’s bumps along the road in any given quarter but right now we see the second half pretty good actually, we think the year is pretty good and the balance between the years is pretty good and I think our position within these inflexions is really good.
Gary Dickerson:  Yes on the foundry customers 20-nanometer ramp is going to be major factor in terms of CapEx spending this year. We also see all of the customers really focused on FinFET, the FinFET transition, that’s a huge strategic battle for all of the different foundry customers so we see more technology buys this year as all of those customers raised to be the first to have a cost effective FinFET device with high yield. And we also see as you mentioned a broadening relative to the foundry investments that is positive for the year. NAND is also up both in planar and in 3D NAND, 3D NAND really mostly focused on technology buys for those customers.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan: Great. Thank you for that answer. And then good job on the OpEx to syncline here in Q1 and on the guide for Q2. Bob, how should we think about you OpEx trajectory either on an absolute basis or relative to your sales growth as we think about the second half?
Bob Halliday: I think as we said, we’re basically flat in the second quarter. I think we had some R&D projects, a few one which we continue to pursue as well as aggressively managing the balance between pushing products out faster and spending, so we have those dials, we're always monitoring. My guess is next quarter is the 550 number, after that could be up a little bit but not big time pretty close.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks to let me ask the questions, congratulations on good results. Gary I wondering if you can just give us some of your insights relative to your 10% to 20% year-over-year growth range for ’14, what are the variables in your mind that drive that to the low end versus the high end of the range, is it simply how end demand for 20-nanometer plays out as they ramp that capacity or there are other variable that you’re thinking about within that range?
Gary Dickerson: Well, again, any one customer shifting at the end of the year can change that number a fair amount, if a project which is out one quarter that makes a big difference in terms of the end result. But if you look overall again on the foundry customers, certainly 20-nonometer ramping is a big factor in foundry and that one it looks like that is pretty much on tract. FinFET is a big, really strategic battle for our customers and we see a lot of focus there from a technology development perspective not so much significant capacity buying in 2014, but definitely that’s a factor in the overall CapEx. And then we do see incremental buying if you go below the first three customers in a broadening of CapEx spending in 2014. NAND flash, we see certainly good demand in that market and so planar NAND investment is definitely picking up. And on 3D NAND I think it’s well known, one customer is ramping capacity there. But this is really another important strategic battle in the NAND business and we see incremental spending from a technology standpoint really across the Board for all of those different customers. That transition from planar to 3D is a tough transition. We’ve talked about that being really leveraging a lot of the technologies we have we then applied on the materials innovation, but it is a tough technology transition. So I would say one factor is really relating to how fast that yield ramps and the cost comes down and also the adoption of those new devices with the end-customers is another factor.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: And then Gary as my follow-up just focusing on memory overall, clearly DRAM orders were down pretty healthy in the quarter for you, but if you look at both DRAM and NAND and you combine that for you and you look at where you are today versus sort of some of the peak levels you saw in April 2010 or even April 2007, you seemed to be down further from peaks and some of your peers and I guess I’m just trying to figure out what’s driving that, is it really based upon the fact that a lot of your share gains come at 3D and you’re seeing more strength at planar capacity or can you help me understand, you seem to be lower off of your peak than some of your peers in memory overall?
Gary Dickerson: Well I think and as we mentioned, NAND this last quarter for us was really the highest it’s been in seven years. So we have a lot of momentum there both in planar and 3D and that one we also think will be very strong for us going forward. A lot of tough technology inflections we have really great products around a lot of these critical processes, we talked about some of that in the July 8th Investor Meeting and that we are still very much on track with what we discussed.  In the DRAM market, one of the changes that are happening there is really in the periphery where that’s becoming more logic like, that’s another one that really periphery hasn’t been there in the past because the periphery is behind of course where logic is but that is also helping us going forward in the DRAM business. And we do some momentum there in other products but overall memory for us has been better than it’s been in a long time and we have good opportunities to grow going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Great guys, thanks so much for taking the question I appreciate it. Gary on 3D NAND your comments there are appreciated. We've heard some companies say this week at their conference that there could be two customers actually running 3D NAND wafer starts by the end of 2014, not just the one significant one. Is that consistent with your view and if it is, we seem to have come a long way from six months ago when people doubted the 3D NAND was even going to work to some customers actually accelerating adoption?
Gary Dickerson: Well, thanks for the question. Just with a customer, another customer yesterday and they are planning to convert one of their factories from planner to 3D NAND. But what I would also -- so -- and all of the customers are very focused on this technology, the opportunity for bit scaling, it's pretty compelling but what I would also -- so that’s absolutely correct. What I would also say is that this is a difficult transition. Customers are making good progress in the transition but I think it’s somewhat too early to call in terms of actually how big this will be in 2014. Certainly 2015 there is a lot of customers that are ramping or planning to ramp 3D NAND technology. We're in calendar ’14 and a lot of things have to line up really for significant capacity expansions in this calendar year. Again, it is very compelling but you have also a tough technology transition and then also adoption from an end user perspective that still has to play out this year.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: It’s helpful. Thanks. For the follow up on the foundry side again foundries and other topics has gotten pretty contentious slightly with some people very concerned about foundry spending for the year after TSMC guided to being down a little bit. You’re suggesting foundry CapEx is going to be up comfortably. Do you think that’s more of a function of some of the other foundries beyond TSMC being more aggressive and I know global foundries made some high profile announcements. Where do you think there is some spending happening that might be slightly different from publicly stated budgets? Thanks a lot.
Gary Dickerson: Well thanks. Yes, I think we’re not going to comment on anything our customers are saying. But we certainly see a broadening of the CapEx spending in 2014 in foundry. And as I talked about earlier certainly we see very healthy spending on 20 nanometer in 2014, FinFET is a very critical strategic battle in the war for mobility leadership. All of our customers are very focused in that area and technology buys in FinFET are also going to be a factor in 2014.
Bob Halliday: Yes, this is Bob, [indiscernible] Jim but going to back to what you said and John, every year you try and characterize and get a feel for the year. Mine 2014s characterized by two things. One is, there is a lot of technology inflections coming whether it’s VNAND or its [indiscernible] and tough challenge one. They are compelling ones when they provide great value but there is a number of real challenging technology inflections issue number one.  Number two, the spending were a little broader than it's been in last couple of years. So some of the foundries are spending money you haven’t seen this much in the past so it’s spreading out more. And what does that mean for Applied Materials? I think the technology inflections are a great opportunity for us and where you see us gain share particularly are on those inflections and foundry and NAND. As those inflections come to bear in DRAM particularly in the periphery we would do well in inflections. So inflections are great opportunities for Applied particularly as those inflections are going more to materials innovation.
Gary Dickerson: And I guess one more thing I would say on this one is, I really believe that a really key theme is around the materials inflections. If you look at what’s happening in the foundry business, it’s about transistor interconnectors becoming more difficult. And that’s all new materials enabling these changes in device performance. The same thing is true certainly in NAND. And if you look at DRAM to keep scaling those devices from a cost effective standpoint, there are also going to be major changes in the future around materials and devices that are also playing into the sweet spot of Applied Materials.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company: Thanks a lot. Couple of questions, first, Gary how do you think about the trajectory of this year? You just put out a billion dollars in foundry orders and you put up a billion dollars in orders out of Taiwan, phase one of a large 3D NAND project is basically done now and we’re sort of waiting on FinFET to ramp. So do you at all worry that there is this pause sort of in the middle of the year or do you think that there is enough other stuff happening?
Bob Halliday: Hey Tim, Gary just waved to me to take this one first. We got to get one of those video conferencing systems. So here is what [indiscernible] help a little bit. If you look at the last couple of years, there has been little bit of seasonality where the big foundry customers in particular buy more heavily -- give you orders more heavily in the [frontend of the year] get ready sort of just to be back to school, now it's more Christmas and Chinese New Year.  So, you are probably going to get a little bit of that waiting this year. It does look like it’s not going to be a big drop-off in the middle as people predict because we have more spread among different customers, so it’s more spread out as I said earlier.  The second one is that we have these technology inflections. Now those are the ones that you guys are poking at that are harder to lead. How big is 20 nanometer and how soon are FinFETs ready. What we see is customers aggressively pursuing those and frankly aggressively pursuing them with some of our tools and our solutions.  The cutover from one node to another, not exactly sure of the smoothness of that cutover, the two things that make us feel better are one is, some more customers buying for different nodes right now and two, they are really aggressively pursuing these technologies because they are very compelling. And three, they are aggressively pursuing it with us. So is there a little bit of a bubble in here somewhere maybe, but it's hard to read because of the inflections.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company:  Got it, okay, thanks. And then maybe just Gary, relative to the proposed merger, and I don’t know if you can imagine this question, but are you seeing any customer blowback not from their tone or anything like that but from them maybe trying to shift share to other vendors in an attempt to sort of like prepare for, when this merger closes, are you seeing any of that?
Gary Dickerson:  Well, Tim, the key thing for our customers, they are all in really strategic inflections for their business, if you look at the foundry customers ramping 20 nanometer successfully is critically important, transitioning the FinFET technology is critically important, this transition from planar to 3D NAND, all of those things are involving really in the sweet spot for Applied Materials. And I am travelling to Asia probably every other week now, meeting with a lot of customers. We still see tremendous pull from customers as these are the strategic issues, strategic inflections that are facing our customers and we see very strong pull and still confident in our ability to grow the company. And certainly we also see a great opportunity in the combination with Tokyo Electron to accelerate our products and the combination again we believe will help us address these key material innovation challenges for customers that are the key strategic issue for this industry. 
Bob Halliday:  Yes, Tim, maybe I can jump in this one a little bit. I mean there is, the theory put forth that customers might be concerned about that but if you look at the track record, Gary and I have together for 10 years and Gary for 18 years before at KLA. We believe the win-win for customers and ourselves is to aggressively invest into new products which really help them get to the next device and help yield nice performance, and that’s the win-win. So, if you look at [vary] where we went from 30% margin to 75%, it was because we got better solutions. If you look at Applied, what we are doing are aggressively putting money in to products, technical resources in the field and that’s to help the customer. So, there is a long body of evidence that’s our track that help customers do better job with their devices.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus:  Thank you very much and also congrats on the quarter and the outlook. Maybe a first question on, in terms of the EUV story out there, with further delays that are likely to come on that front, have you revised your etch and deposition market outlooks given that you are going to see increased double and multiple patterning techniques?
Gary Dickerson:  Well, I think definitely that provides a growth opportunity and as I talked about earlier, we are gaining share in etch especially in foundry and in the NAND business. So, we have really good momentum there. We are seeing strong pull from customers also in the deposition area. Hardmask is an area where we have a pretty strong position and then we have new technologies some that we talked about around selective material removal and some other areas that are coming out of the technology pipeline that also create opportunities for us. So, absolutely we look at this as a good opportunity for Applied.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And maybe just a question on the memory side, on the NAND side, customers have to make that difficult choice between migrating on the planar side or transitioning to 3D NAND, how are you guys helping them along in that transition and what are customers doing in terms of making that challenging decision of expanding the current technology versus going full tilt into 3D NAND?
Gary Dickerson:  Yes, all of the customers are very focused on trying to make this transition from planar to 3D because it is compelling. If you look at the big growth opportunity in the transition from planar to 3D NAND, that is a big focus for all of our customers. As we talk about first generation, so you have a certain number of layers that you are building up when you go to 3D NAND. That first generation for us, we see about 25% increase in our total available market and we’re also gaining share in the initial customers that are transitioning into 3D NAND. One of the things we talked about at the July 8th Investor Meeting is where are the critical deposition steps, as you are making this transition and we talked about our position in that inflection and that -- we're still pretty much on track Patrick with what we talked about last summer. Certainly the inflection is around thermal deposition and etch, we have some very strong products. That’s where a lot of this investment is going for our customers, very strong pull. The first generation for us is going well and we believe there are more opportunities going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
Terence Whalen - Citi:  This question relates to the timing of completion of the merger. Can you update us on what your expectation is for that time, how that’s changed and what milestones we can look for in the coming couple of quarters. Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: So nothing has really changed relative to what we’ve talked about previously on the economics or the timing of the merger. We’re moving through the regulatory process. We mentioned that we’ll be filing the S4 after we file our 10-Q later this month. So I would say we’re still on track with what we had discussed before mid to late 2014 relative to the approval and the close.
Terence Whalen - Citi: And the switching gears a little bit, I think you mentioned had record revenue levels and current implant and also PVD. Maybe just focusing on EPI and PVD, now that you’ve seen sort of initial installations of 3D NAND and also of FinFET for foundry, what are your expectations for growth of the EPI segment in 2014 and perhaps of PVD as well? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, I think if you look at where the industry is going, the performance gains are really being driven by new material. So if you look at the focus in foundry, it’s how do I add more features, better performance but I also have to have low power and battery life. So what we’re seeing - and the same thing is true again. As you make the change from Planar to 3D NAND, as we talked about is very focused on materials innovation. If you look at future memory devices like MRAM, very PVD intensive type of a process, many new materials. And I really think that these are major changes for the customers, major changes in device architecture, many new materials and we really see that continuing. If you look at where do people go beyond first generation FinFET devices, we really see more EPI steps, more PVD, many new materials, and when I’m talking to the customers, this is the key challenge for them, how do they keep driving Moore’s law and make that cost effective. And materials, if you look at what’s happened with Planar to 3D NAND change, it’s less litho intensive and really focused on materials. We see that trend continuing forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Chin - UBS:  Great, thanks hi Gary and Bob. Nice results off there. My first question was just a follow up on the reported foundry orders in the quarter. It looks like Applied’s orders and foundries was significantly stronger than Tokyo Electron’s reported foundry orders. I was just wondering is that because Applied has this extra month of January in it, in the month of January, it was a very strong foundry order month, or is there something more complex to that?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. We think we’re doing very well as a company with foundries particularly in Taiwan because if you look at what they’re doing Steve, it’s 20 nanometer devices, big spending early part of the year and then later in the year its FinFET. 20 nanometer devices use PVD tools big time for things like Metal Gates, use FE tools big time. So the inflections going on at the foundry play very well to our strains. If you look at PVD, very strong share there, very high share in FE, it’s a growing market. The question we just got asked about FE, everything we see empirically about the FE market is good and the directional element of the FE feels very good. So I think the products we offer and services for foundries are very compelling at this point and I think that helped Applied Materials more than other companies.
Stephen Chin - UBS: And maybe as my follow up question on 3D NAND, maybe you could share some more color on AMAT’s share of etch versus deposition in this 3D versus planar transition unit. It sounds like Applied is doing quite well in etch and 3D NAND. But just curious how -- I guess Applied’s deposition momentum is in 3D NAND. Is it just as many incremental wins as etch? I just couldn’t tell from the color.
Gary Dickerson: Yes, on the 3D NAND I think one thing, if you go back and look at what we discussed at the July 8th meeting. Basically what we did on the deposition side was lay out many of the critical steps across the largest customers and we talked about winning 75% of those steps. We are still very much on track with what we talked about July 8th. We have some very, very good products that provide customers with better device performance and yield and certainly that is a critical element for them as they make this transition. But we also have very good cost of ownership relative to other choices that they could make there. So deposition we looked this year will be very strong for us. PVD, we believe that V-NAND will be strong, additional share gains for us in foundry. So 2014 for the CDD business also will be very strong for us. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with DA Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.
Tom Diffely - DA Davidson:  Maybe another question on that topic. You talked about some nice share gains last year, I’m curious, do they come at the expense of Tokyo Electron.
Bob Halliday:  There’s really very little overlap, if you look at the products that we have, you know TEL is track, batch furnaces, Webclean, there’s really, really very little product overlap between the two companies.
Gary Dickerson:  I can’t think of anything because the only place we normally have similar products is etch and we’re focused on conductor etch, they're in dialectric etch.
Tom Diffely - DA Davidson:  Okay, and I’m wondering if you just give maybe some broad strokes on how you think the TEL market share went last year.
Gary Dickerson:  Oh, we’re two separate companies. We don’t have enough insight into them to comment for them.
Tom Diffely - DA Davidson:  Okay, then finally, you gave us the kicker you got the 25% increase you get going into 3D NAND. Do you have a similar number for going to FinFET, 40-nanometer FinFET?
Gary Dickerson:  It’s a similar number, it’s in the same range. If you look at the transition from 20-A to the FinFET device node, it’s a similar number and as Bob said, as you go beyond even first generation FinFET we’re seeing some really strong pull for more materials innovation, more staffs like FE increasing as you go beyond first generation FinFET.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. 
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Two quick questions. First, Gary you mentioned about a $7 billion in NAND WFE [ph] this year and overall WFE of $31 billion to $34 billion. I’m kind of curious, of that $7 billion how much do you think is 3D NAND, or of the overall $31 billion to $34 billion what percentage of spending is 3D NAND and FinFET, where you’re seeing this technology inflexion.
Gary Dickerson:  What I would say on both of those, if you look at the FinFET investment, a lot of technology buys there, and then you have - certainly technology buys across the board, and the 3D NAND transition from planar. So it’s probably 25% - 30% if you look at both of those technology transitions. It could be higher, depending on the adoption, the rate of adoption, but it’s in that range somewhere. 
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then as a follow up, I have a question on a -- a clarification on the numbers you guys gave in September post the merger. The 17% tax rate post the merger by reincorporating in Netherlands, is that as simple as reincorporating in Netherlands or do you need to ship a certain amount of revenue out of Netherlands or have some employee, a certain number of employees there?
Gary Dickerson:  Mostly incorporating in the Netherlands. 
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So just reincorporating is good enough. You don’t need any revenue out of Netherlands.
Gary Dickerson:  Our substantial operations will not [indiscernible]. 
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. 
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Again going back to the foundry, definitely you reported pretty good numbers, much better than your peers. I’m just trying to understand the linearity of 20-nanometer and 40-nanometer. Since 20-nanometer is going to be a smaller node, is it fair to say that the capacity addition for 20-nanometer is almost complete and the next round of foundry orders will be more along the line of FinFET?
Gary Dickerson:  We still see 20-nanometer being a significant amount of 2014 CapEx. The other thing is that a lot of the tools are similar for 20-nanometer and FinFETs including a lot of the backend lines stuff. 
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: And do you see multiple customers doing 20-nanometer or most customers will focus on 16-14 or FinFET technology and there’s going to be just one customer on 20-nanometer.
Gary Dickerson:  You know, as Bob said, typically what happens is that customers buy the tools for multiple technology nodes. So when they’re buying for 20-nanometer, some of those tools are also going to be used as they go forward in FinFET. Some will stay at the previous technology node. But we don’t really see significant production buys only for FinFET technologies in 2014. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: So, on the WFE [ph] outlook for top 10 % to 20%, I felt that [indiscernible] high obviously with early on the year but Bob or Gary, what do you think will drive the upside, downside? Is it broadening all customer or is it specific if you pick a project that might not happen or happen this year? How do you kind think about potential upside or downside to that range?
Bob Halliday: Upside downside on the -- Gary can answer little bit. I think, I will give you the characteristics, then the potential upside downside. The characteristics of the headwind as I said earlier are, the spending is a little bit more diverse. So you’ve got more foundry customers spending, some more memory customers spending money. So that’s a good thing and some of those people not all have the same technology inflections. So that diversity gives a little bit incremental confidence. Second is the other big thing going on this year is the technology inflection between planar NAND and VNAND and between 20-nanometer and FinFET. That’s what I was debating. We see a lot of push for those. What would make the year bigger, I don’t know. If there was a bigger production buys of 20-nanometer or earlier production with the FinFET. So that would be foundry issues. Now, I do think the spread out to multiple foundry customers gives you a little bit of cushion on the volatility. The second on VNAND, I think it’s going to be a pretty good NAND year. We see it in planar entry there. The rate of transition from one to the other, it’s little hard to predict. What I will say is common to both FinFET and VNAND. If you look at the device benefits of VNAND long term very, 3D VNAND very compelling, FinFET very compelling. So there is a lot of incentive to customers to quickly push to those for the absolute device benefits and the competitive benefits. Those things would make you feel little bit more optimistic that spending will be good.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: And then I guess one question I have on Tokyo Electron merger. I think you guys talked about the benefit including some synergies, especially on the revenue side synergy. I was wondering how do we kind of think about that? Is this something that we should kind of think about or the technical synergy you can get and therefore those will start to drive incremental revenue that we should expect and obviously the merge is done immediately in 2015 or is there something the technical synergy will eventually lead to newer product or better product and as we know in semi space it takes one or two years just to get the product into the customer hand and get the qualifying ramp? How do you kind of think about the timing of those revenue synergies income?
Bob Halliday: That’s a good question. There is a limited amount that we can do right now relative to really understanding a lot of details around the technology synergies between the two companies. But I what I would say is that the big challenge facing the industry, as I’ve talked about before is material innovation. Materials innovation is really driving performance gains in logic and memory. And we really think that will increase in importance going forward. Really innovation is also connecting dots and to the extent that Powell has some very good complementary technologies that we can work together in providing new solutions -- we do think there is a real opportunity there and this is the strategic issue facing the industry is how fast do we make these technology transitions into the new devices. You see it today with FinFET and 3D NAND being really difficult challenges. So we’re pretty excited. As I talked about earlier, the interaction we’ve had with the TEL people so far has been very positive, very enthusiastic. We would love to get working on those technology synergies and so we’re looking forward to the close and we can start getting into more detail.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Chad Dillon - Deutsche Bank: This is Chad Dillon on the line for Vishal. You've been very focused on gaining share in the inspection market over the past year. So I was hoping you could discuss where you think your share is at 20 nanometer, and how it compares to 28 at this stage of a new node ramp?
Gary Dickerson: So we have very, very strong pull from customers. As we’ve talked about earlier we’re making investments both in terms of product development and also in terms of application support. We’ve had a lot of momentum in foundry and logic. As we talked about we had record inspection sales in the last calendar year. And we have a very strong position in e-beam review. And that business is pretty sizable and we’re really extending our leadership in e-beam review, pretty much across the board at all of the different customers. In the foundry business, the momentum there has been very good. That is part of what’s contributing to our record in the foundry in the last quarter. The layer penetration for us is increasing as over the last year, really across the board we also talked about in logic having a customer adopting the UVision 6 for their most advanced technology node. So we’re pretty optimistic.
Chad Dillon - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And then as you progress through 2014, what’s your expectations for the first half, second half mix of WFE spending if you break it down between memory versus foundry/logic?
Gary Dickerson: So we have two questions then; wafer fab equipment spending first half, second half -- and the second is the breakdown between them. So if you look at I think the halves in total are pretty equal in terms of the mix -- pretty equal to -- you have inflections going on, that makes it a little harder to predict. So we think that the foundry could be pretty strong in the back until we get either 20-nanometer that have some legs or FinFET to come in. So we’re looking at both to be pretty even through the year. Maybe getting DRAM is a little bit heavy on the front end.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna: Yes. I have two questions, one for Bob. Going back to slide that you have first announcement of for the Tokyo Electron merger, the 240 earning based on $37 billion WFE. How should I think about the stability of the model with different scenarios in case or worst case scenario we don’t hit the $37 billion of WFE?
Bob Halliday: That’s a good question Mehdi. If you go back to the Analyst Day at July 8th, we put a couple of different models up for 2016 for Applied Materials. We had a $37 billion model which was 25.6% of operating margins and a $30 billion model which I think is about 22%, 23% I don’t know, it was in the low 20s, a little less couple of points less. And then models weren’t as important to me as what the message was. The message was we are not running the company into a $37 billion wafer fab equipment number. We are managing Applied and we’re going to manage the combined company to a reasonable sort of mid-cycle number of around $28 billion to $30 billion. Our cost structures would be built around that, our investments would be built around that, our flexibility would be built around that. That’s how we will manage the company. We’ve had good alignment with Tokyo Electron that they agree that’s a good way to manage a company in this industry. And if we can do that and achieve low 20s and $30 billion and wafer fab equipment I think you’ll have great confidence that if $37 billion happens we’ll hit our model.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna: Okay. And then one clarification question for Gary. During your last conference call you told us that in the area of 3D NAND opportunities per wafer start would increase by 30%. And I’m assuming the TEL opportunity. And today you’re talking about 25% increase. What am I missing here?
Gary Dickerson: Well, so there is really a range in terms of how much the CapEx increases for us. There is first generation versus second generation 3D NAND. It’s in the range on a first generation in 25%-30%. These are -- it's difficult to call that closely in terms of what that exact number is on the first generation but it’s pretty significant. If you look at some areas, some areas are up more than 50%, some specific markets for us are up significant amount. But the first generation is in that range and of course as you know, they are going to keep going vertical to drive this scaling beyond the first generation. So the increase there is more. So it’s really the starting point and sometimes people will talk about 3D NAND overall. We’re trying to be specific around first generation, what that number will look like.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna: Can I ask you a follow up?
Gary Dickerson: Sure. Go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna: I’m little bit confused because I understand the number of statutory is up, the number of the steps goes up, obviously the capital intensity is going up. But we were in Phoenix this past Friday and one of the memory manufacturer with the goal of having 3D private line sometimes in the next 24 months is also talking about very proven CapEx, capital intensity actually going down in fiscal year ’15. So help me reconcile the two different messages from your customers and from equipment suppliers. What am I missing here? They’re talking about capital intensity on the management going down and after 2014 but equipment industry is seeing something different.
Bob Halliday: Let me take a shot and then Gary will give you better answer. I get asked this question in a reasonable amount. I get asked the questions well, it was one of the companies that talked about overall capital intensity going up, number one and number two, they’re doing their overall turn. So the first question I typically get asked is overall. Well you got to look at the mix. Now if you go look within foundry, within NAND, within DRAM and Logic and let’s pick foundry where we talk a lot about the biggest part of the share, I don’t think anyone doubts capital intensity is going up. If you go look at how much it costs to build a 50,000 wafer fab equipment, the cost is gone up. So within that segment it’s gone up. If you look at Logic it’s got more expensive and where you’d have to parse [indiscernible] is Greenfield versus reuse and reuse is a bigger issue than Logic. If you look at VNAND, it’s going up for first generation in total but it’s very much going up where we play which is deposition, etch and thermal. If you look at lithography which has been really driving the cost bus for NAND in the last number of years is going down. The next generation VNAND is probably 50 nanometer target versus 10 nanometer. So it’s reuse through existing lithography. So they can be very prudent in NAND, in that total CapEx because the big cost of lithography has been eased. What they doing is it’s much more cost effective for them to use things like etch, deposition and thermal. I think then when you go to DRAM which is the final market, the cost has been moderate but the cost has been somewhat obscured because you haven’t had lot of new Greenfield. So measurements were a little bit harder. As you look at next generation the capital intensive -- entry of a new DRAM fab is going up some, particularly because the periphery is becoming more logical, like it will fall to same capital intensity that foundry and logic have. So, I think you go look in the mix between -- next featuring Greenfield and reuse and then you will look at the mix within equipment type. And I think those things are consistent with what we’ve said, particularly the NAND question you asked.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, thanks, Mattie. And I know we are running a little bit over but if we have one more on the line we will go ahead and please try to help.
Operator:  Yes sir, your final question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Northland Capital. Please go ahead with your question. 
Ben Pang - Northland Capital:  Thank you for squeezing me in. First on the etch share gain, you commented on 5% share gain and kind of concentration on conductor etch. Does that imply your conductor share gain is like 10%?
Bob Halliday:  Yes, I think if you do the math that’s pretty close.
Ben Pang - Northland Capital:  Okay. And then in terms of your wafer fab equipment outlook, a lot of technology transition et cetera and kind of broadening of the base. Does that imply that the spend is going to be I guess less tied to the utilization rates and kind of the end demand for semiconductor this year?
Gary Dickerson:  I’m sorry Ben. I lost you on that one. The voice faded for on me a second. Could you just quickly repeat it?
Ben Pang - Northland Capital:  I guess the base case for semiconductor growth in the high single-digit type situation and your utilization rates are kind of not great right now. Do you see a big impact to the pattern of wafer fab equipment spending this year on those type of dynamics. Since it’s mostly technology transition I would assume that it doesn’t matter whether the utilization rates move up and down a little bit or the semiconductor demand get cuddled but. That might not actually impact the spending on the technology transition. Is that the right way you guys are actually try think about this?
Gary Dickerson:  Well, it was probably somewhere in the middle, I think there is a lot of majority in there to what you say because in foundry big technology inflections spreading out to multiple customers. So, I think there is going to be substitute spending driven by capacity but also technology. I think DRAM, when you see DRAM prices pretty good, it would imply, you might have a little upside because utilizations probably run pretty, if you remember they had that fire in China last year at Hynix too. So, DRAM might play for you actually. FLASH, you got to sort through how much capacity is there between planar and VNAND and how much will that might increase their sales because it’s got better endurance reliability, they may increase their addressable market for FLASH. So, the short answer to your question is I think you’re probably right and I think the trends are okay on that.
Michael Sullivan:  Thank you, Ben for your question. And we’d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator:  Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Applied Materials’ Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, November 14, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Rachel. Today, we will discuss the results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year ending October 27. Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO and Bob Halliday, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that today’s call will also contain forward-looking statements including those that our announced business combination with Tokyo Electron and our current view of Applied markets, operational improvements, products, share positions, profitability, growth targets and Q1 business outlook. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied and it should be interpreted in that light. Information concerning the risk factors is contained in our company’s SEC filings including our most recent Form 10-Q. These are our expectations as of today and we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements. Today’s call also includes non-GAAP adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today’s earnings press release and in our earnings summary presentation, both of which are available on our IR website at appliedmaterials.com. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.
Gary Dickerson : Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. At the end of September, we announced that Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron are combining to create a new global innovator for the semiconductor and display industries. This merger will enable us to accelerate the strategic visions of our two companies and to accelerate our momentum for profitable growth. We will bring together complementary leading technologies and products to create an expanded set of capabilities in precision materials engineering and patterning to solve our customers’ high-value problems better, faster and at lower cost. Since the announcement, we have started integration planning and we are pleased with the constructive engagement. We’ve also been meeting with our customers to discuss the specific ways the merger will create value for them and their responses have been positive and supportive. We expect to file our S4 securities registration statement in January which will provide you with additional information, and we remain confident that we will receive approval for the merger in the mid to second half of 2014. The rest of today's call will focus on Applied Materials’ quarterly and year end results, as well as our outlook. In the fourth quarter, Applied delivered earnings toward the high-end of our range and we entered our new fiscal year with momentum in bookings and new product penetration. I would like to thank all our employees for their contributions over the past year. This is a team with tremendous passion to create value for customers and investors. I would also like to thank Mike Splinter whose leadership, guidance and support enabled a seamless CEO transition. Mike and I will continue to work closely as we plan and implement the integration with Tokyo Electron. 2013 was a transformative year for Applied Materials – a year of building momentum for profitable growth. First, focused our growth strategy and investments on leveraging our precision material engineering leadership to enable major technology transitions for our customers. As part of this focused strategy, we increased annual run rate investment in 300 mm product development by more than $200 million. Second, we took steps to shape a more competitive company. We reduced overhead spending by $130 million through efficiency improvement in corporate functions and made significant additional reductions in solar operating expenses. We strengthened the organization in many critical areas, attracting top technical talent in edge and inspection and other group, while adding new leadership in solar and display, finance, operations, marketing and strategy. We introduced a new operating rhythm and strengthened our business processes to improve execution and enable Applied to effectively scale as we drive profitable growth. Third, we build positive momentum in our growth businesses, including etch, inspection and display. Fourth and most significantly, major industry trends are feeling positive momentum for our leadership businesses. Our Precision Materials Engineering technology is enabling key inflections in the mobility war, by providing our customers with solutions that improve device performance and yield. With smartphone sales expected to exceed 1 billion units this year, the mobility trend remains the main growth driver for the electronics industry. Smartphones and tablets now generate more semiconductor and display revenue than all other category -- categories of consumer electronics combined. We estimate that our customers will need to add manufacturing capacity for more than 500 million incremental smartphone and tablet units in the next two years. Demand for advanced mobileship is fueling strong foundry investment in leading-edge processes as they build out 20-nanometer and raise to be first with FinFET technology. Mobility is also a driver for NAND flash and when combined with a stronger adoption of solid-state drives, bit growth remains in the 40% to 50% range. We expect investment to grow by more than 30% in 2014, with incremental spending in advanced planar NAND and strong spending for 3D NAND. DRAM content and smartphones is approximately doubling with each generation, boosting consumption of mobile DRAM. Prices have risen more than 120% over the past year and due to supply constraints that we expect to extend until mid-2014, there is a good foundation for new capacity investments. Based on these factors, we are maintaining our view that wafer fab equipment spending for calendar 2013 will be in the range of $27 billion to $30 billion. As we are at the beginning of major technology transitions driven by FinFET and 3D NAND, we believe wafer fab equipment investment will be higher in 2014, up 10% to 20%. We expect to see a year-over-year increase in foundry, NAND and DRAM investment with logic and other spending flat to down. In Display, TV unit growth is being impacted by the elimination of subsidies in China. However, this is being offset by global demand for larger TVs, shipments of 50-inch and bigger screens are up nearly 70% year-on-year and this is driving area growth of around 10%, which is not to sustain healthy investment levels. In Mobile, new display technology is being adopted. The use of low temperature polysilicon backplane enables higher resolution and lower power consumption, and is migrating from smartphones to tablets. In addition, smartphones with curved OLED flexible displays are starting to appear. These trends are very positive for Applied as LTPS, OLED and flexible display technologies increase the total available market for our large area, precision materials engineering equipment by more than 30%. As we outlined in our July Analyst Meeting, customers are locked in a battle for mobility leadership and this is driving major technology inflections in transistor, interconnect, memory, patterning and display. Materials innovation and cost effective scaling are driving performance gains for our customers and are increasingly enabled by Applied’s strength in precision materials engineering. In foundry, transistor performance remains a critical focus and we have very strong pull for collaboration in this area. As customer’s buildout High-k Metal Gate capacity, we are increasing our share of their spending through a combination of expanded market opportunity and new positional wins. As a result, we anticipate that we will grow our PVD share more than 5 points in 2013, as well as making significant gains in CMP. The next battleground for foundry is FinFET and customers are pushing hard to begin pilot production in 2014. Our strong position in the critical transistor technologies, including Fe implant, ZnO [ph] and CMP provides us with a platform for further share gains at this inflection. In memory, technology trends also played to our strengths. And with the transition from planar to 3D NAND, we see our opportunity per wafer start increasing by more than 30%. In addition to market expansion, we are also winning share in 3D NAND as leading customers select our differentiated solutions for high aspect ratio edge and critical deposition process steps. In recent weeks, we secured a major win in staircase deposition applications at one of our largest memory customers. In the past year, we’ve started to demonstrate excellent progress beyond our traditional leadership areas. Our Process Diagnostics and Control group grew 20% relative to 2012 and our UVision brightfield inspection product line delivered record net sales for the year. Overall we believe we will gain over four points of inspection share in 2013 and we are in a strong position with the leading companies as they ramp next-generation thin fab devices. In edge, our focus strategy is yielding results and we're gaining share based on the new conductor expositions we have secured. In display, equipment demand rebounded in 2013 and more importantly we were able to significantly outgrow the market. We expect to gain more than 20 points of PVD share this year while holding position in CVD where we are already very strong. In summary, fiscal 2013 was the year when we built momentum for profitable growth and made Applied Materials more competitive. Today we have positive momentum in our markets as major trends play to our strengths and we have a very strong pipeline of differentiated product to grow our wafer fab equipment share and enter new markets. We have positive momentum with customers and a strong pull for earlier router and deeper collaboration to enable their future devices with our materials engineering solutions. We also have positive momentum with employees. Our engagement cores are at an all-time high and we were adding very strong talent in critical areas to improve execution and enable us to successfully integrate with Tokyo Electron. As we look to 2014 we are very excited. We have great opportunity to accelerate our momentum for profitable growth, and we remain highly focused on execution to ensure we take full advantage of these opportunities. Now Bob will provide additional details about our performance and outlook.
Bob Halliday: Thanks, Gary. In the fourth quarter, our orders grew sequentially and revenue was in line with our expectation. We maintained our spending discipline in the quarter which helped us to achieve EPS in the upper end of the guidance range. We entered fiscal 2014 with momentum, especially on both orders and revenue for SSG. Since this is our Q4 report, I'll make some observations about fiscal 2013. We have been transforming the financial profile of the company by one, aggressively reallocating our spending priorities; two, increasing the funding and velocity of new and disruptive products; and three, strengthening our gross margin performance even as we introduce new products. Beginning with spending, we have reallocated dollars from solar to semi and from overhead to products. For example, we reduced solar spending by about $120 million in 2013, and we shifted that spending plus another $40 million in overhead savings to R&D programs within SSG. For the year, we grew R&D as a percentage of R&D plus SG&A by 6 points from about 54% in 2012, to nearly 60% in 2013. To help fund increase we reduced our overall G&A spending by $130 million or 22% over the same period. These are major changes to our organization. Now let me give you some insight into how we’re deploying these additional dollars to strengthen our technology and product pipeline, especially in disruptive products, which are a key driver of future profitable growth. In 2013, we moved over two-thirds of the incremental R&D investment into disruptive products. These are new products such as selective material removal to give our customers new ways of solving high-value problems. Disruptive products expand our addressable market and give us the chance to change the market share landscape. A good indicator of our progress is evaluation tools shipments, which are projected to increase significantly in Q1 of 2014. For our customers, cleanroom space and engineering expertise are precious resources and a stronghold for more of our evaluation tools speaks to the value of our latest products. Another example of our progress is our manufacturing pilot line in Santa Clara. With this new capability, along with other changes, we will reduce our deployment cycle time by approximately four months and significantly improve our initial product. Another key indicator of progress is that we're beginning to see these disruptive products in our backlog in both SSG and display. We expect this investment in faster development of new and its disruptive products to increase our market share and operating leverage. In 2013, we gain market share with many of our existing products by improving our customer responsiveness and application footprint. We’re getting more traction with our customers particularly with those that are pushing their leading edge in logic, foundry and 3D NAND. Our orders from the leading foundry customer was the highest in Applied’s history this year and we expect our strong SSG order momentum to continue into 2014 in foundry and overall. Now I would like to give you some background on our gross margin performance. In 2013, while our overall revenue was down 14%, we increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 120 basis points. The mix between our segments was beneficial in 2013 as solar declined and semi, display and AGS, all increased as a percentage of our revenue. We see this segment mix benefit continuing in 2014, which should be a strong year for us in semi. Now let me give you some color on our non-GAAP gross margins within each of our segments for 2013. In SSG, we maintained our gross margins during the year in which we penetrated new markets. In display, we gained share and improved our gross margins. In AGS, gross margins were flat, excluding the impact of a PV solar line sale in 2012. In EES, gross margin improved despite a weak year for solar demand. Although it is still early to make precise forecast we currently project, our non-GAAP gross margin to be up sequentially in Q1 of 2014 down slightly in Q2 and up again in Q3 and Q4. Overall we expect our product and customer mix to become more favorable as we proceed through the year. We also have initiatives underway to lower our material costs and higher volume for the year will help the absorption of our fixed costs. Our goal for 2014 is to once again deliver over a point of non-GAAP gross margin improvement for the year even as we ramp new products. Next, I’ll summarize our fourth quarter results and comment on changes in the prior quarter. Orders were approximately $2 billion, up 5% sequentially on higher orders in SSG, AGS and EES, offset by a decline in display. Net sales were approximately $2 billion in line with our expectations. Our non-GAAP EPS is $0.19 in the upper end of the guidance range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 42%, down about a point due in part to items in AGS and display that I'll touch on in a moment. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $512 million which was a bit below our guidance. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.8% for the quarter and 24.5% for the year. We expect the rate to be approximately 23% for the first quarter. Cash from operations was $19 million driven by increased working capital requirements. Our shipments were weighted to latter half of the quarter, resulting in higher accounts receivable and inventories grew to support Q1 projected customer demand. We returned $167 million to stockholders in Q4, paying $120 million in dividends and using $47 million to repurchase 3 million shares. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximate $2.9 billion. Next, I will comment on our Q4 segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were up 16% to $1.4 billion, with growth in foundry, NAND and Logic and the decline in DRAM. SSG net sales declined slightly to $1.2 million in line with guidance with increases in Logic and DRAM, offsetting a seasonal decline in foundry. SSG’s non-GAAP operating margin decreased slightly to 20.8%, reflecting higher investments in new product development. In AGS, orders were up 6% to $548 million and included several large contract renewals, which tend to be higher in our Q4. AGS net sales were up 8% to $538 million, which is a bit better than our expectation due to higher than expected equipment sales. AGS non-GAAP operating margin declined to 21.6%. We recorded a $20 million charge for customs duty assessment that we hope to recover in the future. Our display orders decreased 55% to $114 million. We expect orders to be higher in Q1 and we expect the overall TV and mobility investment cycle to continue in 2014. Display net sales were flat at $163 million. The non-GAAP operating margin declined by about 9 points to 12.3%, reflecting a $10 million inventory charge. EES orders increased to $40 million and net sales were approximately flat at $44 million. EES non-GAAP operating loss was $22 million. We will continue to look for opportunities to lower EES spending in Q1 [ph]. Now I will provide our Q1 business outlook. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 3% to 10%. Within this outlook we expect SSG net sales to be up by 15% to 20%. AGS net sales should be down 5% to 10%. AGS revenues tend to be seasonally lower in Q1. We expect display net sales to be down 15% to 30%. And EES net sales should be approximately flat. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $540 million plus or minus $10 million. Many of our groups will observe a two-week holiday shutdown, which will save us approximately $10 million in the quarter. We expect non-GAAP earnings-per-share to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.24. In summary, 2013 was a transformative year for Applied Materials, and we anticipate that 2014 will be a strong year for the company and the industry. We entered our new year with increasing customer and product momentum. We're excited about our plan combination with Tokyo Electron, which will accelerate our strategy, increase our profitability and provide strong cash returns to our holders. Now let me turn the call over to Mike Sullivan for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Bob. As a reminder, today’s call will be focused on Applied’s business and financials and we do look forward to providing you with more information about the planned combination with Tokyo Electron over time. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Rachel, let’s please begin.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Bob, last week [ph] where you guys talked about a specific increase in eval tools over two quarter period of I believe 20%. This quarter you are just talking about a significant increase sequentially in the January quarter. I am kind of curious relative to that initial target, are you getting close to that 20% increase over two quarters? Or is there something about the tail proposed merger which is slowing the rate of eval for you guys in the field?
Bob Halliday: Actually I think the eval number is going to be bigger than 20% -- it’s bigger than that number, but we just didn’t put a number in here today.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: As my follow up real quick, Bob, appreciate kind of the quarterly progression of gross margins for the fiscal year. I am curious, is that all being driven by mix as you gain market share in new segments at perhaps lower gross margin, or do you think as you go throughout the year even with those share gains you should be able to bring margins up in some of the new markets you are penetrating.
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. I intentionally, John, I intentionally gave everybody some guidance by quarter because there are so many moving pieces here that want to try and help. Last quarter, if you remember I voice some conservatism about the Q1 gross margins. I looked ahead at quarter and in fact if you look at what we are saying today is probably a little bit more optimistic than the street interpreted last quarter. In fact, even I thought we saw a little bit better. So, a lot of mix things going on here. So if you look Q1, probably a little bit better than people thought last quarter and even I thought down little bit from this third -- up a little bit actually from this quarter, but not quite as conservative as I thought last quarter. As you look to Q2, I project the mix to be a little bit negative. I project, as we go through the year, Q3 and Q4, the product and customer mix should be more positive and I project some of the material costs and absorption to be more positive later in the year. Additionally, the question you ask about new product penetrations, we are pretty optimistic that the new product penetration including the disruptive ones in the evals and the customer engagement, those are not big levers in terms of the gross margins this year. I think we are more enthusiastic both some of the leading indicators of share gains.
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Bob, two questions. First, your silicon revenues essentially were flat year-over-year, if I take your guidance of what you have given for the calendar -- I mean for the January quarter. So, if WFE is going to be up somewhere in the vicinity of 10% to 20% for next year, can we expect some significant outperformance given the share gains that you've been talking about for next year?
Bob Halliday: Yeah, Jagdish, we think -- overall, environment next year, wafer fab equipment is pretty good. We also think we’ll do well next year. We don’t project that far advance at this point, but we are getting some good penetrations. We think we gained share in some significant markets in 2013. And we see momentum continue into 2014. But we have a projected four year ‘14 share in revenue. But we think we have a pretty good momentum.
Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray: Okay. And just a question for Gary -- Gary, you had made in prepared remarks about penetration in etch, particularly with regard to NAND customers I guess 3D NAND. So, I just wanted to get a sense from you, how much -- what kind of magnitude are we thinking about and how much is the proliferation going to be for other 3D NAND customers. Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: We definitely are making progress in etch this year. We really have strengthened the team, focused the strategy in the areas where we have good opportunities. And we anticipate that we will gain somewhere around five points of share overall in etch. In 2013, really focused in conductor etch and that is in, certainly planar and 3D NAND where we are making a lot of progress and also in foundry. Thos are the key areas. In addition, we have some strong technology around inflections for our customers and we are getting good pull in those areas also.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just follow-up on your comment from orders. You said DRAM orders were down sequentially in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what’s going on there? It sounds like the supply constraints should continue next year and you are pretty positive about DRAMs trending into 2014? How should we think about the order pattern in DRAM, as well as some of the other NAND and logic customers into 2014? Thank you.
Gary Dickerson: The overall orders, which were up and where we said DRAM was down. We said the others were up and I think we alluded to the fact we feel pretty strongly about orders into the near term, particularly in foundry and places like that. I know a lot of people have commented in the public domain that this information at a very large foundry, we did remarkably well in the last few months. We don't dispute that notion that’s out there in the public domain. Some of that we think falls into our Q1, so we see fair amount of momentum for ourselves, particularly at leading-edge customers. We do think DRAM, which we mentioned on the phone, not too much momentum right now in the marketplace. So we feel good about foundry, particularly for Applied. We feel NAND looks pretty good, particularly for Applied. In DRAM, we are little more conservative frankly.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Just a follow-up on the solar segment. You saw some improvement in orders, but the segment is still losing money, you said you're going to try to reduce spending there in 2014. Are you seeing any change at all in terms of fundamentals in orders from your customers? Do you have any plans to invest in that business so you're still looking to find ways to optimize that business?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, in solar as we mentioned, we've reduced the operating expenses in the last year by about $120 million. Certainly our goal is to -- while we're in this period of time where the demand is soft, continue to reduce the earnings drag and we see additional opportunities to do that. There is some incremental improvement, we see a couple of opportunities that could get us much closer to breakeven in the EES businesses in 2014. But really we think 2014 is going to remain relatively soft in EES overall, and we continue to look for ways to cut cost. As I talked about in the last earnings call, we set a hurdle relative to the operating profit and ROI in each one of the businesses, and we continually evaluate all of the different businesses against that criteria and make decisions that are appropriate based on that information.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen from Citi.
Terence Whalen – Citigroup: Actually a couple of regional questions. If I look at your order pattern by region, we saw a pretty meaningful decline in Japanese orders in the fiscal fourth quarter. I was wondering given that there has been some DRAM fire in Japan, I was wondering, do you expect future orders to come in future quarters because of that disruption in the DRAM? Thanks.
Gary Dickerson : Well, DRAM what we believe is that we'll be somewhat higher. There's some strength in mobile DRAM and as you said, there's some capacity that was taken offline that will provide some incremental lift in the DRAM business. We really don't expect to see that to be a significant change in 2014. We see stronger incremental business in NAND flash, both in planar and the first factory ramping 3D NAND, so that we think will be stronger. And we see incremental CapEx in foundry. Also, DRAM, we think will be up slightly in 2014, but not a significant amount.
Terence Whalen – Citigroup: Terrific. Kind of switching gears to Taiwan, obviously you're now in sort of middle phases of a pretty large order ramp in Taiwan. In terms of your experience last year thinking about the seasonality of orders, are you confident that after the fiscal first and second quarters there are enough positive offsets in foundry and logic to compensate for the sort of more pronounced seasonality that we are again seeing this year from Taiwan?
Gary Dickerson: Yes. I think that – again if we look at the market overall in 2014, as I mentioned we think NAND will be up both in planar and 3D NAND. Foundry -- the ramp in 20-nanometer we think will be pretty significant in 2014 and there is a big focus for all of the foundries to move to FinFET technology as quickly as possible. So we see incremental spending there from the foundries in Taiwan and elsewhere on that technology transition in FinFET. So overall, we think the foundry spending will also be up in 2014. And then relative to your question on the seasonality, certainly we have seen that pattern over the last couple of years, relative first half, second half. We really are not making any forecast right now relative to first half and second half of 2014.
Operator: Your next question is from Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company : Bob, numbers don't always relate perfectly with the MOP’s filings that are filed by one of your big customers in the foundry space. But they announced that there was $900 million worth of orders that got filed during your quarter for you and yet you're reporting Taiwan orders of something like 720? Is that just an order timing issues, so we should expect a very strong Taiwan order number for SSG also in January? Thanks.
Bob Halliday: Yeah. I pulled out the historical data, Tim, on that, because I saw that obviously. And what you see is it always -- it doesn’t always tie tightly in the individual quarters, but the partner is usually petty consistent overtime and we remain optimistic about our opportunity there in the next quarter. So I think there is some linkage.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company : Okay. And then just, Bob, you said last quarter you talked about the eval tools and SSG. It seems like they are constraining revenue guidance a bit? So can you give some sense in terms of what the absolute dollar magnitude is that that issue is constraining SSG revenue guidance time?
Bob Halliday: Yeah. I don’t think it’s a big revenue constraint. It’s -- there is mid-level double -- it’s a good number of double-digit tools, right, and the growth is pretty good too. But they are more of leading indicator of share gains than revenue slippage. So I am really happy we are doing them because they are really good indicator of share opportunities, but they are not a big short-term problem for evidence.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen and Company : Okay. Thanks so much.
Bob Halliday: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question is from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. Gary, you talked about 4 points share gain in inspection in this year? Could you give us a little more granularity on that? How much that might be, what you would consider leading-edge versus trailing-edge and what pulls are driving that? Thank you very much.
Gary Dickerson: Thanks. Yeah. So, as I talked about before, we see very, very strong -- continue to see very strong pull from customers in the inspection market, lot of momentum, especially in foundry and logic, layer penetration increasing at 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer. And we also see a very strong position as the customers move to FinFET technology. In the leading FinFET companies the layer penetration for us is increasing, so that -- really the strength is in, the foundry and logic business. There are some areas where the technology is superior to the competitors, especially in some of the patenting types of applications. We have imaging capabilities that really leverage our strengths. So that’s one area that is growing for us and I mentioned in the prepared remarks that our UVision brightfield sales were a record in this last year. We also have a strong position in e-beam technology, the e-beam review business is a few hundred million dollars and we are strengthening our position there. And as customers are moving to the 3D NAND, there is more demand for e-beam types of applications and the defect review. We are actually seeing traction both in foundry and logic with some unique e-beam imaging capability and metrology. So we are seeing some more pull there and e-beam inspection especially in 3D NAND is increasing. That’s a small number for us today, but we see that longer term as they -- as an increasing opportunity.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: That’s terrific. Thank you. Maybe from my follow-up, on the 3D NAND opportunity, obviously there is one big customer that’s been very aggressive early on there, would you expect to see orders from other 3D NAND customers, significant orders from other 3D NAND customers at some point in calendar year 2014 or would it be beyond that in your estimation?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. I think we will see certainly technology buys in 2014. The one customer you mentioned is really has been pretty optimistic relative to the performance of the device. And certainly, all of the customers have that transition on their roadmap and so for the other customers 2014 we would see technology buys not so much high volume production.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you very much, Bob and Gary. I’m looking at the -- your order buy segment for last five years and it looks like NAND that this quarter was, like I would put, if I go just last five years and I assuming that’s a -- that’s a result of increasing content of definite share in 3D NAND, if you can confirm that? And on foundry, your last -- first half of year your run rate was a $1 billion per quarter and we are still only at $650 million and assuming that since you are commenting that foundry will be stronger next year, I would think that the first half of next year will probably grow year-over-year. Is that a fair assumption?
Gary Dickerson: Okay. I will take the NAND question first. So the opportunity for us as I talked about, there are more – there is more dollars per wafer start for us in the transition from planar to 3D NAND. Dep and etch are areas that are good opportunities for us and other areas that are also increasing. CMP steps are increasing in the transition from planar to 3D NAND. There are also EPI steps in 3D NAND and of course, we have a very strong position there. So that's adding incremental opportunity in the transition from planar to 3D NAND. So those are the areas where we see the largest growth. And then the foundry question, what was the foundry question again?
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: The foundry question -- you're indicating that the foundry spending is going to increase next year and if I go look at this year's first half, your order run rate was about $1 billion and you're ending at $650 million. And I would assume that the order run rate in the next fiscal year, which is the current quarter should be increasing beyond $1 billion run rate for you to – foundry to grow in 2014?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, I don't know that we're going to give any specific numbers. What Bob had mentioned is correct, relative to incremental strength and foundry orders in Q1 as many people have reported. There was a question on the call today relative to the orders last quarter that were reported in Taiwan and our numbers being below that. As Bob said, that we think will come into alignment and we look incrementally in Q1 for the orders to be very positive.
Bob Halliday : Yes, we think our Q1 looks pretty good and we think our share looks pretty good there. I haven't projected beyond the first quarter or so, but the visibility in the near term next quarter still looks pretty good.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS : Just a follow-up question on the, I guess, the lower DRAM orders that you're currently seeing. Do you get the sense that this is due to the higher capital intensity of going sub 20 nanometer or is it from lower yields making the larger die sizes for mobile DRAM and maybe you could talk about where you think the DRAM spend will head as you go into 2014?
Bob Halliday : The data we have -- first you asked the qualitative question, then the quantitative question. I'll do the quantitative one first. We see it has the potential to be up year-over-year, but not dramatically up. We see the first part of the years Q1 super, we think it gets a little stronger during the year. We think it is driven more by mobile DRAM. In terms of capital intensity daunting them, I think it's more of a capacity – do they need the capacity and if you read stuff that folks like you even write, they're benefitting from a little bit of pricing improvement now and they seem to be showing more discipline around it than they have historically. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Pacific.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: I was wondering if, maybe you could give us a little bit more color on some of these evaluation tools you're placing and really specifically I'm wondering if some of these are the selective removal products and whether or not you have any new inspection platforms under evaluation?
Gary Dickerson : Well, we definitely have opportunities in selective material removal as we had talked about in the July meeting. That market we believe will grow very significantly over the next few years. We are always introducing new models and new products, including in inspection. We typically won't talk a lot about some of these new tools. What we've been doing is really targeting the high value problems for customers as they're making these technology changes around FinFET, 3D NAND. There are some new areas that we are looking, that we are pursuing that are good opportunities for us long term and not ready to talk about those in detail. It does take time as you know for those new tools to be adopted in the technology roadmap for the customer. So, as Bob said, it’s really a leading indicator of opportunities for us in the future and our $200 million that we are spending in SSG really are focused on these major technology transitions and highest value problems for our customers.
Bob Halliday: I think most of the places, it speculates that we have and we do have them there, so.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Good. That’s helpful. And then just as my follow-up, this is related to OpEx. You mentioned that around $10 million -- the OpEx may have been $10 million higher without the shutdown this quarter, does that mean OpEx goes up another $10 million in the following quarter?
Bob Halliday: Yes, I’ll try to give you color on that. I think this is a little risk it goes up. Here is what’s going on. At the beginning of the calendar year of January 1st, we do our annual raises and reviews for everyone, and then we also accrue the intensive comp a little bit higher rate, so there is a little bit of a step up. I think I referred to that last quarter too on the spending. Now, if you look at structural spending, underpinning that there is a fair amount of continue structural cost savings that were going through. So, I think there is a little opportunity that expenses trend up a little bit in the second quarter, mostly in products again and we are trying to mitigate that. But we continuously tightening our belts but I would say it’s a little bit of upward bound there.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thanks.
Gary Dickerson: Rachel, to the next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First is just a follow-up question on the eval tool. I was wondering, maybe a different way to ask this. Are those eval tools targeting the 26 nanometer in foundry or some of the 3D NAND opportunity? Are they targeting for longer-term opportunities that you expect to be successful for like, ’15, ’16 or beyond?
Gary Dickerson: I think it’s a combination of opportunities in these major technology transitions at 60 nanometer or the first-generation FinFET. There are some opportunities there for us and then also in 3D NAN. I would say that it’s a mix of products that are going into those near-term technologies and also once that we’re looking out further, as there are even bigger changes with new materials that will be necessary for those devices.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: I see. Okay. Great. And then, just I guess a question on kind of the R&D spending right, given that you are working towards a merger with Tokyo Electron, are you guys starting to allocate your R&D spending and kind of look at your product portfolio, and how it could match or potentially match with (inaudible) and shift your R&D dollar in areas that you felt you might get some incremental synergy once the deal was done?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah. You are right. Now, we are separate companies and we are driving -- really no change in our strategy, no change in our investment profile. We really can’t work on a deeper understanding of products, technologies, roadmap, all of those kinds of things until we are together.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I have two of them. One, either for Gary or Bob, can you help us quantify how much more capital intensive or expenses 3D NAND relative to planer NAND for let’s say 10,000 or 100,000 wafer procurement.
Bob Halliday: Well, I’ll tell you, some of the things that are going on there. It’s capital intensity is located in deposition and etch. So, I think our numbers would say like 30% to 50% and increasing capital intensity going from 2D to 3D NAND per deposition and etch. I think our lithography is actually less intensive, because you are going down to 50 nanometer rules, so it’s heavily located in deposition and etch.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. All right. And then a follow up on the…
Bob Halliday: I think the official number we put out a little while ago was 50% from planar to 3D for etch and CVD.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. All right. And then on the 3D NAND, your etch market share gain, is that -- are you guys so close to it or are you splitting it with the planar NAND income and supply?
Gary Dickerson: Yeah -- no definitely, I mean all of these applications, etch or all of these markets, etch and inspection, many, many, many different segments and so the share for us is increasing in the conductor etch types of applications, but there are maybe four different companies, five different companies that are competing for that business.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Bob, maybe first on the global services business, and in the past you talked about some of the opportunities there to improve the margin profile in that business segment. Can you give us what your thoughts are about some of the efforts and measures you're going to take in 2014 to improve that segment?
Bob Halliday : Sure. So we talked about early on the call that the revenues are down a little bit in Q1, which is seasonality. If you look at the gross margin opportunity in AGS, which is our global services, we're optimistic that we can make improvements next year. Some of the improvements are going to be some higher value services but we also think there is an opportunity for cost reduction on materials which will save us some money. So we think we have an opportunity to improve gross margins across services and products. We talked about for the company an overall increase of over 1% on gross margins. Within AGS we see similar kinds of opportunities.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Maybe just going to the display side for a second. You guys have seen the pickup in orders in 2013 which will lead to the revenues. Maybe again Bob, how do you manage the inventory just given that that's a very lumpy business and what gives you confidence that the investment cycle will continue just given some of the lumpiness of that business overall?
Bob Halliday : Sure. If you add up our orders numbers we have reported throughout the year you will see now we have a pretty damn big backlog in display and the lead times in those tools tend to be pretty long, months and months in terms of the lead times to buy the parts and assemble the tools. So you have pretty good visibility into the shipment pattern. Now the risk you have on that tends to be a little bit – they slip it out a little bit. But in terms of the visibility into the shipment plan over the next six months, it's pretty good. The inventory charge we noted on this that was related to a specific type of tool, we are still hopeful that we are going to end up in good territory in those tools. But right now we took the position that it was – we are going to take a reserve against them.
Gary Dickerson : Yes. We found display as we talked about earlier, there are a few things driving the business. One is, the increase in TV sizes that's very positive driver for us and really the new technology in display technology and mobile is also positive with LTPS, OLED, flexible displays. This is really a big part of the battleground for the consumers and we see a lot of technology transitionings happening this Christmas season and then really tremendous focus from very big companies around technology that would be positive for us from a total available market standpoint.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Patrick and Rachel, I think we have time for about two more callers please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Gary, I want to go back to your earlier comment. Your largest 3D NAND customer, was saying last week that China fab is actually a 2D and eventually in the second half of next year, they will convert it to 3D NAND. So, I want to get your overview on what gives you the confidence that today's booking on the NAND is actually 3D, when your customers are saying, it’s more of the conversion when the China fab is up and running on the 2D NAND? I have a follow-up for Bob.
Gary Dickerson : Yes, just based on the conversations we've had with them around very specific applications.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: So are you saying that it is going to be a conversion or do you still think it's going to be a greenfield 3D NAND?
Gary Dickerson : Well, there's some technology that's similar between 2D and 3D, but certainly what we've seen is buying for some applications that are very specific for 3D NAND. So again, what we've heard in talking with the customer is the timeframe in terms of the ramp and that the specific tools that are being purchased for 3D NAND applications are consistent with what we've talked about.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: And the timeframe for the ramp, does it start today or does it start sometime next year?
Gary Dickerson: Yes, I don’t think we want to get into specific details of what customers have told us.
Michael Sullivan: And Mehdi, did you have a follow up for Bob. Mehdi, do you want to follow that up, we’ll be happy to.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Yes, question for Bob, I’m looking at your operating margin for the SSG. Right now, a year or two ago similar revenue run rate was generating about 30% of operating margin, with the structural changes in your cost structure. When do you expect those kind of margins materialize, or is this going to be on pause until the merger is completed?
Bob Halliday: Yes, I think we strive to get higher gross operating margins. Yes, I agree with you. I think right now, we’ve talked a lot about we’ve been reducing costs in overhead areas particularly ones that aren’t in SSG and investing in product development, which is heavily focused in SSG. Those new products have started to come out whether be eval tools or D2R positions as they start to get revenue ramps on those tools. You see our margins dropped too much more effectively. So we see it going up next year with some volume. We see it improving over time as we start to get penetrations and our goal is to be much more similar to what the numbers you’ve referenced. We’ve just done somewhat of an investment mode in R&D in SSG right now and we’re funding that by cutting back all of other places where it’s sold overhead. So I think our overall approach is somewhat balanced right now but in SSG we’re in investment mode right now.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Thanks Mehdi.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P Morgan.
Harlan Sur : Thanks for taking my question. Nice to see the strong foundry order momentum, on the last earnings call you provided a view that by the end of this year that be about 30k foundry wafer starts of capacity at the 20-nanometer node going to over a 100k in 2014. Given your recent discussions with customers in the strong order momentum, have this view changed?
 J.P Morgan: Thanks for taking my question. Nice to see the strong foundry order momentum, on the last earnings call you provided a view that by the end of this year that be about 30k foundry wafer starts of capacity at the 20-nanometer node going to over a 100k in 2014. Given your recent discussions with customers in the strong order momentum, have this view changed?
Gary Dickerson: No.
Bob Halliday: Good answer, Gary.
Harlan Sur : Great.
 J.P Morgan: Great.
Bob Halliday: I think that this is the round.
Harlan Sur : Yes. And then given the increasing complexity of these next-generation manufacturing processes, I think the frustration that we’re hearing from customers, is that their throughput to the fab is now increasing any where from 15% to 30%. And as we know throughput is the key driver of wafer cost. So how is Applied addressing better throughput on the tools and does the upcoming acquisition of TEL enable you to make even further improvements in optimizations on throughput?
 J.P Morgan: Yes. And then given the increasing complexity of these next-generation manufacturing processes, I think the frustration that we’re hearing from customers, is that their throughput to the fab is now increasing any where from 15% to 30%. And as we know throughput is the key driver of wafer cost. So how is Applied addressing better throughput on the tools and does the upcoming acquisition of TEL enable you to make even further improvements in optimizations on throughput?
Gary Dickerson: Well, the first thing really for the customers is to make the technology work and that’s been a huge focus whether its 20-nanometer ramp to get the yield and device performance targets or FinFET technology or the transition from planar to 3D NAND, what I would say is that those technology transitions are very big transitions, many new materials, very difficult for the customers. And so the first thing really in working with them is to hit the device performance targets and those are the things that we’re working on and then after that really it’s -- it's trying to optimize the overall capability of business terms. And we’re certainly working with customers on that too but the key thing is trying to enable these major changes in device performance and yield as they go through the initial stages of these new device technology transitions.
Harlan Sur : Great.
 J.P Morgan: Great.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thanks, Harlan for your question. And we’d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today’s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings presentation, both of which are available on the Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter. 
Mike Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. Before we get to our earnings discussion, I want to make a few comments about the CEO succession plan that we released today. I am very pleased to announce that we have appointed Gary Dickerson, President, CEO, and a Member of the Board of Directors effective September 1. I will be serving as Executive Chairman. And together with the rest of the Board, we will be supporting Gary as he leads our company to execute on our strategy. As President, Gary has proved to be an outstanding leader and partner focusing on Applied on new strategies for profitable growth. Having worked side-by-side with him for more than a year now, I have every confidence that his vision and personal drive will translate into remarkable success in leading Applied Materials as our next CEO. A top responsibility for any Board is to ensure that there is a strong succession plan in place and that the company can affect a smooth leadership transition at the right time. I think we have done a very good job of this at Applied. By making this transition now, Gary will be in position to prepare this year’s annual operating plan, so we can keep up our momentum for profitable growth. As this is my last earnings call as CEO, I’d like to say thank you to all of our investors and analysts for their support of applied materials over the years. So Gary would like to make a comment? 
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Mike. I’m honored and excited to be given the opportunity to lead this great company into the future. On behalf of the execute team employed I would like to thank mike for his decade of service as CEO. Today thanks to Mike’s leadership Applied enjoys a strong foundation than ever before on which to build momentum for profitable growth. I really believe that our opportunities have never been greater and I’m excited to have the chance to lead applied materials into a new era of growth and success. 
Mike Splinter: Thanks Gary and congratulations. Let’s begin our earnings discussion. We’re pleased to report solid financial results for our third fiscal quarter; we delivered earnings at the mid-point of our range with global appetite for mobile devices and larger TVs driving healthy demand for our semi-conductor and display equipment. As we outlined at our recent analyst event across the company we’re building momentum for profitable growth, industry trends and semi-conductor and display flavor applied materials leadership areas and at that same time we’re seeing results from changes to the organization and our spending profile designed to strengthen customer collaborations and speed up product development. We’re increasing investment in 300 millimeter R&D and field technical resources to support our strategic priority of growing shares and wafer fab equipment by winning at market inflections. We’re stepping up our R&D spending to ensure we have the strong product pipeline we need to drive growth, we’re equally focused on reducing operating expenses and organizational complexity to improve profitability. We will provide an update on our progress later on today’s call. As the mobility build-out gathers pace device makers are engaged in a battle for leadership, consumers are making buying decisions based on battery life, features, form factor and visual experience which means that our customers’ ability to deliver winning products requires new device technology at the right yield and cost. Performance improvements in mobile chips and displays are becoming increasingly dependent on materials innovation. Applied is uniquely positioned to enable next generation transistors and interconnects 3D memory and high resolution, low powered displays. In addition to robust demand for mobile devices we’re seeing strength in the TV market and as a result our display business booked it's highest orders in over two years. TV unit sales are growing and average TV sizes are increasing significantly faster than historical trends. We anticipate that an average increase of two inches in 2013 versus a typical annual increase of about a 0.5 an inch. To put this in perspective for every inch of growth one new Gen 8.5 factory is needed to fulfill the incremental area of demand. Now let me turn to our outlook, through the third year in a row seasonal buying patterns are evident as consumers wait for new smartphone and tablet models to be released in the fall, as a result we’re seeing a near term slowdown in investment by our foundry customers as they focus on ramping new capacity installed over the past two quarters. This will deliver product for the holiday season and readying their next generation of technology. We expect investment levels to recover in the fourth calendar quarter. Unit growths of mobile devices is also driving healthy demand for NAND flash memory and bit (ph) growth for 2013 is expected to be in the 40% to 50% range. The transition of 3D NAND technology into production is underway and we expect investment to accelerate in 2014 and 2015 as more manufacturers adopt this technology. In the DRAM market conditions are improving with average selling prices recovering to levels last seen in 2010 as a result of increasing bit (ph) demand for mobile applications combined with structural changes in the market and several years of underinvestment, customers are taking actions to increase bit supply. Today, these investments are primarily focused on technology conversions for the 3X to 2X node. We expect some new capacity will be added if these favorable market conditions continue into 2014. While mobility related demand remains strong, PC sales are still challenged and consequently, we are seeing some minor reductions in logic investment for the year. Looking at industry investment as a whole, while there has been spending mix shifts towards memory in the second half of the year we are maintaining our 2013 wafer fab equipment forecast of $27 billion to $30 billion. We believe that wafer fab equipment investment will be higher in 2014, up 10% to 20% relative to this year. This will be driven primarily by the foundries building out there 20-nanometer node, investment in 3D NAND capacity, and some increase in DRAM spending. This is the spending mix that is favorable for Applied Materials. In summary, the market environment in both semiconductor and display provides a firm foundation for profitable growth. At the same time, major industry trends are playing to Applied Materials strength in Precision Materials Engineering presenting us with an unprecedented number of opportunities. Most importantly, I am confident that we have the right strategy, the right talent, and the right new CEO to take Applied to new levels of performance. Let me now hand the call over to Gary who will provide more details about our strategy and the progress we are making against our goals. Gary? 
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Mike. Today, I will focus on three areas, where we are building momentum for profitable growth. First, we are shaping a more competitive company that can execute better, faster, and at lower cost. Second, the major industry trends translate into positive momentum for our leadership business segments that are enabling the key technology inflections in the mobility war. And finally, we have positive momentum in growth businesses that can drive significant incremental contribution to our financial performance. As Mike discussed, mobility is the major driver in electronics and all our customers want to be the first to introduce new technology that will help them win. Applied capabilities in Precision Materials Engineering are strategically important for our customers. And this has resulted in employing us into much earlier and deeper engagements. Today, our customer relationships have never been better. And this combined with our strong pipeline of new products is providing us with significant opportunities to grow market share as new transistor, interconnect, memory and display technologies are adopted. To realize these great opportunities, we are making changes to execute better, faster and at lower cost. We have added very strong talent in management, product development, and the field. We have been implementing changes in our structure and business processes to improve the speed and quality of our execution. We have been increasing R&D for products that can drive future profitable growth. R&D spending as a percentage of combined R&D plus SG&A has increased from 55% a year ago to 62% today. In line with our strategic priorities, we have increased focus on our semiconductor business. By shifting overhead dollars, managing our product portfolio, and improving productivity, we increased our annualized funding for 300 millimeter R&D and field support by almost $170 million since the start of the fiscal year. All these actions are enabling us to create a pipeline of new highly differentiated products that have significant pull from the industry technology leaders and will drive future profitable growth in our leadership areas and in other markets, where we have a lot of room to grow our share and profit. Our customers were for mobility leadership is intensifying and materials innovation is their most significant levered to drive performance gains in transistor, interconnect, memory and display. In foundry the major battle is to introduce new transistor technology to enable enhanced performance and longer battery life for mobile devices, this really plays to the sweet spot of our leadership in EPI, implant, thermal, CVD, PVD and CMP. So selective epitaxy combined with our implant and new technologies improves transistor speed by more than 30% while our integrated PVD Metal Gate delivers a 100x improvement in device leakage and lower power consumption. As a result we expect to gain 5 to 10 points of PVD market share this year. IN CMP we expected gross share about 3 points in 2013 and see future market growth as foundries and 3D NAND customers integrate additional steps. Looking ahead two inflections that will have a positive impact on our business in 2014 are foundries transiting to the 20 nanometer node and first generation 3D NAND, these new devices are very positive for Applied because the performance gains are enabled by our leadership and precision materials engineering. They grow our available market and we are in a strong position to gain share when these new devices ramp into volume manufacturing. As foundries move to 20 nanometer technology Applied served market opportunity grows approximately 25% relative to the 28 nanometer baselines. When transistors are introduced at the 1x node we expect our served market to incrementally grow by an additional 5% to 10%. In memory the 3D NAND inflection also leverages our leadership and precision materials engineering. With the transition from plainer to 3D NAND the performance gains are driven by deposition and etch and as a result we expect our available market to grow by about 25% for first generation 3D NAND devices. Another positive trend in 3D NAND is the adoption of EPI and thermal products, two areas where we have clear and sustainable differentiation. Overall we have a strong position in 3D NAND and anticipate our served market and share will grow as these factories ramp into volume production. We’re also building momentum in additional segments including etch, inspection and display. We’re focusing on areas where we have strong pull from customers can help enable inflections and have sustainable differentiation. The talent and investment we have added in these areas are resulting in positive market share momentum. In etch our strategy has been to target areas of the market where we believe we have valuable and sustainable differentiation and this has started to yield results. In the quarter we secured important process tool of record positions in memory that provide a platform to drive significant gains in market share this year. In inspection we have been investing an R&D and field technical support enabling us to increase our layer qualification at logic and foundry customers both at 28 and 20 nanometer technologies. We expect to translate these qualifications into shared gains for our Brightfield products this year. Another area where we see positive momentum is display; displays have a huge influence on the desirability of mobile devices affecting user experience, power consumption and form factor. Advanced low temperature polysilicon and metal oxide transistors are being used to deliver high resolution LCD and organic LED displays that consume less power and have new form factors. These high-resolution mobile displays increased the opportunity for our CVD and PVD equipment in this market by more than 30%. In TV, the introduction of 4K ultra-high definition and OLED is driving more complex and capital intensive manufacturing processes. Our differentiated large area, precision deposition equipment, provides device performance and yield advantages. We won 100% of the CVD and PVD business for the last two new TV factories. And we anticipate our overall share in display PVD will increase by about 25% this year. We see a pathway to grow display revenues to $1 billion or more with high operating leverage. In summary, 2013 is shaping up to be a year, where we are building momentum for profitable growth for 2014 and beyond. We are making great progress building a more competitive company that executes better, faster, and at lower cost. We are bringing new talent and investments to key areas while implementing structural and process changes that improve the speed and quality of our execution. We have positive momentum from the major trends in semiconductor and display markets, that plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses and we have positive momentum in edge, inspection, and display that we anticipate will drive incremental contributions to profitable growth. We are very excited about our technology pipeline and laser focused on execution to make sure we take advantage of the great opportunities we have to drive profitable growth. Now, let me hand the call over to Bob. 
Bob Halliday: Thanks, Gary and good afternoon everyone on the call. Before I cover our results for the quarter, I want to reinforce two very important points that Mike and Gary made. One, our leadership in Precision Materials Engineering creates a unique opportunity for us with our customers. And two, we are driving the necessary changes in the organization to capture this opportunity while improving the overall profitability of the company. To fund these changes and improve our profitability, we are significantly reducing the cost of doing business. We are rapidly eliminating organizational complexity and reducing the investment in the areas with lower returns and reallocating these dollars into our product pipeline for the highest value opportunities. We are already seeing the shift in our financials. On a GAAP basis, G&A as a percentage of R&D plus SG&A has decreased from 24.3% a year ago to 21.4% in Q2 to 17.9% in Q3. At the same time, R&D as a percentage of R&D plus SG&A has increased from 54.8% a year ago to 58.5% in Q2 to 61.6% in Q3. The net result is a 4% year-over-year decline in the spending while increasing R&D by 8%. We will see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, but the trends reflect of the systematic reallocation of our spending that is taking place. This reallocation is driving incremental momentum with customers. One simple leading indicator of this momentum is the number of our semiconductor evaluation tools is expected to increase more than 20% in the next two quarters. In addition, a leading indicator of future spending is headcount and our total headcount is down 6% or approximately 900 employees from a year ago with most of that reduction coming out of EES and the corporate functions. The Applied functional organizations are doing a great job of driving these rapid changes. The teams are doing extensive benchmarking, quickly adopting best known methods and working to improve the velocity of the company. I have been really pleased and grateful for everyone’s efforts. The job is getting reallocated into additional R&D investments are going into semiconductor and display. These are business that have high share or they are growing share with strong product pipelines, in SSG we’re extremely well leveraged to the transistor technology inflections occurring over the next few years. It is possible that the great majority of our business units will gain or hold the share. The plan is pretty straightforward, get more efficient in the cost of doing business and invest in markets and products that we know very well. The early results are very encouraging, overhead cost and solar spending are down substantially. Investment in core SSG (ph) display product is up. We’re gaining share in most of those markets and the other the indicators like evaluation tools and our product pipeline are up. These cost savings and harvested R&D investments will drive sustainable growth and profitability for Applied Materials. The money we’re reinvesting is going into our highest value opportunities, markets we know and business was very good incremental margins and high and/or growing the share. Now I’ll cover our third quarter results and comment on changes from the prior quarter. Orders were approximately $2 billion down 12% sequentially on lower semiconductor equipment demand partially offset by strength in display and AGS. We generated net sales of approximately $2 billion which was about as we expected. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.18 which was at the mid-point of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.9% down slightly due to a less favorable product mix within SSG partially offset by less inventory charges and lower variable compensation. Over the next two quarters we expect gross margins to decline slightly as products which traditionally have had lower share and therefore less scale become a larger percentage of SSG revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $535 million below the low end of our guidance primarily due to reduced corporate spending. Our effective tax rate was 23.9% on a non-GAAP basis. We now expect the non-GAAP four year rate to be between 24% and 25%. Cash from operations was $364 million or 18% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We returned $170 million to our stockholders in Q3; we used $50 million to repurchase 3.3 million shares and paid out $120 million in dividends reflecting the 11% quarterly dividend increase we announced in March. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of just over $3 billion. Next I will comment on our Q3 segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were down 22% to $1.2 billion due to lower but comparatively strong foundry spending. This reduction was partially offset by an increase in NAND, DRAM and logic orders. SSG net sales declined 1% to $1.3 billion with increases in NAND and logic offsetting most of the seasonal decline in foundry. SSGs non-GAAP operating margin decreased to 22.2% reflecting a less favorable product mix relative to Q2 and slightly higher operating expenses. In AGS orders were up 7% to $517 million due to improvements in customer utilization rates and wafer starts, AGS net sales were down 4% to $497 million due to a slightly less favorable wafer start by device type than expected. Non-GAAP operating margin was essentially flat at 23.3% despite slightly low revenue. Our display orders increased 31% to $256 million with record orders in array PVD. The increase was driven by TV fab investments in China and reflects our share gains with those customers. Display net sales increased 27% to $161 million consistent with the order ramp we experienced over the past few quarters. Display’s non-GAAP operating margin increased 4.6 percentage points to 21.1% which is our highest operating margin at this level of revenue since the first quarter of fiscal 2008. EES orders were $19 million and net sales were $45 million, up $7 million from Q2. The non-GAAP operating loss declined $15 million due to lower inventory charges and our cost reduction efforts. Non-GAAP operating expenses were below $30 million in Q3 and we remain on track to lower OpEx to the low $25 million exiting the fiscal year. Now, I will provide our fourth quarter business outlook. Overall, we expect the company’s net sales to be flat relative to third quarter with a little more risk than opportunity. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $525 million plus or minus $10 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.20. Within this outlook, we expect net sales from our semiconductor business to be flat to down slightly. AGS net sales are expected to be flat to up slightly. Display net sales should be down slightly with EES net sales up slightly. Now, let me turn over the call to Mike Sullivan for questions. 
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Bob. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Dustin, let’s please begin. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. Congratulations to both Gary and Mike. Great job to both of you guys. 
Mike Splinter: Thank you. 
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Jim. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: I guess, first question just relative to kind of the nearer term environment, I guess and this isn’t specific to Applied, because we have had the same questions as an industry for the competitors as well. It seems like what we were hearing at SEMICON West doesn’t quite match what’s happening in the very near-term, was that just a function of us misinterpreting the comments of SEMICON West to be near-term or have there been some pushes since those meetings relative to what we are looking at in terms of the third and fourth quarter today? 
Mike Splinter: Maybe I can comment from the industry standpoint, I think the foundry spending profile was quite predictable and pretty much in third calendar quarter is following what happened very similarly over the last three quarters. I think there is a fair difference as we look into our Q1 or into the fourth calendar quarter, we think foundry spending will pick up as they start driving towards their 20-nanometer nodes and/or it might be teen nodes for some suppliers and we’ll have a littler broader investment by a broader number of customers. I think if there is any modest surprise, it’s around a little higher memory investment in the second half of the year, Jim, but I think the foundry spending was pretty predictable. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: And then I guess this is follow-up how long visibility do you have into the memory piece. So, theoretically, memory spending is picking up over the next several quarters, I mean how much confidence do we have that, that’s a or one or two quarter phenomenon versus the two or three or four quarter phenomenon in terms of better spending there to go along with the seasonal recovery in the foundries? 
Mike Splinter: Yes, I think the hedge is what’s going to happen with the PC market exiting the year and going into 2014. If it was just the mobility market, we can see the compounded annual growth rate of bps per box, that’s been pretty aggressive, but it’s tempered by what’s been happening in PCs. So, if I knew what was happening in PCs, I’d be more confident that we’d say that you could think of a four – especially in DRAM a four quarter run, but I’d be quite hesitant to say that today. Flash memory, I think is a different story. There is technology investments here that need to be made. And I think we are seeing them being made both in 3D NAND as well as in plainer NAND. 
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Terrific. Thanks very much. 
Mike Splinter: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. And Krish, your line is open. 
Michael Sullivan: Okay, Dustin. Maybe we will move to the next questioner and hope that Krish can pull us again. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen & Company.
Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Company: So couple of things first of all Mike you talked about things snapping back in fiscal Q1, January quarter can you give a sense of how much you think revenue will snap back in January are we talking a few $100 million? 
Mike Splinter: Well I don’t think we’re ready to forecast our Q1 Time there is a lot of moving part so but I would say that we’re quite certain foundry spending coming back to previous levels. 
Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Company: And then maybe a question for Bob, Bob if I look at SSG gross margins they are down about 300 basis points on flat revenue also at it sounds like SSG margins are going to hold back overall margins a bit even as revenue grows here into January. If you look back maybe 5, 6, 7 years ago you guys are having definitely a lot more success now gaining share in this two big markets that you’re focused on an SSG but back you know years and years ago there was some effort to sort of see the market by I don’t want to say giving away tools but pricing tools are very low and so is there any sort of metric that you can give us to sort of hold our hand that you’re not doing the same thing time and that infact margins will come back in SSG as we get into next year. Thanks. 
Bob Halliday: Yeah there is a lot of moving parts Tim, in terms of I think the single biggest thing that has having impact in the next couple of quarters is mix, we’re actually gaining share and some in one or two segments one particular we haven't gained share a long time, I think we will gain share but without the scale our margins are lower. I think in the strong businesses the margins are holding up pretty well, so I think it's mostly a mix, we got a little bit of issues too out there with mix of customer type and I can’t point any explicit impact we can probably in the background in terms of how aggressively customers negotiated. So overall I would say we’re probably going to still in the ballpark but a bunch of mix issues right now we’re sorting through. 
Mike Splinter: On the areas where we’re growing share and it's actually one of our highest margin businesses, as I talked about earlier we definitely have momentum there very strong pull from customers in all markets for current and future technology. Again one of the major cases I have ever seen in my career of customer pull for products. We have a lot of momentum and foundry and logic, we’re increasing layer penetration at 28 nanometer, 20 nanometer and also since that with the technology leader on that particular device. We have really strong pull from customers on the unique imaging and defect capture capabilities, especially for patterning applications. We're ramping investment R&D in the field and as I said a lot of momentum there. The other thing I would say about the inspection business is we have the best e-beam technology in the world, very strong in terms of e-beam review and we can leverage this technology for growth in new markets. But overall inspection is one of our highest margins one of our most profitable businesses. In etch, the good news is that we're making tremendous progress and share this year, we’re penetrating new applications and foundry planar NAND and we’re extremely well-positioned and the first customer that's ramping 3D NAND. So, we are making very significant penetration, strong growth in the business. The margin’s there aren’t as good, they are not really different from where they were so there is no change in terms of the pricing behavior there it's just as we’re ramping especially with new customer where we haven't been for a long time those initial margins are not great. The other thing I would say in etch is that we’re working with technology leading companies, all of the technology leading companies on very differentiated products that have potential for significant share growth for us in the future. So certainly we're penetrating today as I said in foundries and planar and 3D NAND but we also have very, very strong technology around some of the key future inflections in the etch business.
Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Company:  Great, thank you. That was very, very helpful. Thanks Gary. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. 
Stephen Chin - UBS: Thanks. I also want to share my congrats to both Gary and Mike. 
Mike Splinter: Thank you. 
Gary Dickerson: Thanks Stephen. 
Stephen Chin - UBS: Just a follow-up question on planning for 2014 wafer fab equipment spending to be up 10% to 20%, I was just wondering if you could share kind of your latest color on how you think that may trend across memory, foundry, and logic, is it kind of memory and foundry or up, but maybe logic not up as much next year? 
Mike Splinter: Yes, certainly. Maybe I can just kind of run it down briefly for you, Stephen. I think if we would say that wafer fab equipment spending is up 10% to 20%, we think logic spending is probably going to be down as a percentage of the total. DRAM will probably be flat as a percentage of the total NAND and foundry up a bit as ahead of that 10% to 20%. And I think you can kind of relate that what’s happening in the end market as well and with the technology inflections in 3D NAND and then the continued build out in the mobility area in the foundry space. 
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay, thanks Mike. And then maybe a follow-up question, I think Bob called out that the number of evaluation tools are about 20% higher, maybe you can talk about where those evaluation tools are out is a mostly action inspection tools, is that what’s given you some of the confidence that you can clearly gain share in those two new areas? Thanks. 
Gary Dickerson: Well, certainly in the etch market as I talked about earlier, we have some very, very strong technology around some major inflections. And we are penetrating logic, foundry, and memory customers with that new technology, so that certainly is one of our major areas of focus. We also in other areas like CVD, we are bringing to market new technology targeted at inflections, and we also have very strong pull from technology leading customers for these products. And so we believe and CVD will build momentum for share gains in 2014 and 2015 with some of these products and new applications. So, that’s another area, but I would also say that as I mentioned we are increasing 300-millimeter R&D by $170 million run rate well along with some on the field support. And that really is translating into a great technology pipeline. So, it’s certainly not just etch and CVD there are other areas where we have disruptive technology, but those are two of the prime areas. 
Stephen Chin - UBS: Thanks, Gary. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse: Yes, good afternoon guys. Let me add my congratulations to both Mike and Gary. So, my first question guys, I kind of going to go back to one of the presentations at the Analyst Day over a month ago, will you talk about WFE spending being kind of $37 billion, I believe out in ‘16. I think I understand the positive impact of capital intensity on that number. I am wondering if you can help me understand how you guys think about spurring to the silicon growth and/or the profitability of the customers over time relative to that number. And I guess what I am really trying to get out is we have seen this pretty significant mix shift down in the consumer market from the high end to the mid-range to the low-end, which probably doesn’t reverse itself. I am kind of curious as how that dynamic need attraction in longer term forecast on capital spending? 
Mike Splinter: Thanks, John. That was a long question, but and a little further out question, I think how we tried to describe it at Analyst Day was really looking at process complexity increasing over these next few nodes to create the – we talked about the number of increased steps in 3D NAND, and those that would favor us, we also talked about the increased steps for vertical transistors, thin fabs, everybody is racing in that direction. And how much more difficult it is to be going to be to create these 10-nanometer or 7-nanometer patterns that our customers are going to be driving towards at that time. That’s by far the biggest effect. And then the second part of it is really a continued build out of the smartphone and mobility mobile tablets over that period of time. We expect that growth rate is going to continue that way until essentially all phones are smartphones. And I think we explained that in the event that there is just a significant amount more silicon that's been employed in one of those smartphones. And those are by far the biggest effects that kind of get us up to $37 billion wafer fab equipment spending range from where we’re today. Also I think you know there has been pretty significant under investment in DRAM over the last few years. We certainly don't think DRAM is going away as a category. And as the mobile build out happens it's going to return to a little bit larger bit growth than we've seen in the last few years. 
John Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities: At Analyst Day, you also talked about some development tools of record of 3D NAND and some in the last couple of weeks. Give us a little more insight into the 3D NAND performance metric that at the (inaudible) this week, I am kind of curious as if the (inaudible) have turned into product tools of record yet if they have how are you fairing and if they haven't when do you expect that to occur? 
Mike Splinter: Yeah we're very, very positive on our opportunity as the first customer ramps from planar to 3D NAND. We're seeing significant increase in market share especially in etch but our overall time and market share is definitely going up in that planar to 3D NAND transition. So I would say that the overall increase that we talked about around 25% in terms of the application or the total available market is about what we expected to be honest we’re doing even better in etch in that transition than we had anticipated. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. 
Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Just real quickly I had a follow-up on the foundry orders the 20 nanometer foundry orders in particular. I’m just wondering given the conviction that 20 nanometer foundry spending should rebound, are you seeing orders beyond the first large customer yet? 
Mike Splinter: On 20 nanometer orders, we're certainly seeing orders from more than one customer at this time. And maybe I can help you, our view is that by the end of '13 there'll be about 30,000 wafer starts capacity in the 20 nanometer range and we expect that growth rate upto over a 100,000 in 2014. So, I think we'll see acceleration as we approach the end of the year and then into 2014. 
Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: And are you viewing 20 nanometers the same thing as the 16-14 nanometer the synthetic extension? 
Mike Splinter: Yeah. This is always a confusing thing is that everybody seems to be naming their own dimension. So we're kind of lumping all that kind of 20 to 16, 14 into one bucket so that we can obviously hide the specific name of the customer. It's going to be a big category and a big over the next few years the biggest part of the growth in wafers and in spending. 
Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: This sounds a little tricky, but do you think given that would include the feel that extension would, do you think demand would be strong in the back half of 2014 than in the first half? 
Mike Splinter: I think it is probably bit too early for us to judge that right now I think right now our estimate really is that foundry spending will be up a little bit ahead of the overall 10% to 20% that we're thinking? 
Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay and then just finally one thing that caught my attention was on the e-beam comment that you could leverage growth for that technology in new markets and I'm wondering if you could give us an idea of what new markets are you talking about moving into inspection or maybe even into (inaudible)? 
Mike Splinter: Yes again I really believe that we have the best e-beam technology, we haven’t really capitalized on that as much as we could, but we have just introduced a new product and e-beam review. That’s getting very strong poll and acceptance by customers. And definitely, I think we can leverage that into litho and we also can leverage that into e-beam inspection. 
Wes Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: Alright, very helpful. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. 
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: Yes, thanks for taking my question. The first part of the question is for Mike, net interest income in about 20-nanometer and below, the size of the market could be about 100K, I am trying to better understand the thought process behind it, and let me get your view on the assumptions behind it, outside of Korea, I am sorry outside of Taiwan, Koreans are going to have rich production starting in December. And then at some point in ‘14 they are going to have puddle line, the same thing with global foundry. So, if the risk production for ‘14 is not going to happen until December, what gives you the confidence that 20 and below which going to have ‘14 in it could be as big as 100K unless you are making assumptions that 20 will dominate the 100K and I have a follow-up? 
Mike Splinter: Well, I think we have confidence that we get over 100K by the end of 2014, because the device makers need a refresh on technology. So, there will be a strong push to get that capability from the foundry suppliers. And whether we call it 20 or as I said 2016, ‘14 it will – the suppliers will – the foundry suppliers will meet demand, and we think there is a need for more than 100,000 wafers. And what we can see already from how the customers are lining up to buy product, it looks quite real to us. 
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: So, are you implying that the device-makers would, for the first time, would go from risk production to volume production in less than two quarters? 
Mike Splinter: Well, I think they have more than two quarters to do that actually. 
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: So, that means ‘14 especially for foundry could be pretty much back end loaded? 
Mike Splinter: I think ‘14 probably would be back end loaded, I agree, but certainly, 2016 is the major focus for most of our customers and most of them are planning pretty aggressive buys in 2014 for those nodes. 
Mehdi Hosseini - SIG: And Gary for you, you highlighted your confidence in gaining market share in etch, what’s the confidence there that gross margin there is not going to be sacrificed like what we are seeing in the process diagnostic? 
Gary Dickerson: Well, number one I wouldn’t say the gross margin is being sacrificed in the process diagnostic space. That’s actually one of our highest gross margin businesses in the whole company, very good gross margins, very profitable. And if I look out over the next few quarters that business is extremely profitable. In terms of the etch business, we have confidence in share based on what’s happening with customers. We have strong poll in foundries for new applications and extremely strong poll in NAND technologies both for planer and especially as I said earlier for a 3D NAND. So, that is very strong. We know what the pricing is there. Again it is that one is at the lower end in terms of our gross margins today, but there is a lot of leverage as we grow that business. Also as I said, we have very strong technology around future inflections. We are working with all of the leading semiconductor companies in areas that have potential for extremely high growth. So, that’s why we are optimistic on that business. Mike, you could also maybe give some color you have been in this for a while and maybe give a perspective on where we are today versus where we have been over the last 10 years. 
Mike Splinter: Well, I think on the opportunities for share gain Gary, I don’t think we have ever had greater opportunity and how well we are positioned towards the real key inflections when you look across what needs to be done just in logic, we have to get to help our customers get to fit in production over the next 12 months. And I think we’ve significant products there. We have to help reduce or improve the performance of interconnect and I think we’ve great products there. Transistors are now being defined with metal gates. We see a big shift there as we move from gate first to gate last across the industry and then in 3D NAND, we got 3D NAND in time with really I think game-changing application. So as I said I don’t think we have ever been in better position here. 
Todd Sloan: I will say again on etch that is one of lower gross margin product today. As we're growing that business with new customers, that's going to be a drag on our overall margins but the incremental profitability there is very, very good and we have tremendous traction around some of these major inflections and a very strong technology pipeline, good team. So, we have a lot of confidence that we're going to build this business into a strong contributor to profitable growth. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Terence Whalen with Citi. 
Terence Whalen - Citi: This question is question is on 3D NAND. Gary I think you said that the engagements with the customers are shifting fundamentally, occurring earlier and also developing more depth around the technology inflections. My question is, does this translate to better visibility or not in terms of actual slots? And also in terms of 3D NAND specifically, why would you have two customers up and running in terms of revenue? Thanks. 
Gary Dickerson: So in terms of visibility, one particular customer is leading the pack relative to the transition from planar to 3D NAND. They are very positive on the reliability and cost and moving forward very quickly. Visibility there relative to moving from development tool of record positions to production tool of record positions is very clear, that's happening. And as I said we’re very positive on what's happening in that transition and maybe even it's little better than what we had expected. Relative to the other customers, the timing for the transition from planar to 3D NAND is little a behind the first customer I don't know that we want to comment right now on exactly when that transition would happen but definitely behind the first customer, we’re working with those other customers on the technology development and we're also very optimistic in our opportunities as those customers make that transition. 
Terence Whalen - Citi: My other question is related to the China regional breakdown information you've shown for both revenue and orders. We saw a pretty significant increase in revenue sequentially in the July quarter and also a decent increase in orders. My question is, what is that reflective of? Is it reflective of display or is it actually reflective of some orders and shipments into China perhaps for an international customer thanks and 3D NAND. Thanks. 
Gary Dickerson: I think that was the China display orders. We got some big TV business in China. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. 
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: I wanted to just understand better understand your thoughts on restructuring given in the ES business your targets for the next year. Do you have any plan of change in your thought process given the progress you've made so far? 
Mike Splinter: Well we've made significant cuts in OpEx there in the last year. I think it's on the order of about a $120 million in the run rate OpEx cuts and in the solar business. The web business is actually doing very well. We don't talk about that very much, but that business is exceeding our expectations and pretty profitable. Relative to the solar businesses or any businesses within the company, we're not married to any particular business. We’ve operating profit goals that we have for businesses, businesses that meet those goals. We're going to invest and grow businesses that don’t meet that threshold. We will not continue in those businesses over the long-term. 
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank: Great, thank you. And then you had talked about $800 million of orders for your display business, can you share and then you also mentioned today that you see a path to above $1 billion of revenue and record margins in that segment. So, can you share your thoughts on how we should think about display spending in 2014 and also whether you can see double-digit growth in that segment in 2014? Thank you. 
Mike Splinter: I think we are very encouraged by the level of orders right now in this phase of the cycle. They are really showing our share gains in PVD, in particular. As you know, we have always been strong in CVD, but right now we see that TV investments going to continue. We have been pleasantly surprised by the growth in the size of TVs, but at Gen 8.5, this kind of 55 to 60 plus inch TVs are very, very cost effective now. We think in the marketplace we are going to see the prices come down and continue to see this very fast expansion in size of TVs. And then if you look in our display business, we have the foundation on the mobile business that corresponds to the rest of our mobility products. So, that really creates the floor on revenue in our display business. So, I think with the growth in PVD share, we are going to see significant performance next year. And I think Bob loves this business, because he just thinks that we are going to be able to get great leverage on the bottom line here as we amortize that infrastructure. 
Bob Halliday: Yes, I think this is good business model. I mean, these folks manage really tightly in downturns and really optimize the business in the upturn. So, I like the business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. 
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Thanks for taking my question. A follow-up question on display, if I look at your booking year-to-date has been pretty up – it’s a lot higher than your revenue year-to-date, why you are guiding down for the October quarter? 
Mike Splinter: Just lead time issue Edwin. I think you are going to see continued strong orders over the next few quarters. But as you know, this business is quite lumpy with long lead times. We are working those down, but it’s still from the time our customers ordered till the time they startup their factories. So, oftentimes over a year or so, it’s all about lead time versus the orders. 
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: I see. Okay, great. And then a question for you Bob, if I look at your OpEx guidance for the coming quarter and I contrast that against what your longer term target right it seems like your OpEx guidance is really at the long-term OpEx target of $2.1 billion, right. I guess to my question or one is, is that any kind of one-time statement you are realizing this quarter or are we done with OpEx, and I guess the other point I want to figure out is how much more do you think you can spend in R&D as a percentage of total OpEx? 
Bob Halliday: Yes, I think we have made pretty good progress. There is three buckets I guess of OpEx is the cost of doing business that which is all the support functions and is the R&D investment which is what you choose to invest in. And we have a lot of good investment opportunities right now Gary talked about. The third which is the field a lot of that is pushing some of our growth with the technical marketing guys in the field, so, I think in the R&D and the technical marketing guys as investments and the rest is the cost of doing business. And the cost of doing business, I can sort of see over the next two years sustainably keep improving our performance in the area, and I can sort of see the roadmap. So, I think on the R&D investments, those are choices we select. And I think if you think of that, those kind of investments, it’s like a pipe. What you are seeing in the short-term right now is we are really optimizing the investments that were halfway down that pipeline of products. What we have done now is we have increased the diameter of the pipe by funding, but we have also increased the velocity going through the pipe. So, in terms of spending, I think the cost of doing business will keep improving that over the next two years. I think the velocity of stuff out of the pipeline in terms of R&D, I am pretty excited about once those things start to hit. And right now, we are optimizing things, we’re half way down the pipe whether it's inspection or etch but we have some very some aggressive plans right now for stuff coming out of the pipe, so when those come out of pipe which will be over the next year to two, what you'll see is the red (ph) line will start to grow the OpEx spending as a percentage that goes. So right now we're spending on R&D a little bit higher than our revenue line, we’re funding with the G&A stuff but as we get that pipe really flowing the R&D will probably stay more constant and G&A will get optimized and revenues the margins will go up. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray. 
Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray: Two questions, how should we be thinking about 3D NAND orders sustainability in calendar '14 given that capital intensity is very high and the customers besides one customer are looking at second half '15 or into 2016. How should we think about this as one customer tries to debug the ire challenges as well as the retention challenges some things like that? And I have a follow up. 
Mike Splinter: Yeah. I don't want to talk for any specific customer relative to what their plans are. What I would say is that, what we’re hearing is that, they are pretty positive in terms of the progress they've made on that particular device and I think it's pretty well known that first stage is ramping and certainly if that is successful, they are going to continue to be fairly aggressive. 
Jagadish Iyer - Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then for as a follow up then. Mike, given your commentary that 2014 WFE spend is going to be up 10% to 20% and Gary's commentary about the increasing SAM opportunities, how should be think about silicon system orders overall for calendar '14 in terms of looking at vis-a-vis calendar '13 and how should be looking at it's overall profitability? Thank you. 
Mike Splinter: Well, maybe I should let Bob answer this question but I would just say that with our share gains and with the mix of spending at least the way we think of it now with foundry growing a bit faster than the main and our NAND flash growing faster than the main these are two good things for Applied Materials. So we’re not trying to forecast our full 2014 right now but I think the growth and the mix and the share gain are all heading in our direction. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: First, in terms of the process control opportunities you see ahead, you've talked a lot about the share gain opportunities. How do you see that TAM (ph) particularly on the foundry and logic side increasing as you go from 20 nanometers to the 16 and 14 nanometer FinFET notes? 
Mike Splinter: Well. I think that the TAM more than likely will go up as you go to those different technology notes. I think the key thing for us the really key thing that moves the needle for us is our layer qualification. That's one of the things that we watch very, very closely. And what we talked about was a significant increase in the layers when you look at the 28, 20 and also we're working very closely with leaders in FinFET technology. So that layer qualification for us went up something like 30% this year and that we believe is very positive for us. It gives us very positive momentum from a market share perspective 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: And my follow up question maybe for Bob in terms of the operating model specifically with the AGS business. And I think that this is an opportunity you've mentioned in the past where you can improve the overall margins of that business segment. One, what kind of improvements have you made to-date and two what are some of the longer term I guess efforts or initiatives you want to put in place to get those margins higher in that segment? 
Gary Dickerson: Sure. I think the opportunity on AGS is a pretty good revenue opportunity which drops down a high percentage of that drops down. So if you look at that business we sell a lot of spare parts, our own tools. So I think we could probably hold better share in that business and that's a function of sourcing correct – optimizing programs with customers and internal alignment on how that you do that when you first design the tools and then also as the tools released. I look at that as a really good opportunity, because the drop from profit in that business is pretty good. It’s also a really good cash flow business frankly, because the operating expenses once you set up the infrastructure are pretty low incremental cost. I like that business a lot. I think we got to implement some of things, which we are working on right now, again, good coordination internally. And we just keep chopping away at it, hacking away at it, or building one maybe that’s the right word, because I think it’s more of a building revenue thing on this side. 
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Patrick. And then Dustin, I know we have run past hour, but would you please poll Krish Sankar and see if he might still be back on the line? 
Operator: And the question line is open. 
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Hi, can you hear me? 
Mike Splinter: Yes. 
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, sorry about the earlier technical issue and congrats again to Gary and Mike. Two quick questions. One, Mike, you mentioned about DRAM capacity adds next year, I know they are just like one, two, three DRAM customers out there. Do you expect one or more than one customer to add capacity? And I had a quick follow up to Bob. 
Mike Splinter: We would expect one or two to add and the third one to optimize their overall capacity. 
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. That’s very helpful. And then a quick one for Bob, Bob you spoke about the increase in eval tools next quarter. I just wanted to figure out are these one year evals and how will it affect the expenses over the next year or so given that you won’t be generating revenue from them, but still supporting them? 
Gary Dickerson: Yes. Most of it are approximately one year, still the somewhat of an incremental expense, but the leverage on these things is pretty high, because remember, when you put an eval tool into a fab, the customer mix just as big in economic commitment as we do. So, it is a really positive indicator that they are going to buy your tools in some volumes. So, we kind of like high leverage eval tools. The cost of these is not here, it’s sort of in the marketing budget we talked about in terms of investing and most of these are in that forecast. 
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. 
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Krish. 
Gary Dickerson: Thanks. 
Michael Sullivan: We would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A reply of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. In our second fiscal quarter, Applied Materials delivered earnings that exceeded the high-end of our outlook. We fulfilled request for accelerated delivery of orders from a number of our semiconductor and display customers, while carefully managing our spending. At this point in the year 2013 is shaking up largely as we have expected. Demand for semiconductor equipment is healthy, utilization at our customers’ factories is steadily increasing, and investment in display is strengthening. Across the company, we are building momentum for profitable growth. Over the past two quarters, we have implemented measures to reduce our overhead costs and have redeployed spending to product development and our customer facing technical teams. These changes are enabling us to strengthen customer collaborations and increased our product development philosophy. We are focusing our R&D investments on key programs that support our strategic priority to increase our share in wafer fab equipment, while making targeted investments in display and other opportunities that expand our total available market. We see further opportunities to reduce our operating expenses and organizational complexity to improve operating margins at current revenue levels and provide significant earnings leverage as volumes increase. I will discuss these opportunities later in the call. Major industry trends are expanding our served available market in place to our strengths in Precision Materials Engineering. We expect to grow our share of wafer fab equipment this year while winning key development tool at record positions that provide a foundation for additional share gains in 2014 and beyond. We are also building momentum in display. Customers are adding capacity and we are seeing stronger order growth. We are significantly increasing our share of the display PVD market, complementing our strong position in CVD. In semiconductor, the mobility trend remains the biggest factor influencing industry growth. The global appetite for always on, always connected mobile devices continues to strengthen. And now the value of silicon being consumed by smartphones and tablets has surpassed that being used by PCs. Around 200 million smartphones and 35 million tablets shipped in the first calendar quarter of 2013. That’s in line with expected annual growth rate of 35% for phones and 55% for tablets. Demand for the advanced application of baseband processors used in smartphones and tablets is fueling investment by foundries as they add capacity at 28 nanometers, begin 20 nanometer pilot production and accelerate the development of 3D transistors. Transistor performance is the key battleground for our foundry customers. In his latest earnings call, Morris Chang described how TSMC has differentiated offering in high-K metal gate delivers better performance for their customers’ products. Applied’s clear leadership in the transistor module enables us to help our customers solve their high value device performance challenges and we are earning share gains at the leading foundries. The mobility trend also represents a tremendous demand driver for NAND Flash memory. With bit growth in the 40% to 50% range and supply and demand relatively well-balanced today, we believe NAND manufacturers will increase their investment levels in the second half. As sales figures for the first quarter clearly indicate, the PC market is navigating some challenging times. And as a result, customers are reducing capital spending plans for logic. Consumption of mobile DRAM has surpassed PC DRAM for the first time. Manufacturers have been migrating capacity to mobile and with tightening supply, prices have been rising. To meet near-term demand, we are seeing some incremental investment, primarily focused on technology conversions. We believe DRAM trends bode well for increased investment levels in the medium-term. While there have been some shifts in customers’ investment plans towards mobility, we maintain our view that 2013 wafer fab equipment will be in the range of $27 billion to $30 billion, reaching the high-end of the range will require accelerated build-out of the 20-nanometer foundry node and a further uptick in memory investment. Turning to display, we see increasing demand from emerging markets, as well as 50 inch and larger models becoming a more significant portion of global TV sales. This is driving healthy area growth, which we anticipate to be in excess of 10% for the year. The potential for undersupply in the second half is stimulating capacity investments. We are receiving orders for new display factories in China, and expect this equipment to be installed in the fall. Demand for mobile devices and touchscreens remains robust and investment continues with focus on advanced technologies, including OLED. We’re strengthening market conditions in our shared gains, we are beginning to demonstrate the potential of our display business. In solar, equipment industry conditions remain challenging. We are significantly reducing our exposure to the current weakness in the market by substantially scaling back our investment. We expect our quarterly operating expenses for EES to be below $25 million exiting the fiscal year. Overall, as we look to the second half of 2013, we see spending spread across the broader base of semiconductor customers. Memory investments look incrementally more positive and demand in display is strengthening. More importantly at Applied, we are building momentum towards profitable growth. We are focused on strategy execution and winning those critical tool selections that support share gains while in parallel making changes to the organization that will allow us to deliver stronger operating margins and increase our investment in attractive growth opportunities. Before I hand the call over to Gary, I would like to officially welcome Bob Halliday to his first earnings call as Applied Materials’ CFO. Bob brings a strong track record of results and a wealth of industry experience in this role. He is already proving to be an outstanding leader for our global finance team. Now, let me hand the call over to Gary for additional comments about our growth initiatives. Gary?
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. As Mike outlined global adoption of mobile devices drives growth in the electronics industry. It is also increasing the speed of innovation within the value chain. Our semiconductor and display customers are striving to provide consumers with more capable mobile products and this is accelerating changes in device technology that are enabled by the Applied Materials’ core strength in precision materials engineering. All of this creates a great environment for us to execute our strategy and drive profitable growth. Today, we are building momentum by strengthening our team and focusing our investments to deliver growth in revenue and operating profit. We are building momentum by increasing share and entering into earlier and deeper collaborations with our largest customers. We are leveraging our strength to help customers make major transistor and memory transition that will happen in 2014 and 2015. And we are building profitable growth in additional segments that will provide significant improvement in our overall operating margins. In order to accelerate the execution of our strategic plans, we are strengthening our organization and business processes. We are aggressively managing our cost to drive improvement in operating margins and taking further steps to reduce overhead expenses. We are actively managing our product portfolio by focusing on our best opportunities and increasing funding for those programs that really moves the needle for our customers and for Applied. In addition, we continue to operate our product development engine to improve our ability to define winning products and increase the velocity of our development process.  Our customers are faced with increasingly complex device performance and the old challenges, as they transition to new device technology and new materials. This is driving significant pull from our largest foundry, logic and memory customers for earlier and deeper collaboration on our next generation products as they focus on accelerating technology development and technology transfer into high volume manufacturing. These broader and deeper collaboration span our current areas of precision materials engineering market leadership and additional market segments, where we have significant potential to grow share as future device technology is adapted. Applied’s position as the leader in enabling precision materials engineering technology is giving us insight into future device performance and yield problems that are critical for our customers. In our early engagements, we see an increase in atomic level customization of our precision films combined with enabling technologies, including precision materials modification, materials removal and interface engineering on Applied Materials platforms. This gives Applied a unique opportunity to solve some of our customers’ challenges with new solutions that leverage our strong materials engineering technology portfolio. Some emerging materials engineering examples include improving film stability and very high aspect ratio structures, film densification, material selectivity for deposition and etch and atomic level interface engineering to improve device performance and yield by preventing corrosion and metal oxide growth. To support broader and deeper customer relationship, we are strengthening our technical teams in the field by moving key people into higher impact position and bringing new talent into the company. In semiconductor, key market inflections are growing our available market while creating opportunities for Applied to demonstrate leadership and win share. as the foundries start their transitions to 20 nanometer technology, we see Applied serve the market opportunity growing approximately 25% relative to the 28 nanometer baseline. Our strongest positions are at the foundries. And as they focus our new transistor technology, this placed to our strength and provides a great platform for us to grow share with our leadership products. The architectural advantages offered by our epi, thermal, metal deposition, CMP and implant product, combined with our ability to integrate these processes are enabling customers to solve major device performance and yield challenges associated with the move from oxynitride transistor scheme to a high-K metal gate glass devices. In addition, we see increased urgency in the development of FinFET technology where the interplay between deposition, annealing and implant steps is even more important. When the FinFET inflection occurs, we expect our served markets to incrementally grow by 5% to 10% on top of the 25% increase during the 20 nanometer transition. Beyond our increasing opportunity in foundry and logic, we expect our served market to grow by about 25% on a wafer start basis as memory customers’ transition from plainer NAND to the first generation 3D device technology. We anticipate shipping production equipment for 3D NAND in the fourth quarter of 2013 for the initial ramp of these new devices, another market that has potential for profitable growth is CMP. We are seeing an increase in the number of CMP staff for leading edge device technology. We recently began shipments of new CMP technology that we anticipate will enable us to increase share starting this year and we’ve already secured new positions with large foundry customers. We are also building profitable growth in additional segments. Inspection represents a great opportunity for profitable growth, and we are focusing on segments of the market while we are strong and have differentiated technology. We are demonstrating solid momentum in wafer and inspection, and with recent wins at leading foundry and logic customers, we are very well positioned for share gains in 2013 and 2014. In etch our strategy is to increase share and applications in foundry and memory where we have valuable and sustainable differentiations. In the past quarter, we received production orders for memory customers and one new development tool record positions that gives us momentum to deliver a significant improvement in etch financial performance. In display, we have great momentum. We are increasing our market share and during the second quarter, we secured 100% of the CVD and PVD business for a new factory in China. As the market rebounds, we see the potential to book more than $800 million of orders this calendar year. The structural changes we have made to our display organization during the downturn provide us with strong operating leverage as volumes increase. As the industry moves to new transistor technology and OLED from mobile applications in TV is becoming more process and material technology intensive. This plays to Applied strength in Precision Materials Engineering for large area application. In TV 4K resolution and increasing average screen sizes create a number of engineering and manufacturing challenges. Larger areas and smaller pixels make some uniformity and particle performance increasingly important. Our CVD and PVD systems have clear architectural advantages in device performance and yield that enable us to deliver increased value to our customers. Applied has been the clear leader in CVD for many years. And now we are demonstrating excellent traction with our pivot PVD tool and expect to significantly grow our share in PVD in 2013 and beyond. In summary, our semiconductor and display customers are in arrays to deliver differentiated products to gain share and mobility. This is driving a big push by customers to accelerate time to market of new devices and new materials. These inflections create a great opportunity for Applied to leverage our leadership in Precision Materials Engineering and earlier and deeper engagements with customers to solve their major device performance and yield challenges and drive profitable growth. We are building momentum by strengthening the Applied team and focussing our investments to deliver growth and revenue and operating profit. We are very excited about the momentum we are building for profitable growth and we’ll discuss our plans and opportunities in more detail at the Analyst Meeting on July 8. Let me now hand the call over to Bob for further details on our performance. Bob?
Bob Halliday: Thanks, Gary. I look forward to working with everyone on the call again in my role as the CFO for Applied Materials. I’ve been a part of the Applied team for over a year now, and I’m extremely impressed by the depth of technology and talent we have across the company. I was immediately impressed with Applied’s ability to design and build great products. As a product company, there are three legs on the profitable growth stool. The first leg is the ability to design and build great products. Applied definitely has that ability. What also struck me was the economic power of these products. Applied’s integrated solutions combine superior hardware, chemistry, and process support. The economic value to customers can be great and the economic value of these strong products leveraged off of a common platform is also great for Applied Materials. The second leg of our strategy for profitable growth is the ability to solve customers’ high value problems. I have been increasingly impressed over the last year that our improved internal capability to learn and solve these problems. The increasing ability to understand customers’ high value problems combined with our ability to design incredible products results in a more products that hit the market requirements. As I said before, products that hit the market requirements result in very good businesses for Applied Materials. The third leg of our profitable growth strategy is our ability to fund growth and increase investor returns. We’ve already taken number of actions in recent quarters to redirect spending to fund new product development and strengthen our technical marketing capabilities. These actions include steep reductions in solar spending, our gain integration synergies, the global workforce actions we announced in October and a reprioritization of our R&D projects. We are reinvesting that savings in product development to drive our growth. Looking at our financials, R&D spending as a percentage of R&D plus G&A has increased from 53.3% in Q2 of last year to 57% in Q1 of 2013 and 58.5% in Q2 2013. The next question is can we fund growth and increase our profitability at all levels of sales? In my first couple of months as CFO, I’ve had the opportunity to examine each of our businesses in greater detail. And I see opportunities to lower our cost and improve our efficiency. I plan to review our detailed operating model in timeline with you at our Analyst Meeting in July. At this time, I will share some initial perspectives on seven areas of our business. First, in EES we have very aggressively reduced our losses. Our non-GAAP losses in Q2 decreased to $34 million and are down 40% from the same period last year, despite half of the revenue. We will continue to reduce our spending in losses. Second, in display, Q2 non-GAAP operating margins more than doubled from the prior year to 16.5% on slightly lower net sales, our display business has a very attractive business model and managed to stay profitable throughout the worst downturn in its history. We see significant leverage returning to this business in the up cycle. Third, in SSG, Q2 non-GAAP operating margins were in line with the prior year when normalized for revenue despite an overall increase in SSG R&D spending. In SSG products, where we have significant share, the operating margins are very good. With increasing customer pull and a higher hit rate on product development, we believe that some of our lower share products are on the verge of significant increases in operating leverage. For us in AGS, non-GAAP operating margins increased to 23.2%, up 3 percentage points relative to the same quarter last year. There is an opportunity to grow AGS revenue and profitability. Fifth, the efficiency of resources allocation can be improved between our businesses through a comprehensive product portfolio process. We should have low sticky assets in the company that we embarking on that process. Sixth, in operations the vast majority of our product cost is materials. we plan to work aggressively across the company to design for lower cost, and also save money on existing products. This will take some work, but it is another significant opportunity. Seventh, and finally, all of the functional organizations including operations, supply chain, finance, legal, human resources, IT and facilities need to be efficient and scaled appropriately for all of our business levels. Now I’ll cover our second quarter results and comment on changes from the prior quarter. Orders grew 7% led by strong demand for our semiconductor and display equipment. We generated net sales of approximately $2 billion, which was just above the high-end of our guidance, led by strength at Silicon Systems. all segments other than EES were at the high-end or exceeded our revenue expectations. Non-GAAP gross margins was 43.2%, up 3.4 points, driven primarily by the increase in revenue and lower inventory charges. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $567 million, in line with our guidance with G&A expenses down slightly relative to Q1. We plan to reduce the G&A and manufacturing overhead components of our spending more time, both in absolute dollar terms, and as a percentage of non-GAAP operating expenses. we will continue to update you on our progress. In Q3, we expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $550 million plus or minus $10 million, which includes a shutdown in the first week of July. Our effective tax rate was 24.9% on a non-GAAP basis. We still expect the full-year rate to be between 24% and 26%. Cash flow operations was $224 million or 11% of revenue, reflecting severance payments relating to our previously announced workforce reductions and higher working capital requirements associated with the increase in revenue levels. We used $100 million to repurchase 7.5 million shares and returned $108 million in dividends. The first payout at our recently increased dividend level will occur in the third quarter. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest in attractive opportunities in our core businesses, increase the dividend in line with the growth of the business, and utilize share repurchases to manage dilution and return excess cash to shareholders. Cash in investments ended the quarter at $2.85 billion, up slightly from Q1. Next, I will comment on our Q2 segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were up 14% to $1.55 billion primarily driven by increases in NAND and DRAM. Foundry again represented the majority of our orders and remained highly concentrated. SSG net sales increased 33% to $1.3 billion at the high end of our outlook of up to 20% to 35% driven by foundry and stronger DRAM spending. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 25.5% driven by the higher revenue. In AGS, orders were down 12% to $481 million due to the seasonal effect of service contract renewals and a slightly lower than anticipated improvement in customer utilization rates in wafer starts. AGS net sales were up 10% to $517 million at the high end of our outlook. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 23.2% due to higher revenue and our cost management initiatives. Our display orders increased 41% to $195 million, reflecting the investment in new TV fabs in China along with share gains in multiple product lines. We expect orders to continue to increase in Q3. Display net sales increased 46% to $127 million above our outlook of flat to up 25%. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 16.5%.  EES orders were $39 million and net sales were $38 million. EES posted a non-GAAP operating loss of $34 million and we wrote off the remaining goodwill for the solar business in the quarter. We are lowering our spending in EES and the non-GAAP OpEx run rate is below $30 million per quarter exiting Q2. As mike mentioned, we expect to reduce EES quarterly spending to below $25 million exiting the fiscal year. Now I will provide our third quarter business outlook. Overall, we expect the company’s net sales to be up slightly from the second quarter and non-GAAP earnings per share should be in the range of $0.16 to $0.20.  Here is my conclusion. We have very good product development people and IP. If we can get a high hit rate on understanding customers’ high value problems and new fabs internally, we can significantly increase profitability. Mike, Gary, and I see a clear path to profitable growth and we look forward to sharing more of that with you in July. Now, let me turn over the call to Mike Sullivan for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Bob. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one follow-up. Kia, let’s begin.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The first question will come from Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence Whalen – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, the EES OpEx run rate is targeted to be about $25 million year end. Any sense for where that was this quarter. Thank you.
Bob Halliday: Yeah, we exited the quarter as I mentioned, at $30 million and it might have been touch over that - the quarter, but we exited 31 going down for the rest of the year.
Terence Whalen – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: And then my follow-up question is on the gross margin side, you said that part of the positive variance in gross margin was due to fewer inventory reserves, can you help us understand going forward whether you see that trend continuing or any insight on gross margin going forward would be helpful? Thank you.
Bob Halliday: Gross margins are pretty good this quarter. The year-on-year comparison was aided by couple of things. We had some inventory reserves last year and then this year we had a good drop, so we had incremental revenues, which dropped through the gross margin line. If you look at our overall sales and expense and profitability guidance for next quarter, it implies reasonably positive gross margin opportunities next quarter also.
Operator: The next question will come from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So first just in terms of guidance, can you help us directionally how you think about the four segments that you guys have?
Bob Halliday: I will give it a shot, Edwin. Most are up a little bit, I think our sales will be up somewhat and I think it’s pretty much across the board.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, that’s helpful. How about your booking trends, this quarter your booking was quite a bit about your revenue, but next quarter you’re just guiding to a modest increase in revenue. Does that mean that there is some comp softness in booking or how do you think about that and what are the moving parts between the foundry, logic et cetera?
Gary E. Dickerson: Edwin, as you know, we don't give the bookings guidance. We continue with the overall CapEx guidance of flat to down 10% as Mike talked about earlier. We're incrementally more optimistic, it’s part of what happens in CapEx, it depends on just a few customers in foundry and memory spending later in the year. So, overall, the key message I think for us is around the transition in transistor technology as Mike talked about earlier. That's the key battleground in mobility and that opportunity in the transistor inflection starting in 2014, also 3D memory, those are extremely positive opportunities for us to grow overall share.
Operator: The next question will come from Tim Arcuri with Cowen & Company.
Tim M. Arcuri – Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, a couple of things; first, Bob, just based on the answer you just gave can we assume that revenue in SSG will be up, I know you don't want to talk about bookings, but revenue will be up, is that right?
Bob Halliday: Yeah, let me give you a little more color than I gave to Edwin. If you look at where the increase is, the increase is more concentrated in SSG and display and less sold in solar and AGS. So of our fix, SSG should do relatively well of the four.
Tim M. Arcuri – Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Okay, thanks. And R&D was up to a record high, I was going back to my model and I couldn't find anything this high. I know that you talked about 450 being less than a $100 million in fiscal 2012, but you haven’t talked about what 450 will be this year. Is the increase due to 450 and maybe you can give us some sense of what the spending will be on 450 during this entire fiscal year? Thanks.
Gary E. Dickerson: Just as we said last quarter, really no net increase in 450 spending in our current plan. The key focus for us are around these technology transitions in the transistor and 3D memory. Those are big opportunities for us. As Mike talked about, the increase for us is about 25% in the gate-last technology, another 5% to 10% in FinFET technology, about 25% opportunity increase for us in the first generation of NAND Flash technology. So those are the areas where we’re really focused on in terms of our R&D investments.
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, Tim, I’d add to that, we’re seeing really good customer pull right now for the new products that we have in a number of areas. But even in inspection and Etch, which have traditionally been weak for us, customers are really pulling on us to offer new and better solutions as we go through the transistor change to 3D. We have some really good capability there that I think is quite differentiated.
Gary E. Dickerson: We’re also increasing our investment in application support in the field. In our PDC business, we have the second highest bookings quarter, orders quarter in the history of PDC, and the highest ever orders quarter for our Brightfield business. So we’re making investments in R&D, but we’re also making investments in the field and application support and also focused on earlier and deeper collaborations with customers as they go through these device transitions.
Tim M. Arcuri – Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, gentlemen.
Operator:  The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thomas Yeh – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. This is Thomas Yeh calling in for Krish Sankar. Thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe some more color on the overall order sustainability heading into the second half, qualitatively; you noted order strength driven partially by memory. I was wondering if you saw any pullings related to that and wanted to get your perspective on the first half versus second half and what that might imply for the run rate heading towards the second half?
Michael R. Splinter:  Hey, Thomas, may be I can start with the market and then let Bob or Gary talk a little bit more specifically about order sustainability. What we are viewing on WFE for the year is that second half will be stronger. We think about 55% 45% range there. If you think about that relative to last year, we said this year that WFE will be flat to down 10%. And year-over-year when you are thinking about that, most of the down is in foundry because of the supply chain changes there. So I think the thing is that foundry is still a major, major part of the overall make up. But in the second half, we are seeing some increase spending from, in particular, memory, primarily from NAND Flash. But we’re also seeing a little bit of pick up in DRAM as there are some supply constrains there with, in particular, mobile DRAM.
Thomas Yeh – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. And Gary, you mentioned expectations for the total served available market increasing by 25% with the transition to 20 nanometers. Can you highlight which particular product segments within SSG that could provide the most areas of opportunity for you?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, the transistor, as we’ve talked about before, is really the sweet spot for Applied Materials that where we have the strongest positions that includes epi and annealing, the implant business, CDP is actually also an area that’s growing through new transistor technology. So those would be the areas that are going to grow the most and PVD is another one that’s going to grow as we go to next generation transistors.
Operator: The next question will come from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs & Company.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great guys, thanks so much for taking the question, I appreciate it. Mike and Gary and Bob, you guys referenced the fact that some of the logic spending is coming down commensurate with some of the weakness in the PC segment. Do you think we felt the brunt of the impact there already, I noticed some of the big logic customers are significantly underspending their stated budgets. Do you think that we’ve seen the worse of that in terms of order or shipment declines or do you think some of that could still impact the second half?
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, we believe that we have, but of course, we have to be able to see what the trend is like for back-to-school, sales in particular, certainly at this point, utilization is moving up. We expect spending in logic to move up modestly in the second half. And part of the reason we kept our overall WRP forecast flat was that, we saw some increase in foundry spending. We saw pretty much a commensurate decrease in logic spending. That’s our best estimate at the current time, Jim. So that’s kind of where we are.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs & Co.: That makes a lot of sense. And from my follow-up, you guys have mentioned customer pulls in a number of areas, you specifically talked about, Mike even in some of the areas where you traditionally haven’t had the strength. I’ve heard you guys comment over the last 9, 12 months that some of the greatest pull from customers is in the process diagnostics areas, that’s still kind of number one on the list of where you’re seeing the customer pulls?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yeah, Jim, as I mentioned, we had our second highest quarter’s quarter in the history of PDC last quarter and our highest ever in wafer infection.
Operator: The next question will come from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Thank you very much. Since you’ve been talking about the transistor technology, I have a question on your exposure if I divide the wafer fab equipment into front end of the line and the back end of the line, what’s the overall spending split and how is your exposure different, because you have higher transistor exposure?
Michael R. Splinter: I don’t know that. I think one of things that Gary has been alluding to is how fast certain areas are growing for us. And we think the complexity around the transistor is going to grow significantly to be able to make these advanced 3D. There is a huge race to get the FinFET and advance the transistors and logic, there’s a huge race to get the 3D devices and NAND Flash. And I think that’s where we see the big growth or the exposure is growing fast there, I think about 25% in each of those areas. So that’s really also in our sweet spot and our strength area and that’s where we’re also investing a lot of our new R&D dollars there to ensure that we can be there with the solutions our customers need.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then this – my follow-up is on the OpEx, you said in your next quarter’s OpEx guidance you include one quarter or one week of shutdown, so will the OpEx increase in Q3?
Michael R. Splinter: The overall OpEx guidance was $550 million, plus or minus $10 million, which is down from Q2’s $567 million. We get some benefit from the shutdown, but we’re also managing other expenses pretty tightly too.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Bob Halliday: Welcome.
Operator: The next question will come from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin – UBS Securities LLC: Yes, thanks. Maybe a follow-up question, Bob, on the last point about just trying to deliver higher operating margins and higher revenues, just listening to your seven observations, I mean, is it fair to assume this is mostly going to be done from say more efficient OpEx management and maybe less there from higher gross margin since there is going to be three big silicon customers?
Bob Halliday: I think it’s – I’ll do below the gross – I’ll do the gross margins lines a bit. I think we can efficiency and cost savings on both expense line and the cost of goods line. And I think the opportunity is kind of half and half to be honest with you. I think R&D efficiency is also going to drive the faster product development and to certain extent it will be self funding between efficiency. I think on the gross margin line above that, people sometimes ask me about the question, can you increase your peak operating profit versus say 2011, we did all fairly. So if you look at gross margins and you look at gross margin today we have a few things going in our favor. One, we have good mix between the segments where our future growth will be more incenting versus solar for instance in 2011. Secondly, we will, I think, will drive this cost reduction which I spoke of just a minute go. And thirdly, as we start to get some traction in some of these high value businesses, I think those have favorable pricing components. So actually the gross margins look okay, it’s a combination of mix between segments, some potential mix between products, cost of goods sold reductions and pricing, you commercially negotiate all that stuff.
Stephen Chin – UBS Securities LLC: Okay, thanks. But may be a question, Mike, for your early thoughts on 2014 with wafer fab equipment spending yield, even if we assume end market demand for electronics to stay normal with all these silicon technology transitions that you are talking about happen in your 3D since that 20 nanometer, can we assume you’re investing this year for another strong year in wafer fab equipment spend for next year too? Thanks.
Michael R. Splinter:  Thanks, Steven. I don’t think we really formulated a detailed view on 2014, but maybe just a couple of thoughts. Assuming that let’s say we can have another 30% plus year growth in smartphones and a 50% growth year in tablets, I think the foundry spending is flat to up and maybe up a little bit more than that because of complexity increases in the 20 and 16 nanometer and the push to advance transistors. And then I think we are going to see an investment cycle in NAND Flash, not quite, we don’t precisely have that pegged yet on exactly how the cycle will go, but I think it will certainly start in 2014. So in general, would be a positive view on 2014 and the downside is where is logic spending going to end up. But I would also say relative to where are we investing, we are absolutely focused on these technology transistors, the technology transitions. The transistor is a key battleground in mobility, 3D NAND is also a key battleground. So the opportunities for us are significant and that’s the focus of our R&D dollars.
Operator: The next question will come from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on your estimates or CapEx for the year. You mentioned that’s between $27 billion, I was wondering if you could give us – give some color on the mix between DRAM, NAND, and logic, and specifically, within NAND Flash, I was wondering what part of the spending are you seeing happen in the first half versus the second half?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure, thanks, Satya. So first of all, I think one of the big trends is in and around foundry, spending has been quite concentrated as Bob alluded to. And we think in the second half, foundry spending will be roughly flat, but spread out among a wider array of our customers. We think that’s the important factor is, you just started to think about what’s going to happen here in the second half of the year. We think logic spending comes up from reasonably low levels in the first half of the year. And then we’ll see growth in both DRAM and NAND spending, but we don’t think they exceed 25% of the overall wafer fab equipment spend, that’s putting them together, and I think some customers have fundable spending there. so we see positive trends in NAND and mobile DRAMs, so I think it moves up from sub 20 in the first half of the year on memory.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And Mike, I guess like on NAND, are you seeing much wafer capacity additions in the back half? Do you have an estimate for how much wafer capacity is, that you think is being in NAND Flash this year?
Michael R. Splinter: I don’t have a precise estimate, I think there’s still capacity expansion within existing fabs that’s everybody’s first move because 3D NAND isn’t ready yet and I don’t think we’ll see big expansions until we get to 3D NAND. And then as I said, we’ll see a build investment cycle in NAND, but I think most of that’s next year.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator:  The next question will come from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah – Deutsche Bank Securities: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Mike, I just wanted to better understand the mix between 28 and 20 nanometer bookings that you see in the foundry space between the first half and the second half?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, the first half is pretty much all 28 nanometer. So we see 20 nanometer starting to pick up in the second half of the year, and still pilot production in the second half of the year. So maybe if you add up across the industry, you get between 25,000 and 50,000 wafers. But I think the key thing is working with customers on those real technology and yield problems as these new technologies get into production, that’s really where our focus is with customers that’s what – why they are calling us and why we are excited about not only the rest of this year, but the subsequent years. It’s very difficult to actually to – customers don’t buy for one generation. So even though – initially go into 28 nanometer production, certainly they are looking forward to what are they going to do in 20 nanometer, 16 nanometer, and that’s actually helping us pull some of our inspection tools, CMP tools and other products into 28 nanometer orders.
Vishal Shah – Deutsch Bank Securities:
 :
Michael R. Splinter: First of all, I don’t think we’re seeing anybody slowing down on 20 nanometers or thinking that this is going to be a small note, quite the contrary, they want to get this next generation of shrink in the production quickly, get the yields up, put in the 3D- transistor as quickly as possible. This was a real race and Gary?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yeah, on PDC, the strongest order, Paul, that we are seeing right now is from foundry and logic customers.
Vishal Shah – Deutsch Bank Securities: Thanks, guys. 
Operator: The next question will come from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray
Jagadish Iyer – Piper Jaffray, Inc.:  Thanks for my question. Two questions, first, Gary, you talked the SAM growth on the front end, how much of it will be visible in 2013 and how should we kid of reconcile this with the share gains you alluded earlier in your prepared remarks in the silicon?
Gary E. Dickerson: I am sorry.
Jagadish Iyer – Piper Jaffray, Inc.: I just wanted to find out how should we reconcile this with share gains that Mike alluded in the prepared remarks as you talk about the SAM growth in the front end, how much of it will be visible this year and how should we think about it going forward and then I have a follow up. Please.
Gary E. Dickerson: So the two major transitions that we are focused on right are the 20 nanometer gate-last transition, that’s going to really be more in 2014, maybe at the end of 2013 and the other one is in 3D memory and certainly that’s more – also more of a 2014 story.
Jagadish Iyer – Piper Jaffray, Inc.: Fair enough. And then I think you guys mentioned about the strength in the display segment. Can you help us there whether there is broad-based ordering in the display segment? You did allude to a major Chinese LCD factory coming up, are you seeing any other factories over Gen 8.5 coming up in probably the second half of this year or potentially in the horizon? Thank you.
Michael R. Splinter:  Jagadish, you asked about factories larger than 8.5? Okay, anyway, I think we’re seeing very strong orders in display right now. We are projecting $800 million for the year, which is doubling over last year. And we are seeing most of the build out from multiple customers in China and no factories above 8.5 at this time. Although, we believe as the TVs get larger above 60 inches and they become a significant part of the overall mix that we will see customers move to Gen 10 and Gen 11.
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Jagadish.
Operator: The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini – Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. Mike, a question for you, you mentioned second half bigger than the first half, you mean shipment and revenue, it doesn’t really say much about booking because due in lack of visibility into spending in 2014, bookings could be down or flat into the second half, correct?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, I think that’s unlikely, but I think we are projecting, and when I look at our backlog, I think that’s unlikely. Our backlog has been growing. I think it will grow into the third quarter, but it’s not that far ahead of what we think shipments of revenue will be in the second half of the year especially if our 55-45 second half, first half mix comes out to be relatively accurate.
Mehdi Hosseini – Susquehanna International Group, LLP: So I’m confused, are you saying that both revenue and bookings will be up in the October quarter?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, I’m not making a projection for October quarter at this point. Just talking with what the information we have today, looking first half, second half, whether – we don’t see a scenario if spending is 55% of the total that bookings would be down in total in the second half. I mean, quarter-to-quarter, there can shifts.
Mehdi Hosseini – Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Okay. And one question for Gary, I’m going to ask you what I asked last quarter, you’re talking about the share gain and everything, but can you please explain to me in a simple way other than ASP, what is it that you were doing to enable you to gain market share in a oligopolistic environment? You only have one competitor in each segment, so what is it other than ASP that enables you to go and actually gain market share without giving out much margin?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yeah, the key thing for us is to focus on the key – high value problems for our customers. If you look at display for instance, this concept applies to all of our different businesses. We’re focused on the key device performance and yield challenges of our customers. So as they go to larger panel sizes and smaller pixels, the particle requirements are increasing from 10 to 100 times to get equivalent yield. So our focus there is on how do we have an architectural advantage that delivers better particles than our competitors. The same thing is true as you go to larger panel sizes. Customers if they had a – if we have a certain uniformity on our product, they can sell the panels into their own brand. If they have a worst uniformity, they go to an OEM brand at a much lower margin. So the leverage in yield and the leverage in device performance for our customer is significant and that is the strategy that we are pursuing that is growing share in the display business today. The same thing is true in the semiconductor business. As our customers move to new transistor technologies, as they move to new 3D memory technologies, these transitions as you go to FinFET or other devices are extremely difficult. They have big challenges in trying to drive time to market for these products and it is the key battleground for our customers in mobility. Our products that enable those transitions in the architectures that’s where we are focused, that’s why we are increasing our R&D spending, that’s why we are increasing the technical support of our customers in the field and that’s the formula at least for me and 30 years in this industry, that’s the same formula I’ve seen work in every one of these different businesses.
Mehdi Hosseini – Susquehanna International Group, LLP: So…
Gary E. Dickerson: Thank you, Mehdi.
Michael R. Splinter: We’ve got time for just two more questions please.
Operator: The next question will come from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks a lot. May be just following up on that comments you made about the drag towards 14 nanometers FinFET with the foundries. Customers have talked about accelerating that from 28 through 20 and possibly even skipping some of the 20 and going straight to 14-nanometer FinFET. I guess, how do you rationalize, I guess, what the customers are looking for there? And from what process segments do you see, I guess, an expansion at the 14-nanometer node, is it the same one as 20, or if you see areas like CVD also growing faster than the marketplace?
Bob Halliday: So the first transition that will make a tangible difference to our growth in share and revenue is really 28-nanometer gate last. And then customers will move to FinFET technologies at 16 and 14 nanometers where there’s still more incremental opportunities for us. The really big areas of focus for us are around the transistor as I talked about earlier with epi, anneal, implant, PVD, and there are more CMP steps as the customers move to FinFET technology. So those are the ones that with these transistor technology changes that there are the real big opportunities for us. I would say also, I talked a little bit about combining the precision films with precision materials removal, material modification, and interface engineering, and we’re certainly seeing more of those types of issues where combining these precision materials engineering technology could provide our customers with a real device performance and yield advantage and also be very positive for Applied Materials as we combine these technologies on our platforms.
Patrick J. Ho – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, that’s really helpful. Bob, a question for you on the materials cost reduction that you talked about on the call, is it more of the design phase that you’re going to be working on helping to reduce that front or is it the supply chain or is it a combination of both?
Bob Halliday: It will be both. We’re going to do both and some of the things we’re going to do to enable both is getting tighter alignment across the organization between operations, the business units, the guys who control the releasing of products to the suppliers. So there is a path to do this., I would say that, we’ll get incremental progress on both and it will be cumulative. The good thing about materials cost reduction as you start to build the momentum, it’s annuity payment, right. You get it every year on equipment, you get it on spare parts. So it’s an annuity payment that every year goes up, you had several points of cost reduction, it’s cumulative over time.
Patrick J. Ho – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Bob Halliday: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question will come from Ben Pang with B. Riley & Company.
Ben Pang – B. Riley & Company: Thanks for squeezing me in, two quick ones; first, relative to the $27 billion to $30 billion you referenced for spending, what’s your served available market for 2013?
Michael R. Splinter: Roughly half, it’s 51% or 52% I think of that total.
Ben Pang – B. Riley & Company: Okay. And then in terms of the 3D NAND, you mentioned some early shipments, second half of this year, is it easy for the customers to deploy that for planer if they want to or are there significantly different configurations for the tools that they’ve locked in, if they make a decision on 3D NAND right away?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, the customers that are making those early transitions are really focused on the 3D NAND technology, and they are very different. Some of these steps are very different than what you see in planer NAND.
Ben Pang – B. Riley & Company: Thank you very much.
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Ben. And I appreciate your questions. We’d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time today. And we’d like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Tiya, and good afternoon. Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; Gary Dickerson, our Company’s President; and George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer. Today we’ll discuss the results for our first quarter ended January 27. You can find a copy of our earnings release on our website, appliedmaterials.com. We will also find our quarterly financial highlights presentation, which provides additional details. Before we begin, I’d like to share a calendar announcement. Applied plans to hold its next Investor and Analyst meeting on Monday, July 8 in Santa Clara, California. We hope to see many of you here at our headquarters for the event. And now, let me turn the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Applied’s first quarter of fiscal 2013 largely played out as we had expected. Thanks to solid execution and disciplined management of discretionary spending, we delivered $0.06 of non-GAAP earnings per share, which represented the high-end of our outlook. Overall, I’m pleased with how we navigated the bottom of this industry investment cycle and with our semiconductor orders up over 80% in the first quarter, we’re more optimistic about the potential of our markets this year. Implementation of the restructuring plan, we outlined in the fall was progressing well. The actions we are taking include permanent shifts in the costs basis of the company, as well as the substantial reduction in our solar investments. By re-prioritizing our spending, we are able to strengthen customer facing technical resource and accelerate product development programs. This supports our strategic priorities to expand our share in wafer fab equipment and drive profitable long-term growth in display and solar. Now, let me provide an overview of our markets. Global demand for mobile products remain strong, and we expect year-on-year growth of around 35% for smartphones and 55% for tablets. Growth at this level will support solid investment by the foundries and we believe these customers will represent around 45% of wafer fab equipment spending in 2013. Mobile devices are also driving demand for NAND flash memory. However, some of the growth in this market is being suppressed by lower end smartphone and tablet models that are specifically tailored for emerging markets and equipped with less onboard memory. Overall, NAND is growing and we believe that this growth rates will be in the range of 50% for 2013, which is sufficient to support investment in new capacity by the second half of the year. Our development teams are working closely with customers on 3D NAND technology, and when this inflection occurs, it will drive an additional investment cycle by memory manufacturers. The DC market looks to be relatively flat this year as touch-enabled hybrid models verve the lines between traditional laptops and tablets, there is a potential upside to this scenario. For the time being, we remain cautious about logic investment expecting to see a modest increase in spending relative to 2012, primarily due to the timing of factory build outs. DRAM prices are starting to rise, however, we still anticipate DRAM investment remaining at low levels. We are spending limited to technology conversions. In recent weeks, there have been some positive announcements from our largest customers. As a result, we now believe the 2013 wafer fab equipment will be flat to down 10% relative to 2012 spending of around $30 billion. In order to reach the high end of the range, we’ll need to see investment from a broader base of logic and foundry customers in the second half of the year as well as an up tick in land investment. We believe that we can now grow wafer fab equipment in 2013 with share gains driven by strong demand for our transistor products, combined with application wins and inspection and a customer spending mix that’s favorable to applied materials. In display, there is sense of renewed excitement in the TV market with 60 inch and larger models reaching attractive price points, and the introduction of new 4-K resolution. Following a two-year of capacity digestion, we expect investment in new display factories to resume in the second half of the year. Customers are still cautious and the timing of their factory builds will largely depend on their confidence in the macroenvironment. Orders for equipment to manufacturer touch panels and high performance mobile screens remain healthy and production is moving to larger substrate sizes, particularly Gen 6. In solar, end markets continue to grow at between 10% and 20% annually and it looks like overall 2012 installations ended the year at around 31 gigawatts. However, conditions within the supply chain remain extremely challenging with consolidation and rationalization of manufacturing capacity, happening more slowly than we had anticipated. Our approach in solar is to be prudent. We are taking additional steps to scale back our investment until there are clear indications that the market conditions are improving. Before I hand the call over to Gary, I would like to take this opportunity to wish George every success in his new role at Qualcomm and thank him on behalf of every one at Applied for all the contributions he had made to our company during the past 13 years. We are in the process of selecting a successor from a strong pool of internal and external candidates and we expect to appoint a new CFO in the coming weeks. Now, let me hand the call over to Gary for additional comments about our business and strategic priorities. Gary?
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. I would also like to wish George well in his new position at Qualcomm and thank him for everything he has done to help get Applied to the position of financial strength that we enjoy today. As Mike outlined, the expected levels of capital investments by our semiconductor and display customers provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. Also, major trends within these markets create great opportunities for Applied to extend our leadership in precision materials engineering and grow faster than the markets themselves. The most important component of our strategy for profitable growth is to increase our share of wafer fab equipment. In Q1, we built momentum for market share gains by winning several new development tool of record positions at the 20-nanometer node and converted a number of existing positions into volume orders. Demand for better mobile products is driving innovation and we are seeing major inflections in device technology and the introduction of many new materials as customers strive to differentiate themselves with extended battery life, low power, and higher performance products. These inflections are enabled by precision, materials engineering applications, including precision films, material removal, material modification and interface engineering. This is where Applied has clear technology and market leadership, and will be a major factor in driving our growth in wafer fab equipment shares. Over the past three months, we’ve been implementing import organizational changes to strengthen our teams and redeploy funding to accelerate our highest impact growth programs. We have restructured at workforce, we have scaled back our investment in solar, and we’ve carried out an extensive review of our R&D portfolio, stopping programs, where we believe we didn’t have valuable, sustainable differentiation, and increasing funding for programs where we do. As a result, we are shifting approximately $200 million to key strategic priorities that drive profitable growth. Our strategy is to focus on allocating the appropriate level of investments to market segments where we believe we can achieve a leadership position. This means ramping investment in some areas, while reducing or eliminating investments in others. On an ongoing basis, we will look at every aspect of our business through the length of profitable growth and prioritize every dollar toward our best opportunities. One area where we are investing is in field technical resources to upgrade the interfaces between customers, and our R&D teams. By strengthening our field technical teams, we will build stronger customer relationships and ensure we are the company, our customers seek out first to solve their highest value device performance and yield challenges. In addition, we have combined the best product development practices across the company and to-date, we have trained 35 development teams in the application. This is improving our ability to define winning products and increasing the velocity of our development process. Let me now provide an update for each of our businesses. In semiconductor, technology inflections that enable lower leakage transistors, low resistance interconnects, and advanced patterning are expanding our markets in providing a catalyst to grow our share. Our market leadership in the overall transistor module combined with the most significant transistor device technology changes in the last 10 years, creates a great opportunity for Applied Materials. As foundry customers add capacity for the 28-nanometer node and start to ramp 20-nanometer technology, capital intensity is rising in the areas where Applied has the best technology and is a leader. As a result, we expect the strong 2012 performance that we demonstrated in our front-end products, implant, and PVD businesses to continue in 2013. In addition, the adoption of new epitaxy steps at advanced family technology nodes will enable us to further grow our [App] business. We achieved important milestones in our first quarter, winning development and production tool of record selections at our top three customers. The past two years have been a challenging period for our CMP business and we lost market share in 2012 due to an unfavorable customer spending mix, significant improvements to our latest generation tool delivers a clear architectural advantage for advanced nodes and we expect to start recapturing share in 2013. Inspection represents an attractive growth driver for Applied and I am pleased with the progress our team is making. We had very strong customer pole for our wafer inspection and review products last year and we believe foundry and logic wins for our Brightfield tools will translate into continued momentum in 2013. In Etch, we are focusing on key technology inflections in market segments where we believe we have opportunities to deliver technology with sustainable differentiation. With recent new application wins in logic, foundry and NAND flash, we are starting to demonstrate positive momentum. Turning to display, larger TV sizes and 4K Ultra High Definition are important trends that create opportunities for us to increase share. These trends drive larger panels and smaller pixels that increase the value of the device performance and yield advantages of our technology. As 15-inch and larger TVs become a higher percentage of the market, we anticipate more manufacturers will move to Gen 10 substrates. This transition is an important inflection that plays to Applied’s advantage, and will enable us to leverage our leadership and particles and uniformity to gain market share on PVD and extend our leadership in CVD. As we have previously announced, we have taken actions in EES to reduce our costs and restructure the organization. We continue to monitor industry conditions closely and based on our current market view, we decided to further lower our spending beyond the levels discussed in the last earnings call. By the end of this fiscal year, our goal is to reduce EES operating expenses to a run rate below $25 million per quarter. We continue to invest what we can provide differentiated technology to enable higher sell efficiencies and lower cost per watt and remain confident that this business can deliver long-term profitable growth for Applied. In summary, we are optimistic about our opportunities for the year ahead and we are confident that the strategy we are executing will drive profitable growth. We are focused on growing our share of wafer fab equipment and have strong momentum. We are making prudent investments in display and solar and we continue to strengthen the organization in areas that are critical to our success. Let me now hand the call over to George for further details on our performance. George?
George S. Davis: Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. To begin, I would like to thank Mike and Gary for their good wishes and partnership. I would also like to thank Applied’s employees, investors, and the analyst community for the opportunity to work with you. For more than a decade, it has been my privilege to work with some of the best and brightest minds in the industry. and finally, I’m very proud of the finance team at Applied Materials. Now, I will cover our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2013. Orders increased 44% from the prior quarter to $2.1 billion, led by strong demand for semiconductor and display equipment. Our backlog increased 31% to $2.1 billion and our book-to-bill ratio increased to $1.3 billion. Net sales of $1.6 billion were at the high end of our outlook due to stronger than expected performance in SSG. Non-GAAP gross margin was 39.8%, up 1.4 point sequentially despite lower revenue driven by a higher mix of SSG revenue and lower inventory reserves. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $514 million, excluding certain favorable items, our non-GAAP operating expense would have been approximately $535 million in line with our guidance. In Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating expense to increase to $560 billion plus or minus $10 million, reflecting the absence of holiday shutdown savings of $15 million, along with increased investment in SSG partially offset by increased savings from our various cost reduction programs. For the year, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be roughly $2.2 billion, essentially unchanged from 2012. This includes the sizable increase in growth funding for SSG enabled by operating cost improvements related to the workforce reductions announced in October, the EES restructuring and the integration of Varian. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.2% and we now expect a rate of 24% to 26% for the year, an improvement of 1 point from our previous estimates, primarily from the benefit of the R&D tax credit. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.06 were at the high end of the target range led by strong SSG performance and lower operating expenses. The cost today of the workforce reduction program announced in October is $110 million. We now expect the total cost to be in the range of $120 million to $160 million below the original estimate of $180 million to $230 million, the primary reasons for the change in estimates are lower relative participation levels in the voluntary retirement program and a reduced estimate of the final cost of benefits. We expect annual savings and headcount reductions to be within the ranges originally provided. Cash from operations was approximately $16 million, reflecting lower revenue levels, severance payments related to workforce reductions and the timing of annual variable compensation payments. We expect cash from operations to trend back in line with historical performance over the remainder of the year. Cash and investments end of the quarter at $2.8 billion, a sequential decline of $177 million. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be investing an attractive opportunities in our core businesses increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business and utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash. Next, I will comment on our segment results as compared to final quarter. SSG orders were up 84% to $1.4 billion driven by foundry and well above our outlook about more than 25%. 74% of the orders were from three customers, reflecting the concentration of investments in Q1 and our increasing momentum at the largest customers. Net sales increased to 11% to $969 million just above the high end of our outlook with an increase in foundry partially offset by lower NAND revenue. Again, we saw a very high concentration with 75% of revenue from our top three customers. SSG’s non-GAAP operating margin grew to 18.6%. In AGS, orders were down 6% to $544 million. Net sales were down 24% to $471 million, due to the low-end of our outlook, excluding the thin film solar line recognized in the fourth quarter, net sales would have been down 12%. The revenue decline reflected tight customer spending controls as wafer starts in overall utilization rates trended lower for the second consecutive quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin declined to 19.3%. In display, orders increased 66% to $138 million, reflecting ongoing mobility investments and the beginning of resurgence and TV equipment orders. We continue to be optimistic for further TV and mobile equipment order strength in the second half. Net sales in the quarter were $87 million in line with our outlook with the vast majority of revenue from mobile display systems. Non-GAAP operating margin grew to 5.7% demonstrating the Group’s focus on remaining profitable in a low revenue environment. In EES, orders were $68 million primarily due to strength in our wave equipment business while solar equipment orders remain depressed due to ongoing overcapacity issues for our customers. Net sales were $46 million in line with our outlook. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $44 million. We are on track to reduce the quarterly run rate or non-GAAP operating expense to below $30 million by the end of Q2, a 20% reduction from Q1 levels. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Mike for our Q2 outlook. Mike?
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, George. As we look forward to our second quarter, net sales from our semiconductor business should be up 20% to 35%. We expect orders to remain strong approximately at the Q1 levels. Net sales in AGS are expected to be flat to up 10%, reflecting a gradual recovery in wafer starts and utilization levels as the year progresses. We expect net sales and display to be flat to up 25%. Orders are expected to increase by more than 20% with the start of TV capacity additions and continued strength and mobility. Net sales in EES are expected to be approximately flat remaining at low levels. Overall, we expect net sales for the company to be up 15% to 25% and our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.15. Now, let me open the call for questions. Mike.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Mike. And help us reach as many of you as we can free to ask question and no more than one brief follow-up. Tiya, let’s please begin.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence Whalen – Citigroup:  Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations on the strong results and also wanted to pass my congratulations and best of luck after George as well. The first question then I have is related to comment that you made about, foundry spending being about 45% WFE, I believe that the comment you made. As I look at sort of the order profile, it looks like foundry was close to three quarters of your orders. So my question is, how do you see the transition from more foundry dominated order environmental memory order environment, how do you see that evolving and handing off throughout the middle to later part of the year? Thank you.
Michael R. Splinter: Sure, thanks for your questions, very good question. If you look inside our numbers close to three quarters of orders in Q1 are from foundry. As we think about the progression through the year, we do have to have broader foundry participation, but we also need to see logic investment pickup fairly dramatically in the second half along with NAND flash spending for capacity and then for 3D NAND technology. So that’s kind of the progression we should start to see that by the end of our Q2 or the beginning of our Q3 that transition as foundry comes down as a percentage overall in the other areas in WFE starting to rise.
Terence Whalen – Citigroup: Okay, terrific. And then the second question, the follow-up question is around a comment that I believe Gary made around some of the advances in transistor technology in FinFET creating a really good opportunity to gain some share and gain some tool record positions, that seems to be obviously showing up in some of the Taiwan order patterns that we are seeing with Taiwan being very strong. I am wondering if you feel like you have as good a competitive position with the other Korean partner in FinFET? Thank you.
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, if you look at the key enabling technologies for the transistor after PVD implant thermal processes, many of these we have 70%, 75% market share overall. And in the area around the foundry customers that are ramping gate-last technology or FinFET technology, the market share is probably even higher. So this certainly provides a great opportunity for us to grow share. When I think about our overall share position in 2012 in 300 millimeter, we gain share a small amount of market share. We look at 2013 as an opportunity to even accelerate that and 2014 when the 20 nanometer gate-last is adopted by a number of foundry customers. We’ve said that creates an opportunity for our CapEx to go up 30% with those customers. So we’re really in a great position, building momentum through this year into 2014.
Operator: The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Bank of America.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question and my congratulations to George too. The question I had was the first one, Mike if you take your wafer fabric equipment guidance lets assume we get to the upper end of the range driven by higher foundry, NAND coming back, would you still see the seasonality of a (inaudible) that we saw last year?
Michael R. Splinter: This year is certainly a different year than last year, the foundry part of the investment that’s driven by mobility and the mobility consumers that largely buying the latter half of the year really in the fourth quarter. That seasonality is still there. But especially in this kind of odd calendar year, we see more investments in logic to mute that. We think we’ll see more investment in NAND flash this year, which also mutes the accentuated seasonality that we had last year. And I would just echo the point about gaining momentum here as we move into this calendar year with the strong orders that we’re seeing on the front-end from the foundry.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it, that’s very helpful. and then just a quick follow-up for Gary, if I look at the 3D NAND, obviously the memory guys have been working on it for a while and we haven’t seen it yet to put into production. but let’s reveal that maybe it’s a 2014 opportunity, what is the incremental SAM expansion for Applied given the diverse product line?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yeah. So again, we do it as the 2014 timing similar to the 20-nanometer gate last ramp for our customers. So that’s one of things that make us very optimistic about building momentum from a market share perspective. In the 3D NAND technology, there are a number of very long deposition steps if you look at this multilayer stacks, that are very favorable to us. And lastly, we look at the incremental CapEx opportunity for Applied on the order of 25%, it gets better as there are more layers when you’re building these multilayer stacks around 25% increase in CapEx opportunity.
Operator: Your next question will come from Steven Chin with UBS.
Steven Chin – UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Hi, Mike, also nice execution in the quarter and also [congrats] to George too.
George S. Davis: Thank you.
Steven Chin – UBS Securities LLC: My first question is just on the new 2013 WC outlook; I was wondering like you can kind of share more color on what customer type you’re slightly more positive on, and I think originally your estimate was for foundry and logic to be down and memory to be flat to up. Is the change mostly in foundries or this is for 20-nanometer?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, a little more positive there, Steve. It’s not a big change but I would say we’re incrementally more positive as we see the front end of this year and the announcements that some of the major customers have made. We really think DRAM spending is still going to be flat at low-level year-over-year, we think foundry will be down slightly, but perhaps not down as much as we had previously anticipated. And then NAND about 15% of the total with spending profile that stronger in the second half and then logic, we are thinking will be modestly up as well year-over-year. So in total that makes that net sale have us move up from last time we said 5% to 15% down, now we are saying 5% to down 10%. So that’s how we’ve moved in the last few months.
Steven Chin – UBS Securities LLC: Okay thanks.
Michael R. Splinter:  I would like to frankly move into the positive territorial in the next three months, we’ll see how the orders play out here.
Steven Chin – UBS Securities LLC: Can I just have a follow-up to Gary to just about the foundry 20-nm node. You talk about some of the design wins there Gary. What percentage of the decision do you think have been made at the 20-nm foundry node and how do you think Applied is set to compete at 20-nm foundry? Thanks.
Gary E. Dickerson: So I think several have been made, I’m the paranoid person and I’m comfortable once the tool is in the customer’s fab and paid for it. I think that we always have to be aggressive in looking at these types of situations. But certainly I think our order momentum, customers are also buying for multiple technology nodes as you know. So even when we are making 28-nm decisions there, they’re looking to 2016 and future technology nodes and what your position will be there. So I think the strong increase in orders in Q1 for us is a very good sign, certainly the discussions we’ve had with customers have been very positive and we are overall very optimistic, but again it’s not done until the tools are in the fab and take for and so we remain focused until happens.
Steven Chin – UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you very much. Last quarter you saw in a little bit more cautious on the NAND side of the business I think you were saying that there won’t be any need for capacity addition. I hear a little bit more optimism and my question is that driven by what your discussion with your customers or you are more bullish on the end demand and consequently you are more bullish on NAND?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, there are several factors, here (inaudible) modestly more optimistic and I would tell you is the term modestly a couple of things we are of course, seeing strength in pricing for NAND, utilization and factories are improving. We went back and looked at our analysis of how much bid growth you need to see capacity increases and really have readjusted that, so we need to see about 45% bid growth before we seek capacity additions. And that of course, detailed discussions with customers and also we think that 3D NAND is progressing and the initial pilot line orders will come in for 3D NAND before the end of the year. So I think those things all total up to us being a little more positive on NAND flash getting stronger in the second half.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: And Mike, one more question on your CFO search, if you can give us some color on what you are looking internally or externally or what’s the timing we can look for maybe in terms of, then you can bring something and what particularly you are targeting when you’re looking for CFO?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. I have to tell you, we’re really motivated to do this quickly. We have I think a very thorough process between Gary and I and our Board of Directors to ensure that we select the best possible candidate. We think we have several internal candidates and of course, naturally we would rather take an internal candidate than have to go outside, but we think we or for the shareholders throughout this take a look externally. We’re going to try to move through this process in a matter of weeks here, and so we’ll be getting back to you on that topic as soon as we make a decision. As far as what we’re looking for of course, we are looking for a very strong business partners somebody who can think strategically well experienced in financial management and acumen and somebody who can really drive shareholder return for all of our investors.
Operator: The next question will come from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney – Goldman Sachs: Yeah, hi, it’s Mark Delaney calling on behalf of Jim Covello. Let me add my congratulations on the quarter and wish George success in his new role. I was hoping you guys could help understand a little bit more on the reorganization plan? How far along are you on implementing some of those steps and can you share with us what the employee response has been?
Michael R. Splinter: So some of the bigger changes we’ve made, certainly Ali Salehpour coming in and EES and Display was a big change. And I would say that, Ali has been here for two months and the response in internally and also externally has been extremely positive, very bright, very focused on technology leadership, driving profitable growth. Ali has really hit the ground running and he is doing a great job in ESS and Display. Another major change we’ve made is in the SSG organization. We formed a new transistor group within the last month, pulling together all of the different technologies that we have under Steve Dinan. And as we’ve talked about many times that’s really a fantastic opportunity for Applied Materials. And so we’re organizing around that strategy and that will help us in terms of execution on that opportunity. We brought in a lot of really good people to mix with already the tremendous talent we have within Applied Materials, both on the technology and marketing side, and we had just a tremendous team, great opportunities. We’re moving forward at a pretty high pace relative to these changes. So at this point, I would say many of them are in place and again we’re overall very optimistic.
Mark Delaney – Goldman Sachs: That’s helpful, thank you. So my follow-up, I wanted to talk on the announced our plan to reduce cost further at EES. Are there parts of the business that you are actually exiting or are you still going to be addressing the same markets with lower cost footprint?
Michael R. Splinter: We’re not announcing any changes in terms of the products that we have within the EES organization. We certainly driven the cost down pretty dramatically, I think in Q4 2012 we were $45 million, $50 million as we said exiting Q4 2013 and the Solar business will be down to about $20 million. So we’ve cut back in terms of the OpEx spending and that money is being reallocated into some great strategic opportunities we have to grow the company. But really no announcements at this time for any exits of major products within the Solar business.
Mark Delaney – Goldman Sachs: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: The next question will come from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: Hi, thanks for taking my question and I want to wish you good luck George. So actually my first question is for you, particularly your earnings guidance, you kind of imply that you are expecting gross margins to just modestly increase in the coming quarter? I was just wondering why margins are not increasing that much and terms of also kind of just tied to that in terms of OpEx that you expect to – the OpEx guidance yeah, for the coming quarter within your current run rate for the year?
George S. Davis: Yeah. So let me first deal with gross margin. We do expect gross margin to improve in the quarter as we would expect with volume. And if you look at the EPS guidance, basically what you are seeing is all of the benefit from volume and margin improvement in the quarter, so midpoint of the guidance is up $0.06. And we do include in that obviously a significant increase in OpEx, but again on OpEx, you have to look at Q1 as an anomaly. We had 535 if you take out the favorable items in there, but we also had the shutdowns, which meant that our real run rate was much closer to 550. So the rates that were going up at 560 really just reflects incremental funding moving into again, primarily into SSG and I think that rate if you look at the second half of the year will look relatively flat with that rate.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: Great, that was very helpful. And then quick question for you Gary, I think firstly you talk about inspection, you have seen a lot of pools and etch it’s an area that lead a little more time for development rate in terms of regaining shares in those two markets. How do you tasking while two segment for after spending three moments in this company?
Michael R. Splinter: Okay. Let me go through inspection first, obviously this is an area I have a lot of experience. We have a really great team, incredibly strong customer pool in 2012. In wafer inspection and review; we’ve gained a few points of share. We’re winning, we had some good wins in Brightfield inspection with customers here recently that also create a market share momentum for us in 2013 in wafer inspection and review. So again, overall, I would say optimistic on wafer inspection, that’s a very good business for us in contributing profit to the company. In the etch business, also we have a very good team some Customer Portal, some recent wins both in foundry and NAND Flash that make us more optimistic and again, as I’ve said before, both of these markets are multiple segments and our focus is not to blow the ocean, we want to focus to the areas where we can have differentiation and we can establish a strong market share position and we have a very clear strategy in both of these different businesses as inflection happen and some technology changes happen again, I am pretty optimistic in both of these different businesses.
Operator: The next question will come from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmed – Credit Suisse: Hi, this is Farhan calling in for Satya. I wish my best of luck to George as well and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to check on the foundry capacity expectations for this year. If you can just tell like how much 28-nanometer (inaudible) do you expect and how much of 20-nanomee stockare for this year? If you could just tell that – nanometer be very helpful.
Michael R. Splinter: Sure, thanks. As we look at kind of foundry capacity and what we think of the added as we said at the outside of the primarily driven by strong demand in mobile and smartphones and tablets. So on the 28-nanometer area we think between 75,000 and 100,000 wafer starts per month will be added. And in 20-nanometer it’s a little harder to tell, because it also depends on how well those technologies move up the yield curve. Right now we are estimating about 25,000 wafers in 20-nanometer this year and that would be really in the second half – late in the second half of the year.
Farhan Ahmed – Credit Suisse: Thank you. And one question on the inflection and execution, Gary mentioned you have some reasons on (inaudible) I just wondering you understand how important these wins are on the inflection side, is it on 20-nanometer or 28-nanometer if you can just talk about that and whether this is like a small segment in the field or quite a big segment?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, I would say again, the customers are really working with us to cover a very large percentage of the applications for foundry and logic. And in the logic case, actually in both cases more than 50% of the applications, so I wouldn’t say that there are narrow. And again as I talked about earlier, customers will buy for multiple technology node, so they will focus on certainly 28-nanometer in fact, with the running in production today, but again they want technologies that can work for 28, 20, 16 all of these different technology nodes. We are in a very strong position with logic and foundry, especially with advanced transistor technologies and again that’s what makes us optimistic in that business.
Operator: The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.
Mehdi Hosseini – Susquehanna International: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Mike going back to the 3D NAND, can you help us understand what the current throughput is kind of wafer per hour, wafer per day? And at what point 3D NAND would become actually economical? And I have a follow-up.
Michael R. Splinter:  Gary, maybe you can…
Gary E. Dickerson: Yeah. So I think on 3D NAND, I mean there’s a pretty significant increase in density. So I think as soon as the customers have those devices yielding, they’re going to try to ramp in as fast as they can. The biggest issue has been being able to get the yield what they wanted to be. As I said before again, this is a really great opportunity for us, if you look at the number of deposition steps in 3D NAND process, I mean Epi is a pretty low throughput application and you start approaching those types of throughputs on wafers per hour per chamber with some of the 3D NAND application. So again for us 25% increase in CapEx opportunity as customers move to that technology.
Michael R. Splinter: So maybe I would add just briefly here that there is two aspects here. First, 3D is huge trend here not just in NAND but in transistors and packaging. It’s one of the biggest inflections we are going to see over the next few years. But this is a huge change to move away from litho to find shrinking and really be able to move the process defined where precision materials engineering, interface engineering really, really matters and its why we are so excited about this area. And we think at 32 vertical bits are something like this, this is economical at 45, 50 nanometer node where companies are aiming the first generation here. But you have to believe once they solve the device and reliability issues, it will be very easy for them to move very fast both down the litho curve and increase the number of bids in the stock.
Mehdi Hosseini – Susquehanna International: Okay. And then I guess my follow-up for Gary, when you go bid for new business, how should we think about the catalyst that enables you to gain market share? What else is out there other than ASP? Is that the tool throughput, is that the service, is the whole bunch of other stock that you are bundling that is enabling you to gain that market share. I’m asking this because I hear from your customers that the biggest bottlenecks is now lithography. And I just wonder what is enabling you to gain market share other than pricing?
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, again, as we’ve talked about before, the biggest driver in the industry today is mobility. And all of the customers are trying to differentiate on low-power and battery life. The biggest changes we’ve seen in a decade and transistor technology are happening as customers move to 20-nanometer gate-last technology and FinFET. And these are areas where Applied is really riding this way. We have a very high share and the technologies that enable these new transistor structures, maybe Mike can comment. But first time in many, many years that you’ve seen this type of a change, that is the number one focus for the industry where Applied has a leadership position in enabling this capability.
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, I would just add that you know how lithography has been the story for really in the last, at least 10 years. And now we are seeing many of the bottlenecks, the interface engineering, precision materials, how are you going to get the low-k values, how are you going to keep them, and this is really an advantage for Applied Materials.
George S. Davis: And again as we talked about before, this is an increase in our opportunity of around 30%. So again, as you are adding an epi step that’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars with one step that’s added to the transistor. So if you look at all of the technologies, where we have leadership around the transistor, this is really a fantastic opportunity for us to grow share.
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus
Patrick J. Ho – Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you very much. Maybe first for Mike, excluding the largest foundry, how do you see the trends for spending for the second tier foundries or at least the rest of the group in terms of how 2013 plays out?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. Well, certainly we’re expecting return of those other members of the foundry community to start spending in the second half of the year. This will be really a key for us and how our order momentum is occurring at the end of our second quarter. We’ve always expected them to really have their spending in our late Q2 or in the Q2 calendar year and in the Q3 calendar year. So that’s our current expectation on the remainder of the foundry group. I would say we need that spending to broaden out certainly to reach the high-end of our WFE estimate.
Patrick J. Ho – Stifel Nicolaus: Great, that’s helpful. Gary, maybe specifically on the technology side, when you are varying, you brought up the whole materials modification and a lot of technology synergy between iron, implant and etch. Can you maybe give a little bit of color on how some of – now that you two as a combined company, how that maybe giving you an advantage right now and particularly on the etch side and that being a driver of future share gains.
Gary E. Dickerson: Got to say, I kind of feel like a kid in the candy store here in Applied. We again, think to me that it’s so exciting is that we have leadership in many areas of precision materials engineering and this creates tremendous opportunities for us as a company. The one thing that we don’t talk about and unfortunately I can’t talk about here, but there are opportunities for us in the integrated processes, linking different parts of our product portfolio together that are creating positive momentum for us today and I think as you move forward to some of these future device structures and interface engineering and some of these areas becoming more critical, the magnitude of that opportunity is going to increase.
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: The next question will come from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish Iyer – Piper Jaffray: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Congrats George from side as well. So two questions, just wanted to highlight; first, on the logic spending, Mike, you did earlier to the fact that they would probably becoming bad. What is that – which is currently driving could potentially drive logic spending, given that the PC outlook seems to be pretty tempered for this year?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, first of all, it changed to the next-generation of technology where we’re seeing 25% to 35% increase in capital intensity, that movement of course is very important and very relevant to us. But then the other thing that can drive up logic spending is some growth in PCs this year. As I alluded to there has been an introduction of Windows 8. There is our touch Ultrabooks now. If these things start to catch on in the back-to-school time period, this could be very beneficial for us in logic spending in the latter part of the year.
Jagadish Iyer – Piper Jaffray: Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up, I just wanted to understand on the Display side. How should we think about new fabs coming online? Can you give us some color in terms of how many Gen 10 fabs are coming, or is it going to be driven by Gen 8.5? Any color on the fabs and under generation would be very helpful and how Applied is going to be benefited this time versus the prior generations? Thank you.
Michael R. Splinter: Sure, maybe I can start and Gary can finish. On the – as we start this current generation of TV fabs will be Gen 8.5. But what we are seeing in primarily in China, we are starting to see the orders come in for those factories. So that’s really quite beneficial for us. We think that 60-inch TVs are starting to get to the price point that to a real volume price point are now starting to approach a $1,000 very soon, under $1,000. That kind of a price point will drive the industry to Gen 10 just because of how many TVs you can get on one sheet of glass and to make that economical. But it’s pretty clear to us now that while we haven’t had a glass size change in, I guess five years that there is one that’s really going to come. Gary, you might want to talk about with – also with the increased pixel density what we see as our advantages.
Gary E. Dickerson: Yeah, as customers go to larger area, larger panels, and smaller pixels, again it’s the same thing you see in the semiconductor industry, where you have to drive to lower particles to get acceptable yield, uniformity becomes more difficult in these larger areas. And that really plays to the device performance and yield advantages that we have in our CVD and PVD products and that will create very strong momentum for us from a share and margin standpoint in that business.
Michael R. Splinter: And we’ve also really been investing in these next generations of technology as these new fabs eventually convert to metal oxide. We are going to be in a very good position to be able to take advantage of that as well.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Jagadish.
Operator: The next question will come from Ben Pang with B. Riley Caris.
Ben Pang – B. Riley Caris:  Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the growth forecast that you have for the SSG business, you commented on your ability to outgrow the overall sector based on transistor and PDC, what’s the – I guess the wafer fab equipment if you split out transistor by itself? Is there a significant difference between 2013 and 2012?
Gary E. Dickerson: Transistor products I think are little over 50% of our total SSG business I think it’s roughly that in plant.
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah.
Ben Pang – B. Riley Caris: So I mean in terms of the industry growth rate is there – I am just trying to get a feel for 28-nanometer versus 20-nanometer, how much is really going to the transistor, is there a big growth difference?
Gary E. Dickerson: Again, what we are seeing for the transistors you go from 28-nanometer to 20-nanometer gate-last, the market opportunity goes up for us roughly 30% if you think an equivalent number of wafer start and then it goes up again maybe another 10% as you go to FinFET technology. So that’s again for equivalent number of wafer starts.
Ben Pang – B. Riley Caris: Okay, thank you very much and good luck to George as well.
George S. Davis: Thank you so much.
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks. And yeah I think we have time for one more question please.
Operator: Yes, sir. The final question will come from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah – Deutsche Bank: Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask you a question on the OpEx guidance, does this guidance include spending on 450 millimeter or are you sort of thinking about 450 millimeter later this year or early next year?
Michael R. Splinter: It does. It’s our full OpEx picture.
Vishal Shah – Deutsche Bank: Okay, great. And then on the foundry spending expectations, when you think about the orders for the next couple of quarters, what percentage of your orders do you expect from 20-nanometer, I mean they are all going to be second half rated, or do you see some activity from customers even in the first half?
Michael R. Splinter: We think orders on 20-nanometer are certainly going to be, maybe we’ll see them in the fourth quarter drives in our fiscal first quarter as we think most of that capacity will be growing in mostly for the end of the year.
Vishal Shah – Deutsche Bank: Great. And just I mean how do you think 2014 foundry spending looks like, I mean do you see 20-nanometer keeping foundry spending relatively high, or do you see that is an area of weakness when you think about in the next year?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, I think we’ll hold off, but the mobility trends we believe is here to say, and I think you’re still will be strong growth in mobility of – that’s the case we’re going to see some foundry spending, a little too early for us to make a protection about 2014 right now.
Gary E. Dickerson: What I would say also…
Vishal Shah – Deutsche Bank: I appreciate it.
Gary E. Dickerson: Again on mobility, this is the major focus for our customers is where everyone is trying to differentiate in brad share and certainly looks like customer ramp 20-nanometer gate-last processes. The people that are there ramping those processes will have a competitive advantage and that’s what we would anticipate in 2014.
Vishal Shah – Deutsche Bank: I appreciate, guys. Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Okay, thank you, Vish. And we would like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 pm Pacific time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

Reconciliations to GAAP measures are contained in today's earnings release and in the financial highlight slides, which are on the Investor page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Marly, and good afternoon. Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; Gary Dickerson, our company's President; George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Sweeney, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Today, we'll discuss the results for our fourth quarter and year ended October 28. You can find a copy of our earnings release on our website, appliedmaterials.com, where you'll also find our quarterly financial highlights presentation, which provides additional detail. Let me now hand the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In our fourth quarter, Applied posted profits at the high end of our outlook, despite challenging industry conditions in semiconductor, solar and display. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Applied Materials team. Their focus and commitment resulted in the company delivering $8.7 billion of revenue and $0.75 of non-GAAP earnings per share for the year. Our strong cash flow performance allowed us to increase our quarterly dividend and share buybacks, returning $1.85 billion to shareholders. Since completing the Varian acquisition, we have made excellent progress with integration. Exiting the year, we have realized over $50 million of run rate synergy savings, well ahead of our target. In addition, we have deployed key talent from the Varian management team to new roles in the company. In June, Gary Dickerson joined as our new president to bring renewed focus on our growth strategy. Gary is leading important changes that will strengthen our product development capabilities, and he will provide details in a few minutes. 2012 was a year characterized by significant fluctuations in seasonality and demand for semiconductor equipment, coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar. We see improving business conditions entering 2013, with orders projected to increase after bottoming in the fourth quarter. In semiconductor, the mobility trend remains the biggest influence on industry spending, with annual smartphone sales expected to surpass 700 million units and tablet sales to grow in excess of 100% year-on-year. Increased competition is fueling innovation throughout the supply chain, and we see demand for advanced application processors, driving the foundries to build out their 28-nanometer capacity and ramp investment for the 20-nanometer node. We expect healthy investment by foundry customers in 2013, albeit at a lower level than 2012. Although growth in mobile is also driving demand for memory, the adoption of cloud-based storage means that we are seeing only a modest increase in the average bits per box. And consequently, NAND bit growth is projected to be in the 50% per year range. Given the low level of NAND capacity investment, there is potential for increased spending in the second half of 2013. DRAM spending is expected to continue at low levels, and we anticipate total memory to remain approximately 25% to 30% of wafer fab equipment investment next year. Soft macroeconomic conditions, combined with the timing of Windows 8, resulted in subdued back-to-school PC sales, and we expect negative PC growth for the calendar year. As a result, we are tempering our expectations for logic spending in 2013. However, the release of new touch-enabled ultrabooks can spur PC growth, providing a potential upside for both logic and DRAM investment. We now believe wafer fab equipment spending will end the year in the $30 billion to $32 billion range. Based on our expectations of a pullback in logic and foundry spending and continued weakness in memory, we see 2013 wafer fab equipment investment down 5% to 15% or falling in a range of $26 billion to $30 billion. We foresee consumer buying patterns and customer concentration again driving seasonality in the demand profile. In Q1, we expect wafer starts and utilization rates to trend lower for the second consecutive quarter, further impacting our service business revenue. In Display, this was the weakest year for TV investment in the history of the LCD industry. Despite low revenue levels, our Display group executed well and remained profitable in every quarter. Supply and demand is coming back into balance, and equipment orders are picking up. We are seeing a significant increase in average TV sizes, up to 2 inches year-on-year, compared to a typical increase of 0.5 inch per year. In addition, there is strengthening demand in the emerging markets. Together, we believe these factors will support industry investments in a range of $8 billion to $10 billion next year and provide a catalyst to build out factories in China. Mobility-related markets represented over 80% of our display revenue for the year, and we expect capacity investments for high-resolution mobile displays and touch panels to remain robust, as smartphones and tablet shipments grow and as these technologies migrate to ultrabook PCs. In Solar, the industry is on track to install over 30 gigawatts in 2012, and we expect double-digit growth of the end market to continue. This demand growth is starting to consume excess manufacturing capacity within the supply chain. However, today, conditions for our customers are extremely challenging, and investment in new capacity remains very low. Until we see clearer signs that solar equipment demand is recovering, we will take additional steps to reduce our cost structure and associated losses. Looking forward to 2013, we are optimistic about the potential of our markets. In all the industries we serve, we see accelerated changes in device technology and the adoption of new materials. This increasing complexity provides opportunities for Applied to build on our leadership and grow our market share. We recently announced a restructuring plan that will free up significant resources to fund the product development needed to support our customers' roadmap and drive Applied's growth. Our strategic priorities for the year ahead are clear. We'll focus on growing our share of wafer fab equipment. We'll make prudent and targeted investments in Solar and Display, and we will continue to strengthen the organization in areas that are critical to our success. Now let me hand the call over to Gary for additional comments about our business segments and strategic priorities. Gary?
Gary E. Dickerson: Thanks, Mike. And I'd like to start by adding my thanks to our employees for their achievements in 2012. Since joining Applied, I've been very impressed with the talent, strong customer relationships and outstanding technology I've seen across the company. Together, these provide a tremendous foundation for growth. I believe we have a significant advantage in the depth and breadth of our expertise, and I'm delighted to be a part of this great team. Over the past 4 months, I've been spending a large portion of my time with customers, and I'm excited by the opportunities they are sharing with us. In Semiconductor, Display and Solar, our customers are accelerating changes in device technology and new materials. As a result, there are increasing numbers of device performance and yield challenges that fall in our leadership areas of precision materials engineering, creating great growth opportunities for Applied Materials. In order to drive growth and increase shareholder value, we are focused on 3 strategic priorities. Our #1 priority is to grow our share in wafer fab equipment. To support this objective, we will increase investment, focusing on 300-millimeter R&D and building a stronger technical team in the field. In Display and Solar, we are investing to extend our leadership in enabling technologies. But as Mike said, until solar market conditions improve, we are implementing a significant reduction in our operating expenses to mitigate the impact of this business on our earnings. We are also extending our planning horizon, and we'll make incremental investments in technical capabilities and R&D programs in current and new markets, where we see clear opportunities to leverage our precision materials engineering leadership and drive profitable growth. To fund our strategic priorities, we have conducted a comprehensive review of spending across the company. As a result, we have been able to identify approximately $200 million that could be made available for growth programs. We have stopped programs where we don't believe we have valuable sustainable differentiation or cannot deliver a good return on investment, and we will continue to review our R&D portfolio and shift investment to our best opportunities. In Solar, we will reduce our operating expenses, going significantly beyond our previously announced plans for this business. Additionally, we are restructuring our workforce through a voluntary retirement program, as well as reduction in force. Beyond reprioritizing our investments, we are implementing changes to the organization and our business processes to upgrade our product development engine to make it more effective and more efficient. These changes will ensure that we develop products with an architectural advantage in device performance, yield and cost. They will also enable us to accelerate development of disruptive technology and time-to-market for new products. Now let me briefly outline the opportunities for each of our businesses. In Semiconductor, the mobility trend is driving customers to deliver high-performance, low-power processors and affordable solid-state storage in a small form factor. This translates to major inflections in lower leakage transistors, low-resistance interconnects, advanced patterning, wafer-level packaging and 3D NAND flash technology. These inflections create spending shifts that are favorable to Applied, as well as high-value device performance and yield challenges that we can address with our technology. As foundries transition to 20 nanometer, they will fully adopt high-k gate-last transistor technology. This moves right into the sweet spot of Applied's leadership areas, and we expect a greater-than-30% increase in our available market. 2013 is a critical positioning year for 20 nanometer, with many process tool of record decisions being made that will impact our future market share. Our organization is focused on winning these decisions, and we anticipate strong growth for our PVD, epitaxy, implants and inspection products. As a result of rising capital intensity in the transistor area, our Front End Products Group, which includes our epitaxy products, posted record revenue in 2012. We expect continued strength in this business as new Epi steps are added to foundry device flows. The move to gate-last transistors also supported the strongest year in a decade for our PVD business. Strength we believe will continue, as customers add new PVD steps to their 20-nanometer processes. Looking ahead to technology changes that will happen in the next 12 to 24 months, we are focusing our investments on key inflections, including 3D finFET, 3D NAND and extending the interconnect roadmap beyond 20 nanometers. These inflections expand our market and provide opportunities for share gains. For example, 3D NAND structures require multiple film deposition steps, which leverages our advantage in depositing very thin film with precise control. In addition, we expect strong growth in selective material deposition and removal. Beyond our core leadership areas, our Inspection and Etch businesses provide opportunities for growth. The inspection market includes many segments, some where we are strong such as defect review and others where progress has been more difficult. We have been adding technical and marketing talent to our team and have substantial customer pull for our Inspection products, including our latest generation Brightfield tool. We have recently penetrated new applications in advanced logic, foundry and memory, and these positions provide a platform for us to grow share in the inspection market. Etch is a large multi-segment market, and our actions have been to build a stronger team and product development in the field. We are focusing this team and our investments in areas where we believe we have differentiated solutions, which are primarily in conductor etch. The customer penetrations we're making in patterning, NAND flash and packaging applications provide a good opportunity for us to grow our share in etch. Turning now to Display. The transition to new technologies, specifically metal oxide transistors and low-temperature polysilicon for organic LED and high-resolution LCD, is challenging for our customers. To address these inflections, we recently introduced a new PVD tool that enables the formation of higher-stability metal oxide transistors and a suite of CVD tools that address customers' requirements for advanced film. We expect the next generation of factories for high-definition televisions and mobile displays to ramp with technologies that increase Applied's market for our CVD and PVD products by at least 30%. In Solar, we remain confident in this market as an attractive long-term growth driver for the company. Our current product portfolio, as well as new technology and development is focused on enabling higher cell efficiency and driving much lower cost per watt. With this portfolio, we believe we can capture approximately $100 million of revenue for each gigawatt of new capacity the industry adds. The combination of our strong field team and product leadership puts us in a great position when customer investment resumes. However, as long as the current market conditions exist, we will significantly scale back our investment in this business. In summary, as we refine our plans in the year ahead, our direction is clear. We will implement the organizational and portfolio changes required to fully fund our largest growth opportunities. We will expand our planning horizon to make sure we win future technology inflections, and we will focus on converting our development tool of record positions at the 20-nanometer technology node into volume orders. Let me now hand the call over to George for further details on our performance and outlook. George?
George S. Davis: Thank you, Gary, and welcome to everyone on the call today. In our fourth fiscal quarter, Applied delivered revenue of $1.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.06, the upper end of our outlook. Fourth quarter GAAP results included the charges of $124 million related to our workforce actions and a $421 million impairment of EES goodwill. These actions, coupled with $0.06 of acquisition-related charges, resulted in a GAAP loss of $0.42 per share. Full year GAAP earnings were $0.09 per share, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.75. Orders in the fourth quarter declined 19% from the prior quarter to $1.5 billion, reflecting lower semiconductor equipment demand, partially offset by modest order increases in our other segments. Net sales decreased 30% to $1.6 billion, led by a greater-than-40% reduction in semiconductor equipment sales. Non-GAAP gross margin declined to 38.4%, primarily due to lower volumes, inventory reserves and lower factory absorption. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $518 million, below our $545 million target, primarily due to accrual adjustments for variable compensation and other employee-related costs. For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in a range of $525 million to $545 million. During the quarter, we took a number of actions across the company to enable increased funding for our critical priorities. These actions include further reductions in solar spending, the workforce restructuring, varying synergies and the reprioritization of existing spending. In total, we expect these actions will make available approximately $200 million in 2013 for critical programs and new capabilities that support our highest ROI opportunities. Our focus is on funding to grow share and expand our markets. I will now cover the expected financial impact of the voluntary retirement program and reduction in force actions announced in the quarter. When fully completed, these actions will make available more than $140 million annually for new investments. The total cost for this program is expected to be between $180 million and $230 million. We incurred a charge of $106 million in the quarter for the program and expect the majority of the remaining GAAP charges to be incurred primarily in the first half of 2013. The impairment of EES goodwill recognized in the fourth quarter reflects the deterioration of the solar equipment market and our customers' financial condition, coupled with lower market valuations. These factors led the company to reassess the recoverability of EES goodwill. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 26.2%. We expect our fiscal 2013 rate to be in line with 2012 and within a range of 25% to 27%. Cash from operations was $411 million, reflecting our continued focus on working capital and the impact of lower revenue. Share buybacks in the fourth quarter amounted to $516 million or 3.6% of the shares outstanding, and we paid dividends of $111 million or $0.09 per share. For the fiscal year, we repurchased 126 million shares or just under 10% of shares outstanding at an average price of $11.22 and paid dividends of $434 million. Given the cash requirements for severance and variable compensation programs in Q1, we expect our share repurchase for that quarter to be at a reduced level. Cash and investments ended the quarter and our fiscal year at $3 billion. We are entering 2013 in a strong position, following a year in which we completed the $4.2 billion Varian acquisition and returned $1.85 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchase. Next, I will comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were down 36% to $741 million, driven primarily by a lower foundry and NAND bookings, partially offset by logic. Net sales decreased 44% to $870 million, in line with our outlook, with declines across foundry, memory and logic customers. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin was 10.9%. In AGS, orders were up 8% to $576 million, reflecting the seasonal effect of annual contract renewals. AGS net sales were up 7% to $621 million. This result includes $85 million for a thin-film solar line. Excluding this item, revenue would have been down 7% on lower wafer starts and utilization rates in semiconductor factories. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.5%. In Display, orders increased modestly to $83 million. Net sales for Display were $93 million, with mobility investments again accounting for the majority of revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin was 4.3%, as the segment remained profitable despite the low levels of revenue in the quarter. In EES, orders increased to $65 million, led by orders for our WEB Coating tools with solar equipment orders remaining at depressed levels due to ongoing overcapacity issues and cash [ph] conservation by our customers. Net sales were approximately $62 million, at the mid-point of our outlook. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $46 million. We expect losses to narrow throughout the fiscal year, as we reduce the combined OpEx run rate for the solar and WEB businesses to below $30 million per quarter by the second half of fiscal 2013. This new OpEx level reflects a nearly 50% reduction from where we started in 2012, while absorbing the solar implant spend, which had remained at SSG for the first year of integration, but now will be reported in EES. Next, I'll turn to our outlook for Q1. Net sales from our Semiconductor business should be in the range of flat to up 10%. We expect orders to be up more than 25%, as customers prepare to increase capacity. Net sales in AGS are expected to be down 15% to 25%, reflecting the absence of the thin-film solar revenue of $85 million we received in fiscal Q4 and the effects of lower factory utilization. Excluding the thin-film solar revenue, net sales would be down 5% to 15%. We expect net sales in Display to be flat to down 30% off a low base. We are seeing the beginning of the order ramp to support LCD capacity additions in China, with display orders expected to exceed $150 million in our Q1. Net sales in EES are expected to be down greater than 30%, again, off a very low base. Overall, we expect net sales for the company to be flat to down 15%, and non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of 0 to $0.06 per share. Now, Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, George. [Operator Instructions] Marly, let's, please, begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Mike, the first question I had was, when you look at the order rebound in the January quarter, how much do you think is driven off just from a seasonal bounce off these low levels in October versus actually a true cyclical uptick? And who -- which segment, whether it's NAND, logic, foundry, is actually driving that uptick in Jan quarter?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. Thanks, Krish. I think we've seen the SSG business be quite seasonal and orders have been starting to show up in Q1 for the last few years. And, kind of, the order and revenue pattern has been, at least in our fiscal year, stronger in Q2, Q3; weaker in Q1 and Q4. I think this is quite a similar pattern to that, and the uptick is primarily in foundry and logic spending.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: If I could just have a quick follow-up for Gary. Thanks for giving the priorities for the company. You highlighted conductor etch. I'm just kind of curious, any plans on the dielectric etch business? If I do the math, you probably generated a little over $100 million in revenues last year in that segment and very low market share. So what are your priorities for the dielectric etch?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. Maybe let me talk about etch overall. We're shifting our R&D investment in etch to areas where we have the largest opportunities and focusing on areas where we have the most pull from customer -- customers and the highest probability of success. Etch is a large multi-segment market. The strongest position for us is in conductor etch, where we have differentiated technology leading to new penetrations that give us a great opportunity to grow share. There are some applications. Again, etch has many different segments. There are some applications within dielectric where we have a strong position. We're seeing very strong pull from customers. And we definitely will pursue those. But the biggest opportunity for us is in conductor etch. I'd also like to say about the team -- is we've added some major additions to this organization. I really like working with this team and believe we have a great opportunity to grow share in this market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS Securities.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First question for Gary. Gary, you talked about share gains as your #1 priority, and you also had a chance to do a strategic review. The question is, are you at a point where you think you have done a strategic view of the entire silicon business and the other businesses? And are you willing to share what your maybe near- to mid-term share gain goals are in etch and inspection?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. Let me just give an overview. As we talked about earlier, we've made significant reductions in OpEx to focus on growing our share in wafer fab equipment. And as I said earlier, this is the #1 focus for the company. If you look at what is going to happen over the next 2 years that will have a big impact on our performance, it's really the 20-nanometer transition. And this transition is really focused on the transistor, low leakage, low power, high performance. And this is in the sweet spot of our leadership in transistor equipment technology. As I said earlier, we anticipate in this transition, significant growth in Epi, PVD, implant and inspection in this 20-nanometer transition. The transition creates a great opportunity for us to grow our available market and increase share. We also -- there are also a number of other device technology inflections that are good for Applied, and this is where the majority of our spending is being focused. Within SSG, we've shifted a large amount of R&D dollars to focus on areas with the best returns, some of those we talked about earlier in the call. So I would say, again, overall, I'm optimistic -- very optimistic with the major transition that will impact our business being right in the sweet spot of our leadership position. And overall, I think we have a great opportunity to grow share. I don't -- we're not going to give specific market share goals in all of the different segments. But I do believe, based on customer pull and penetrations that we're making, that we have a good opportunity to grow share in those businesses.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And one question for Mike. Mike, a question on the 2013 WFE. You had previously said you expect a similar seasonality at 2012 into 2013. So should we expect a much stronger first half '13 as we come out of the second half '12?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, thanks. When we look at wafer fab equipment spending for all of '13, it's a little bit hard to tell right now what the second half will look like. I really think the big part of that is how the macro environment plays out, economic environment plays out and, more specifically, how well PCs do in that environment because that could stoke spending, both in logic and DRAM for the second half. The first half, we will see logic increase, as I mentioned, but we'll also see the foundry spending profile. And as I said, that for us is second quarter and third quarter of our fiscal year. So that kind of plays in -- cuts across first half and second half calendar year, but generally stronger in the first half. Overall, I would say, as we look at the total WFE, we think it will be weaker next year based on lower foundry and logic spending.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, first question, Mike, can you talk a little bit about visibility, in particular, to the foundry logic uplift that you're seeing and, I guess, importantly, how that may have changed in the last week to month? Because it sounds like maybe things are getting incrementally better.
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. I think, actually, we would say, from our projection -- our original projection last quarter was that we thought WFE for 2013 was going to be a little bit stronger, especially in logic. I think we've lowered our expectations on growth in logic spending. I think our expectations on foundry are pretty much where they were. We thought that it would be down off a high peak in 2012. Now the -- if we look at our seasonality picture that we've seen now for 2 years in a row, we start to see orders grow for SSG products in Q1. We believe that's what we're seeing today. It is not -- we don't believe it will be as accentuated as it was last year with such a high peak in Q2 and dropping in Q3. A little hard to tell right now, but maybe a little more muted trend than we saw last year.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then, if I could ask a follow-up. Gary, thank you very much for the color. I guess a question in terms of magnitude of share gain and timing wise -- and I get you don't want to put numbers around that. But I'm just curious, when you think about the inflection at the transistor level at 20-nanometer and how AMAT is really at the sweet spot there, plus new investments in hiring as well as investments in field services, what will drive the most share gain near term? And then, how do you think about the layer in of other share gain from those other levers as you invest in the business?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes. Again, the 20-nanometer is really the major focus over the next couple of years. It will -- some 20-nanometer investment will hit towards the end of 2013, the majority in 2014. And as I said, it's really focused on the transistor, and this is where we have clear leadership in a number of different enabling products. So we've seen record performance in Epi, best performance in PVD in a decade. Certainly, there are more steps that are being added in this 20 -- the full adoption of high-k gate-last 20-nanometer processes that will fuel significant growth in those businesses. Implants and inspection, also, we have a really good position in 20-nanometer based on our DTOR positions with customers. So that's really the major focus for us and the major opportunity for us. And as I said, it's a more than 30% increase in our available market and really right in the leadership areas that we have as a company. So we look at this as being one of the best transitions that's happened for Applied Materials in many, many, many years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: On the Solar piece, what's the difference between what you're doing and sort of getting out of the business entirely? It seems like there's a very significant scaling back of the effort here. I mean, what's left?
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, as we -- as Mike talked about earlier today, we certainly anticipate that end market demand is going to continue to increase over time. And we can add about $100 million per gigawatt of new capacity, given a reasonable market. This can be a good business for Applied Materials. We have a strong position in technology to enable higher cell efficiency, enabling lower cost per lot, and a real advantage in products that are important to making this happen. The spending reductions -- there's always a balance in these types of situations. We clearly understand that we need to reduce the drag on earnings, impact on the company overall. But we also want to be investing when this market returns. We have a very strong position, and we still think this can be a good business for us.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: The next question, it's going to -- at the risk of sounding a little bit like pandering here. You guys seem to be seeing the market a little more clearly than some of your competitors. At SEMICON, when you guys kind of had a -- announced a more dour market outlook, a lot of people said, "That's just AMAT losing share." And then, lo and behold, over the next 2 quarters, they were all missing numbers and guiding down to where you guys already were. Now your competitors are insisting on a flat to up market next year, and you guys are calling it, I think, more consistent with what the customers are saying, which is down 10% or so. Why do you think you're seeing it a little sooner than your customer -- or than your competitors in this cycle?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, Jim, I think we really try to go out and talk to the customers and understand what their investment profile is. We really do take this item seriously because we have to plan our business around where we believe wafer fab equipment spending is going to end up. And I think that's the primary aspect. But I think, overall, our planning team has a good approach to figure out really what the puts and takes are on figuring out what's driving the market as well. When you think you have negative PC growth, I think, there's an aspect to the logic spending that we have to take into consideration and how much impact that then has in particular on DRAM spending. George, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.
George S. Davis: No, I think -- I appreciate the comment. And one of the things that we see -- we tend to have an extra month because we have fiscal quarters. And we often will see a change in the order pattern and we try and get it out as quickly as we can. And I think that's what you saw at SEMICON. And we wish we had better news back then. We wish we hadn't been right but...
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I just wanted to see, Mike, if you can give us an incremental breakdown on where you see the relative spending in SSG next year, given the down 5 to 15?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. I think maybe I can be helpful if I look at the top end of the range and the bottom end of the range. On the top end of the range, we would have to see a return of strength in PCs, a big -- pretty big uptake in ultrabooks. I think that's possible. There's some compelling models out there. That would drive increase in logic and DRAM spending. And then we would expect 3D NAND to come in a little stronger probably than we're projecting right now, as that technology gets ready for production. On the downside, I would say, first of all, on the downside, we would have to expect that the overall world economy is not good and not as maybe as good as it is today. And then continued slide in PC sales, which we're not expecting in our current model. I think that would be the big aspects. And then when you look at the segments inside of spending, we think foundry and logic spending are going to be down modestly next year, kind of in that 10% range. And then memory spending is pretty much going to be flattish at a low level of 25% to 30% of overall wafer fab equipment spending. With some bias, that NAND spending could go up later in the year, but I think it's too early to call that.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then I had a quick question on the OpEx maybe throughout -- this next fiscal year. Obviously, you're reducing some expenses in what you consider some noncritical areas. But in the end, when you think about the restructuring of the EES division and some of these cuts, I mean, should we assume that you're just simply going add OpEx cost back for areas of growth? Or at a given level of revenue, say, 12 months from now, we do expect a lower level of OpEx associated with the company?
George S. Davis: Our real focus right now is on making sure that we're fully funding the growth opportunities that we see. I think Gary laid out pretty clearly also the opportunities that we see to gain market share over the next 12 to 18 months. And we want to make sure that funding is not the issue there. So we are taking significant actions. We do think, as we said, that it frees up $200 million of investable funds relative to what we saw in 2012. Now some of that will net out at the end of the day, but we would expect really all of the -- for planning purposes, I would expect all of the restructuring savings to go back into spending.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just following up on the seasonality comment. Is it fair to say that last year, when you had this very strong first half, that was the big component was Korea. And this time, it's less Korea. So if we -- that drove the most seasonality last year than compared to this year?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, it kind of gets down to specific customer expectations. I would just say that it's primarily -- the seasonality is still primarily consumer driven, smartphone driven, consumer cycle driven. And so, as much capacity increase that's needed in that area will likely will see those sales, orders and sales in the first half of the year.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Just one more follow-up. I'm just wondering your forecasting, if it's more top-down driven or more your visibility from the customer. Because what surprises me is that last year, when the NAND was in oversupply and the prices were declining 20% quarter-over-quarter, most of the companies were pretty bullish on NAND spending. And now, we have prices stabilizing to going up. And I hear a very, very muted outlook. So I'm just wondering what am I missing? Why the outlook this way?
Michael R. Splinter: For us, on NAND, the issue is that right now, our bit growth projection is about 50%. And to really get a need for increased wafer capacity, we believe you have to get that bit growth above 70%. So that's the reason that we do see that supply and demand is coming. Customers have taken actions to get supply and demand into much, much better balance in flash memory. But our thinking is that they're going to be able to achieve a 50% bit growth through technology improvements, moving to the next generation of technology as opposed to building new factories and facilitizing those factories and adding wafer starts. We'd love to see solid-state drives really take off next year. That could happen with ultrabooks. And that would certainly drive that bit growth above 70% and then require more investment there. But that's kind of our rationale that, I think, is consistent with the view. .
George S. Davis: And when you look back to 2012 and the forecasts that were coming out, it really was a bottoms-up talking to our customers and to the signals that our account teams were seeing. And what you saw is in the second half of the year, customers pulled back. And everybody was very encouraged by the smartphone growth expectations for the year, tablet growth expectations. And what you just didn't see was bit growth within the device. And so you just didn't get the growth, particularly with a week, solid-state drive market in '12 that people have hoped for. And that's the world we're kind of entering 2013 with.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Just on memory spending. If I look at the October quarter orders, your orders are below 100 million. That's consistent with, I think, the orders that you saw back in 2009. So I'm just wondering, what kind of profile you see for orders, especially if you think memory orders are going to be flattish next year? And then same thing on logic. If you look at the October quarter orders, they almost doubled last quarter, from last quarter. And if your orders are going to go up again in the first quarter, then are we looking at another similar sort of sharp decline in orders in the back half of the year?
Michael R. Splinter: I think it's way too early to forecast the back half of 2013 right now. There's just too many puts and takes. If capacity demand was all about smartphones and consumer products, I think we could make a better projection. But I think there's a real chance for Windows 8 PCs to be stronger in the year and therefore drive more spending, which would change the profile half-over-half. Other than that, I think, memory spending, it's kind of chugging along the bottom. And I don't think the fluctuations are going to be that great other than, as I said, we could see strengthening in NAND the second half of the year. But I don't think it's going to be a big impact on the seasonality or variability in the first half of the year.
George S. Davis: We still see memory orders combined less than 20% of the expected orders for our Q1. Actually, memory or DRAM will be up quarter-over-quarter but it's off such a low base, it's just not material to the overall outlook.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's very helpful. Just one other question. In the down 15%, 5% to 15% year, how should we think about AMAT's revenue overall, especially considering some of the puts and takes in Display and EES?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, nominally, it -- our SSG revenue will follow wafer fab equipment, plus whatever share gains that we have. And we feel quite bullish about 20-nanometer. But 20-nanometer is going to be maybe 25,000 or 30,000 wafer starts in 2013. So we'd see that in that latter part of the -- of that effect in the latter part of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar with Crédit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I just wanted to probe you a little bit on the foundry expectations for next year. I was wondering if you can -- if you look a bit in the foundry segment and across the different customers, are you seeing like most of the decline coming across just one particular customer? Or do you see a broad-based trend?
Michael R. Splinter: I would say it's not a broad-based trend, Satya. But I think I'd probably leave it at that.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And just one more question on foundry. Like, if the foundry -- if you look at the foundry utilization at leading edge, do you see they are changing? I mean, from what we hear, it's still at a very tight supply/demand dynamics there. And the logic content continues to grow, there's fundamentally no change. And the units also are continuing to grow on the mobility side. So I was just wondering, like is the view that next year, foundry could -- would be declining. Just off the reflection of the current outlook from your customers, even when you look at it from a top-down level, things could be a little better next year?
George S. Davis: Yes. This is George. If you look at year-over-year, foundry will still be far and away the strongest part of the demand from our customers. But it will be down. And our expectation today is that overall foundry spending will still be down and is a contributor to the reduction overall in WFE.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Two questions. Gary, first, given your expertise in process control, can you talk about where are some opportunities in process control? What are some low-hanging fruits? And what are some real term -- long-term opportunities where Applied can make a big impact? And I have a follow-up.
Gary E. Dickerson: Okay, in -- I would start by saying I've never seen a business with more customer pull than our PDC business. And we're shifting our investment into areas where we have the largest opportunities and most pull from customers. The areas that we're making incremental penetrations are in inspection and logic, foundry and memory, especially in logic and foundry, we see some traction. So that would be the area, I think, that is the biggest opportunity for us. But again, in my career, I've never seen a market or a business with more customer pull than the PDC business.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: This is a follow-up for George. So, George, given that you allocate more resources now as you kind of reshift the resources, how should we think about the operating margin of the silicon segment as it bounces up in 2013 compared to your prior cycle?
George S. Davis: When we set the models for performance at the last meeting or at the last analyst meeting, we had brought the models down somewhat in semiconductor to reflect the expected increase in spending. I think, overall, we'll still be operating within our model range as a company, both at the segment and at the overall level.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just first off. Historically, Applied has been very well exposed to the DRAM side in terms of memory. With 3D NAND approaching and being adopted in the next several years, I guess, a 2-part question, where do you see the TAM for Applied? And what market segments do you see the biggest growth opportunities?
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, Patrick. We see 3D NAND really as a great opportunity for us. On this multilevel, stack type of process, there are many very precise film deposition steps where we have leadership and some additional high aspect ratio etching also, where we've had good customer pull, additional CMP steps. So overall, the 3D NAND we see as an opportunity that can grow our available market more than 25%. So we look at this as really, really a great opportunity. It's really in the sweet spot of our precision materials engineering and our leadership and deposition.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Great. And my second question. Given some of the issues with EUV at this point and the adoption rate for that process technology. How do see those delays, I guess, impacting Applied, I guess, on the positive side, in terms of additional tool sales or the move to multiple patterning. How does that help you over the next few years?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, good question. So the double or quad patterning does represent an opportunity for us in that many of the patterning films, we have a very strong position. So we see that as an opportunity, and we also have some pull from customers in etch for some of these films. But certainly, the deposition side of it is a good opportunity. And again, some incremental opportunity in the patterning etch.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: First question is for Gary. Regarding your comment on the 20-nanometer. I would suspect that given some of the fabless expect to start investing in the second half of 2013, that some of the DTOR position might have already been won or at least secured. Can you kind of quantify where we are at in terms of those position being already awarded versus opportunity that you guys can still go after? I just want to kind of get a sense of where we are in terms of that opportunity there.
Gary E. Dickerson: Sure. Yes, no, as I said, again, 20-nanometer is really our primary focus and certainly will be a really big opportunity for Applied Materials. And this is, as I said, really all about the transistor, low leakage, low power, high performance and really in a sweet spot of where we have leadership in transistor equipment technology. So we see ourselves as being very well-positioned. The pull from customers is very, very strong, since we have a lot of the enabling technology for that transition. And we're in a good position. I would say, in terms of the DTOR positions, we're very, very optimistic. And again, overall, this is a great opportunity for Applied Materials.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. That was helpful color. And then just quickly jump on Display. In terms of this rebound in order in the fiscal first quarter, how sustainable should we think about this order recovery? And how do you guys view this? Do you view this cautiously or do you think it's the beginning of a big cycle?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, we do think that TV investment is back. As you know, the last couple of years, that our business has been sustained primarily by mobile investments. And the thing is that's happening now for us is that there's a lot of technology change happening. So that as we look to this next phase of investment, our TAM should be about 30% higher than it was in the previous investment cycle, as customers go for metal oxide transistors on the backplane, or they're going to go for LTPS with organic LED displays. So I think this is an area that, after quite an extended downturn, is starting to come back.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: The name is Mehdi Hosseini. I have 2 easy follow-ups. And, Mike, you're exiting fiscal year with $1.6 billion of backlog and talking about double year fee down 5% to 15% in calendar year '13. So unless there is a massive upward revision to this double year fee, even if January quarter bookings are up, I just don't see how your revenues for fiscal year '13 could be up on a year-over-year basis. And simply because the backlog has eroded so much. Do you have any color on that? Then I have a follow-up.
Michael R. Splinter: Well, as we said, if WFE is down, we would expect SSG revenues to follow that, Mehdi. This is the -- well, we're not making a full year revenue projection at this time because our visibility in the second half isn't what we would like it at this time. We do see that we are in, again, the seasonal pattern that we've seen the last few years. We're still in a market where solar is depressed and wafer starts and utilization are not good in semiconductor factories. So we'll see a dip in service in this first quarter. But then we think as utilization improves throughout the year, service should get better. So all in all, unless we see a recovery of the market, we won't grow in 2013.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: But just conceptually, given where the backlog is and where double year fee spending is indicating and SSG down, conceptually, revenues for AMAT could be down on a year-over-year basis.
George S. Davis: It could be if SSG is down. And you're right, we're starting with a very low absolute level of backlog in SSG. One of the things to remember that is different in the foundry-LED world, the turns business that we see in SSG is -- has grown over time. So you can have a quarter where 70% of your orders were booked and shipped within the existing quarter. So I think we really have to see to what extent foundry spends this year relative to last year. The heavier the foundry spending, obviously, the more rapidly you'll see a closing between growth and the backlog. And even within, I think, logic, if PC -- confidence in the PC market goes up, I think, you could see a relatively short term between orders and shipment of tools in that space as well.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And then my follow-up has to do with etch and opportunities for share gain. One of your key competitors last week was talking about 70% of the N+1 decisions made and they're the #1 in the conductor edge. So are you focusing more on an N+2 transition? Or if you think you can grab market share for N+1 next year, how should I reconcile the #1 market leader and their commentary of the share gain with what's you're talking -- what you have mentioned today?
Gary E. Dickerson: Yes, I think we can't comment on what other people are saying. But what we do know is the pull that we have from customers, the penetrations that we're making in the market and the opportunities that we have with all of that from what we see directly from our customers, we think we have a good opportunity to grow our share.
Michael R. Splinter: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: You commented on a number of wafer starts for foundry for 20-nanometer. What's the expectation for 28-nanometer? And I have a follow-up.
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. I think what we believe right now is that we'll finish 2012 pretty close to 200,000 wafer starts per month in 28-nanometer -- that's kind of the combination node. And we'll see 75,000 to 100,000 incremental wafer starts in 2013. That's basically how we're modeling the -- 2013.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: So it's about, maybe on a spend rate, would it be still be like 1/3 of the foundry budget will be on 20-nanometer because of the higher capital intensity?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, I think that's a pretty good assessment of what we're thinking, in that neighborhood. The capital intensity is quite a bit higher at 20.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: So under those parameters, can Applied's foundry SSG business grow?
Michael R. Splinter: Certainly, if we're gaining share and -- the business can grow. We're not making a projection at this point, for the year. And I'm sure your question is really based on a calendar year approach, which we're really not ready to look at the second half of 2013 at this point. But we think we have a strong position in 20, we think we should be seeing those share gains materialize as 20-nanometer really starts to ramp. And then...
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just one quick clarification from George. In terms of the money that you guys freed up by doing the reduction in force and early retirement, you commented that, that scales back in fully by the end of the fiscal year?
George S. Davis: Say that, I'm not sure I understand the question.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: You guys freed up $200 million, right?
George S. Davis: That's correct. That's $200 million '13 versus '12. Right. And so what you'll see is with the redeployment, '13 and '12, from a modeling assumption, you can leave your OpEx pretty flat.
Operator: You next question comes from the line of Tim Diffely with D.A. Davidson.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: I've got a longer-term question here. Based on your comments earlier about the inflection points and increased capital intensity, what's your view kind of longer term, maybe 5 years out, of the WFE market? Does it just bounce around this $30 billion level or does it increase over time?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, I think that depends really on the end market. I don't think we're prepared to make a 5-year forecast on WFE today. Certainly, if the market continues strong, capital intensity is improving, that would tend to make you think that WFE is going to increase modestly over the next few years and there could be a peak in that cycle due to certain investment. But I think it's too early to make a projection that far out.
Gary E. Dickerson: I guess one other thing I would say is that, again, our #1 focus is to grow wafer fab equipment market share. There are a number of inflections that are coming over the next several years. Certainly, 20-nanometer, as we said, is all about the transistor, where we have leadership. Thin fab is also focused on the transistor and a good opportunity to grow our available market and share. 3D NAND, there are multiple film deposition steps that require extreme precision. And that's another area that's a good opportunity for us. And I would say also, longer term, what we're seeing is an increase in changes in device technology around new materials that really leverage our leadership in precision materials engineering and create a great opportunity for Applied Materials.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division: Okay. And then, ultimately, when we get to the 450-millimeter wafers, does that create a bit of a step function down in capital intensity then? Just because of the economies?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, first of all -- the first thing that it will create is a new buildout in 450 because you have to replace all the equipment at some point in the future, depending on a lot of factors, then the capital efficiency will be what it is. But for right now, we're very focused on 300-millimeter share gain. This is the most important thing to our company. It's the most important thing to our customers. They're trying -- these next few generations of technology have very difficult inflection points. We have to make sure we're helping them get the performance and the cost out of their products in these next few generations. And that's where we're spending all of our time focused on.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen Group, Inc.: One for George and one for Gary. George, I wanted to ask about how you think about right-sizing EES? If you just take the new run rate in OpEx, you were guiding to about $30 million a quarter. So that's $120 million a year. And if you assume like a 30% gross margin, you have to do like $500 million in EES just to sort of break even. So I mean, I'm sure that you think that the opportunities are much bigger than that. But why is that the right number? Sort of how do you think about in terms of a megawatt basis or like tops-down. How do you think about how to size the OpEx spend for that business? And then I have one for Gary as well.
George S. Davis: First off, hey, welcome back, Tim, nice to have you on the call. In terms of the right-sizing for solar, this is something, obviously, that we look long and hard at. And we've taken a significant reduction in our costs in that area over the last 2 years accelerating this year. And so the spending that you're seeing there is really for our core leadership positions in a very select set of technologies that we think are going to be the most leveraging to our customers' technology roadmaps going forward. We think it's a growth market that's important. We think it's something that will ultimately differentiate Applied in its ability to grow. And so, I think, at $30 million, we're pretty much where we think we need to be, given our outlook for the market and what we need to sustain our capabilities. Gary, I don't know if you wanted to add anything to that.
Gary E. Dickerson: No, the only other thing I would point out is the $30 million includes both solar and Web. So the solar OpEx number is actually less than that.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen Group, Inc.: Right. Okay, makes sense. And, Gary, just for you, I heard you talk about materials more than I've ever heard. I mean, in 15 years, I've never heard Applied talk about materials that much. And I'm -- and it's interesting, and I'm wondering whether there's some expertise in-house that you're -- that you've come in and you've uncovered? Or whether that's something you have to go out and acquire? Because you've typically worked with the materials suppliers. But it sounds like you think you want to sort of own that expertise a little more.
Gary E. Dickerson: Well, again, if you look at the inflections, as I said before, it really is right in the sweet spot of our leadership in the transistor and materials engineering. So again, 20-nanometer, FinFET, is all about the transistor. And the 3D memory is also a number of new materials where we have leadership. So I think -- and this is over the next several years. If you look at what technologies people will be introducing beyond the next several years, I think this trend towards materials being critical to enable the device performance and customer differentiation is going to increase and create a great opportunity for us. And I'd say it's not just in the semiconductor business, as Mike talked about, and I had in the script earlier in Display, we're seeing an increase in the materials that we will deliver in the Display industry and increase our available market by more than 30%. So I think this trend is one that hasn't happened to Applied in many, many years and creates a great opportunity for us going forward.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Well, thanks, Tim, for your questions, and we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at around 5 p.m. Pacific time today. So thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

Michael Sullivan: Okay and good afternoon. Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Sweeney, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Today we'll discuss the results for our third quarter, which ended on July 29. Our earnings release was issued just after 1 p.m. Pacific Time and you could find a copy on our website, appliedmaterials.com. Also on the website is our quarterly financial highlights presentation, which provides additional details. Mike Splinter will lead off today's call with comments about the industry environment as well as our performance and strategies. George will then discuss our financial performance for the quarter, along with our business outlook. And so with that introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered solid financial performance in line with our outlook despite challenging industry conditions in semiconductor, display and solar. Thanks to strong execution demonstrated by our teams around the world, we posted $2.3 billion of revenue, with earnings near the midpoint of our target range. Strong cash flow performance enabled us to return $615 million to shareholders while maintaining our cash balance. Over the past 3 months, we have made excellent progress with the Varian integration. We are accelerating our compliance to combine the 2 companies, and we are on track to exceed our targeted synergy savings. In June, we announced the appointment of Gary Dickerson as Applied Materials President. I've asked Gary to focus his attention on the company's product strategy and development engine, with a view to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our R&D investments. Gary is fully immersed in this endeavor, and will provide an update at our next call in November. As we outlined at SEMICON West, demand for wafer fabrication equipment has softened dramatically since the first half of the year, with sharp declines in foundry and NAND investment. As we look to our fiscal Q4, we see a combination of macroeconomic and industry dynamics contributing to a very weak business environment. We believe this pullback in demand is seasonal, and we expect it to be short-lived, with orders and revenue recovering in our first fiscal quarter. During this period, we will diligently manage discretionary spending, while focusing our investments on critical programs that support our strategic priorities to grow share in wafer fab equipment and expand our total available market. From European austerity to slowing growth in China and the U.S., economic uncertainty is weighing on top of a seasonal pullback to produce weaker near-term demand. And our customers are choosing to delay their investments until they see stronger demand signals. China is now the largest market for TVs, PCs and smartphones, and the Chinese economy will play a pivotal role in determining how quickly industry investment levels recover. While mobility remains the most significant driver of growth in the semiconductor industry, this is also causing changes in market dynamics. For the second year in a row, we are feeling the effects of more pronounced seasonal buying, as consumers wait for new smartphone and tablet models to be released. With foundries representing about 45% of wafer fab equipment spending in 2012, the investment patterns of these customers are the single most important factor impacting our business today. In addition, lower-than-expected PC sales have held back DRAM bit growth to the 30% range and consequently, investments in new capacity remain at extremely at low levels. The adoption of solid-state drives is not ramping as quickly as forecast and with only modest increase in the bits per box for mobile devices, we now see NAND bit growth in the range of 60% to 65%. As a result, customers have announced they will cut production by roughly 150,000 wafer starts per month on top of reduction in their capital spending. Looking at the industry as a whole, we are maintaining the 2012 wafer fab equipment forecast that we shared at SEMICON. We believe spending will be in the range of $30 billion to $33 billion for the year, and there is a firm foundation for the multiyear capital investment cycle to continue. As the mobility trend gathers pace, we believe foundries will need between 100,000 and 150,000 wafer starts per month of additional 28-nanometer capacity next year. In addition, ultrabooks and Windows 8 have the potential to spur PC growth and drive resurgence in demand for both DRAM and flash memory. Within this investment cycle, the spending mix favors Applied's leadership areas as customers introduce increasingly complex transistors schemes. We expect 2012 to be a record year for our Epi business, driven by an increasing number of selected Epi applications. Our metal deposition group also delivered another strong quarter, benefiting from broader adoption of metal gate transistors. With the 450-millimeter road map becoming clearer and timing of major milestones more predictable, we continue to ramp our development program to be in the right position at the right time to serve our customers through this transition. In Display, mobility-related markets represented 100% of our orders this quarter. We expect investment in these markets to remain at healthy levels as customers shift production of displays and touch panels for both smartphones and tablets to larger substrate sizes and more advanced technologies. In contrast, TV sales for the first half of the year were around 90 million units, which is below the level needed to stimulate capacity additions. In the near term, TV-related investment will be limited to development tools for new technology, focused on metal oxide transistors and organic LEDs. As macroeconomic conditions improve, we believe that TV supply and demand can rebalance quickly, and this will provide a catalyst for customers to resume their plans to populate new factories in China. We expect to see the first orders for these factories before the end of the calendar year. In solar, end-market demand is still robust and we maintain our view that global installations will be in the range of 27 to 35 gigawatts for the year. The industry is relentlessly driving down manufacturing costs and making conversion efficiency improvements. As a result, TV-generated electricity is reaching parity with retail electricity rates in many areas of the world. At the same time, overcapacity within the supply chain has created an exceptionally challenging environment for wafer, cell and module manufacturers. Our EES results reflect an environment of extremely cautious investment by our customers as they focus on conserving cash. Industry consolidation is occurring, albeit slower than anticipated, and this rationalization of capacity will be a critical factor in determining when the supply and demand come back into balance. We remain focused on lowering our cost structure in EES, and have made significant progress shifting our manufacturing footprint to Asia while exiting LED. In summary, we are currently navigating a period of turbulence in our markets and managing a rapidly changing demand profile in our semiconductor equipment business. We delivered solid results for the third quarter, and we're operating the company efficiently with disciplined spending, aligned to the contours of this business environment. Although we see a weak near-term outlook, we firmly believe that the fundamental trends in mobility and solar energy adoption provide a strong platform for Applied Materials to generate long-term value and attractive returns for our shareholders. Now let me hand the call over to George for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?
George S. Davis: Thank you, Mike. And let me add my welcome to everyone on the call today. In our third fiscal quarter, Applied generated strong operating cash flow and ramped the return of cash to shareholders, buying back 3.6% of shares outstanding in the quarter. In a difficult environment, we are controlling spending while ensuring we prioritize investment in key areas to support future growth. Let me start by comparing our third quarter results to the prior quarter. Orders declined 35% to $1.8 billion, reflecting push-outs in semiconductor equipment, lower AGS orders due to the absence of a finFET thin-film solar order and continuing weak demand in our non-semiconductor business. Net sales decreased 8% to $2.3 billion due to lower semiconductor equipment sales. Non-GAAP gross margin was down slightly to 41.6%, primarily due to the impact of lower volumes. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $543 million, 6% below our Q2 levels and 4% below our outlook of $565 million plus or minus $10 million. Adjusting for onetime beneficial items, our run rate was approximately $560 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect to lower our target run rate to $545 million plus or minus $10 million, as we continue to tightly manage discretionary spending while selectively increasing our investment for critical programs in SSG. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27% and for the fiscal year, the rate expectation remains at 26% to 27%. The modest uptick in the rate reflected the impact of lower revenue on our global tax structure. Cash and investments ended the quarter approximately flat at $3.2 billion, as our operating cash flow offset total cash return to shareholders and CapEx. Our strong cash flow performance was due to effective working capital management, with improved inventory and receivable balances offsetting the impact of lower revenues. Our capital allocation priorities for cash continue to be investing in attractive opportunities in our businesses, increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business and utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash. We increased share buybacks to $500 million in the quarter, repurchasing 46.7 million shares at an average price of $10.71 per share. We also paid $115 million in dividends, reflecting the 13% increase that we announced in March. Over the past 4 quarters, we have repurchased approximately 97 million shares or more than 7% of shares outstanding at an average price of $11.08. We expect to continue to be an active buyer of our stock in this environment. Next I will comment on our segment results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were down 41% to $1.2 billion, led by foundry customers. For our fiscal year, we expect SSG orders will be weighted 60% to 65% in the first half, with nearly 70% of foundry orders in the first half of our fiscal year. Net sales decreased 13% to $1.5 billion, consistent with our outlook at the SEMICON West briefing. The largest sequential declines were from foundry and NAND at 17% and 18%, respectively. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin was 31.2%, in line with model performance. In AGS, orders were $531 million. Excluding a thin-film solar line booked in fiscal Q2, orders declined 4% sequentially. AGS net sales were up 5% to $579 million, as strengths in spares and services offset weakness in 200-millimeter equipment demand. AGS achieved model performance, with non-GAAP operating margin increasing to 23.3%. In Display, orders decreased to $67 million, as LCD equipment spending continue to push out. This is the fourth consecutive quarter with orders below $100 million, reflecting exceptionally low demand for television manufacturing equipment. Net sales for Display were up 6% to $142 million, with mobility investments for touch panel and high-resolution screens accounting for the majority of revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 8.5%. In EES, orders decreased to $35 million, reflecting low solar equipment demand as capacity continues to be absorbed. Net sales were approximately flat at $77 million, with solar sales largely reflecting deferred revenue. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $64 million, which included an inventory charge of $26 million. Next I will talk about our expectations for the fourth quarter. As Mike indicated, we are seeing strong seasonal effects in our wafer fab equipment business, along with macroeconomic uncertainties that are leading our customers to reduce spending until they see signs of stronger consumer demand over the next few months. Accordingly, absent further weakening in the global economy, we expect the company's orders and revenues to bottom in our fiscal Q4. Turning to our business segments, we expect SSG net sales to be down 45% to 55% in Q4, marking the low point of our business for the year. We are seeing a strong pullback across all categories of semiconductor equipment customers, and this is the primary factor in the near-term reduction in earnings for the company. In AGS, we expect net sales to be up 5% to 15%, including more than $75 million in revenue from a thin-film solar line. In Display, we believe net sales will be down 25% to 40%, as the TV capacity ramp in China is pushed out for at least an additional quarter. Despite the low level of revenue, we expect Display to remain profitable in the quarter. In EES, we expect net sales to be down 10% to 30%, as the timing of the solar equipment recovery remains uncertain. We expect our overall net sales to be down 25% to 40%, and our non-GAAP earnings to be between $0 and $0.06 per share. Now, Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, George. [Operator Instructions] Jay, let's begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess first question, in terms of calling a trough here in October and looking for a recovery in calendar Q4, I guess can you talk about what you're seeing, what conversations you're having with customers? And I guess what gives you the confidence that they were in this seasonal pause and that we will see a recovery? And as part of that, where do you expect to see customer spending come back strongest?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, thanks, C.J. As we look at what's happening in our Q4 and a drop-off in our discussions with customers, this is pretty much the seasonal low. We're also obviously discussing what's ahead, so our capacity is ready for them in the next month ahead. So we're quite certain that this is on the bottom from those discussions. But I would also add that we still view the 28-nanometer build-out for capacity in 2013. We still need between 100,000 and 150,000 wafers or so to fuel the growth in smartphones and tablets, as well as the build-out of the LTE infrastructure. And then we also think in 2013, we're going to see investments of about 50,000 wafers of 28 nanometers. That will come a little bit later in the year. But I think when we look at last year's pattern, this year's pattern, this year's more accentuated, but really quite similar in this seasonal cycle. I think my big caveat on that is what's going to happen macroeconomically. But macroeconomics are kind of pushing everybody down not only in the foundry sector, but in the other sectors as well. But we really think foundry is going to lead the way out of this in the calendar -- late in the calendar fourth quarter.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then I guess as a quick follow-up, in terms of the product strategy and you talked about providing an update on your November call, I guess what should we expect to hear at that point in time? Are we going to hear primarily on the product side and where you're going to refocus R&D efforts? Or as part of that, will you be talking about optimization of your product portfolio, cost rationalization? What kind of color do you think we’ll hear at that point?
Michael R. Splinter: I think we're going through a lot of detail right now on each one of the products and looking at high-value problems that they're solving and the return on those products. As you know, we really try to look at this on a product -- the return on a product-by-product basis and judge where we should invest. So we'll be ready to talk about that in November, but I think the starting point is the product-by-product analysis.
Operator: Next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So a question on the WFE, Mike. You didn't change the WFE, even though you provide a pretty weak outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. Is that just a calendar versus fiscal thing? And then regarding recovery, I think on an answer in prior discussions, you said that mostly will come from foundry. What do you think will happen on the memory side?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. Thanks, Edwin. Yes, what we're looking at is really calendar versus fiscal here. The timing of our particular fourth quarter gets us into this air pocket. But we're expecting that foundries will lead the way out, and we will see the overall WFE in the range that we had talked about earlier. When you look at it -- if you said, "What's going to happen to drive it to the top end or the bottom end?" We would have to, to get to the top end it would have to be all about foundries pushing harder for capacity in the last few months of the year. And the downside is both NAND, I think, and foundry even pulling back a little bit more than we currently anticipate. But -- so in large part, it's a foundry story for the last part of the year.
George S. Davis: Edwin, it's George. One of the reasons why we're not changing it, when we updated at SEMICON, we talked a lot about the uncertainty in foundry and the outlook that we have seen, which was a strong pullback in foundry. So when we lowered it, we already have the foundry action pretty much in our thinking. I would say the one thing that is marginally worse than we expected at SEMICON has really been NAND push-outs have been stronger and deeper than we anticipated.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. That's was helpful. And then, George, a question on R&D expense. I think on your prepared remarks, OpEx was down again in the October quarter because of the cost reduction. But I think you guys are also starting the investment in 450. Do you see that as the bench that you would drive your R&D to go back up in the coming quarters?
George S. Davis: Yes. I think what you've seen is if you kind of compare year-over-year, that's probably the easiest way to think about it. We've had -- the biggest drivers of increases in our OpEx is number one, we didn't have Varian last year at this time. So we've got the Varian spend and then you’ve got 450. And what you're seeing there though is a reduction in OpEx from a variety of discretionary activities which quite frankly, we also had some of those in Q4 last year, because that was the down quarter for last year. But if you look at our non-semi businesses, they're down between 17% and 20% in their OpEx year-over-year. And that's helping us be able to kind of manage some of the fluctuation and also it's part of obviously the restructuring program that we have going on in EES as well.
Operator: Next question on the line is from Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This question is related to the solar business. It looks like solar revenues were roughly flat sequentially. However, the operating income loss was steeper. I know part of that sounds like it may have been from an inventory charge. Just wanted to understand what other trends you're seeing in solar profitability there that caused this deeper income loss.
George S. Davis: Terence, your analysis is right on. It's -- the difference is the inventory charges taken. And we've been running with some degree of inventory write-downs as we've been going on. And that -- if you look at the underlying operating impact of that business, it will be about $0.06 for the year, and then the inventory adds another, say $0.04 to that picture. Gives you about $0.10 for the year. But that's for the quarter, your analysis is spot on.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, terrific. And then as my follow-up, it sounds like since SEMICON West, where you were expecting foundry spending to be down about 30% in second half, it seems like things have slipped a little bit more since you're now thinking that it's going to be a little bit of a steeper decline. Can you just help us understand how you're thinking has developed since SEMICON West with regard to foundry spending? Have things weakened even further from what you had seen in the later months of June? And also is it broadening out to other customers, or is it just deeper cuts at the top foundries?
George S. Davis: Yes. I would say again, I think directionally, foundry is where we thought it would be. We gave it a range, we said foundry would have about a $0.15 to $0.20 impact on the year. I would say we're probably more at the $0.20 end of the range as we look at what actually came out. But it was within kind of our view of what could happen. Again, I would go back to the fact that NAND has been a little bit weaker in the second half. That's been a factor that's certainly impacting us in this quarter. But also as Mike said, the macroeconomic effect is if you look at DRAM customers we think could be down, this is on a revenue basis, close to 35% to 40% in the quarter as well. Logic will be down probably 20% to 25% quarter-over-quarter as well. Obviously the big hitter is foundry and NAND, but even the other customers are down in the quarter.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Crédit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just wanted to go back to this point about how the year has changed. 3 to 6 months ago, we called the number for WFE, which is still the same number that most people think. 3 to 6 months ago, we thought that shipments would be sort of flat for the start of the second half. I mean is it just the fiscal versus the calendar year for AMAT? You need to see a very, very sharp pickup in your January quarter for making the WFE numbers remain consistent with what the chip companies are saying? Or perhaps we have some downside to WFE? So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about perhaps the magnitude of the pickup that you're expecting to see in January.
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. Thanks, Satya, for the question. The euro has changed kind of pretty dramatically. I think from our standpoint, we thought that wafer fab equipment was going to be closer to flat year-over-year, and now we're in the kind of down 10% to 20% range. And so that's a pretty big impact over the last few months. We really -- I think our supposition earlier in the year was that foundries needed to power through the seasonal curve that we saw last year because of the shortage of capacity, and that's clearly not the case. They added a lot of capacity in Q2 and are now more in the put-it-in production and produce phase of adding capacity. As far as chip companies' projections on their overall capital spending, I think there's 2 factors: one, it may be at somewhat at a lower range of what they projected; and two, then there's the mix of what they're spending, their CapEx on how much is really on wafer fab equipment versus buildings and other equipment. So I think that's one of those factors that we know is going on because some of our customers need more space and capacity to add the next phase of capacity.
George S. Davis: Satya, I would also observe that our non-semi businesses, if you go back to the beginning of the year to where the year has played out, that turned out to be weaker in general that we had anticipated at the start of the year.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes, understood. My question is more on semi, but the answer was useful. A follow-up question for, I guess, Mike. On the Display business, if you just look, take us back, look at 10-year trends in the industry, and it's clearly benefited the last 10 years with LCD TVs have become a bigger part of the mix. More people bought TVs and the size of the TVs increased. As you look at those sort of fundamental drivers over the next 10 years, has something structurally changed relative to area of demand growth? And as you look at that, I mean, how do you think about sizing the Display business over the next 10 years?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. I think the drivers for the Display business that -- I don't know that I can talk about 10 years, but kind of 5 years, number one, is still build-out in emerging markets. TV -- flat panel TV penetration still has a long way to go. We've been disappointed with the demand in China. But I think that is coincident with kind of a slowdown of the economy there. So I think as maybe stimulus comes back there and the economy improves, we're going to see a significant build-out. Then there's the change in technology that we're seeing that -- moving to OLED, moving to metal oxide, these experience-oriented elements, we believe, are going to shorten the replacement time for TVs coming up, certainly over the next 5 years. And then the final element is we still believe that smart TV or potentially Apple TV, if it's a disruptive factor, can spur a replacement demand for TVs. So we still think there are elements out there in the market that are going to push demand even though today, flat-panel TV is the -- we've moved from the flat-panel TV build-out era, if you will, where every 1.5 years we change the size of the glass to now we're really looking at viewer experience, working with the customers on how to improve the technology to deliver that.
Operator: Next we have a question from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First question. You talked about a product review on the next call. Is it fair to assume or safe to assume that everything is on the table relative to that product review, including exiting product lines or exiting business segments to the extent they don't need the high-value solution approach criteria?
Michael R. Splinter: No. I would say, Jim, we've had a history of looking at our businesses and product lines that don't meet our investments hurdle, and I don't think that's changed. We're going to look at every one of our products and make sure that they're really solving high-value problems for our customers and they have significant enough differentiation to be sustainable in the future. But everything, certainly in our portfolio reviews, everything is on the table.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Terrific. And then for my follow-up, not just Applied Materials but most of the semicon companies now are referring to the seasonality in the business or a seasonal decline on top of the macro issues. And the discussion around seasonality in semi equipment is something pretty new, I think, relative to the last 10 or 15 years. It used to be the customers just kind of had to order relatively far in advance. Is this -- is the discussion of a seasonality emerging in the equipment business a function of shorter lead times? Or is it a function of just business kind of what happened last year, so everybody kind of running the playbook back for this year? Or are there other dynamics at work?
Michael R. Splinter: I think shorter lead times are necessary for this seasonality to be in play. But the primary driver of this seasonality is the introduction time of new models, so smartphones and tablets and the buying pattern of consumers. And then our customers are backing up from that when they need to have those parts in production to the dates they need equipment. And because those are pretty consistent, I think, among most of the process equipment companies, you can see these kind of seasonal peaks. And I would say that we've mapped this out. Actually, you can see it for 3 years, at least maybe you can see it for longer. But in the last 3 years, each year the peak has been getting higher in and around our Q2 time period. So that's kind of how we're looking at. It takes more than one factor here to produce this. But you're right, part of it is supply-chain compression.
Operator: Next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I wanted to just follow up on some of the comments you made earlier about weakness in foundry and memory. I was wondering if you can comment on the logic segment. Have you seen any incremental change there since the last time you provided guidance?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, we would say that -- as George just mentioned, logic is down in Q4. But what we would say about the overall segment is we would -- 2012 has pretty much played out as we thought it would. We think 2013 will still be an up year for logic spending, as the major player there moves to the next generation of technology where we're certainly seeing many more process steps moving to the next node. So I think there's no real fundamental changes in logic other than the macroeconomic effects.
George S. Davis: I agree that's -- yes, Vishal, I would also add that I think you certainly see a more moderate pattern and more -- you don't see quite the level of seasonality in the logic side. And I would say in the fourth quarter, it may be one of the few positive order areas for the company as well.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's very helpful. And just one other follow-up. On the memory segment, I know you mentioned that logic and foundry segment will be up next year, will be strong. What do you think about the memory segment? Do you see a similar trend there? I mean, 2012 has been somewhat disappointing. Do you see a recovery in NAND? And is it going to be more front-half loaded or back half loaded?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. Memory is really still largely tied to the success of PCs. So if we see more strength in the PC business next year, that could provide increase in capacity. But in flash, flash factories are under loaded today. I think we've seen cap -- investment pullback fairly significantly. We're kind of down to $1 billion a quarter in both DRAM and NAND investments per quarter. I don't -- I would not predict that we're going to see an early change in that vector. Maybe later in the year as we see more momentum. We would expect more mobile DRAM and some increase in bits per box on the mobile devices. But that's just not enough to provide greater than, let's say, 70% bit growth in NAND that we kind of need to see increased investment and greater than 50% -- 40% to 50% in DRAM to get that kind of investment growth.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Mike and George, I was just curious if your view on 2013 WFE has changed in SEMICON West. It sounds like you're seeing increased seasonality and it sounds like a similar trend is forming in 2013 with 65% in the first half, Mike.
Michael R. Splinter: Well, we certainly think that this seasonality trend will continue into 2013. We can already get views from customers on how they want us to position our capacity and orders throughout the year. I would say it's too early to make any specific claims on 2013, other than we do think that again, it will be above $30 billion of overall investment. So that's still a pretty strong investment as we see the continued build-out of smartphones, tablets, increased investment in logic. And we're quite hopeful that there will be a bounce in PCs with ultrabooks getting more cost effective and Windows 8 really coming into large-scale production.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then my follow-up question is on the solar business profitability. We're starting to see some financial troubles at some of your solar equipment competitors, especially in solar cells, who have a few customers in India. Is this the trend you think that can help Applied maybe get to break even in solar sooner?
George S. Davis: So we're certainly seeing competitive -- many of our competitors that don't have the kind of balance sheets that one would like to have to weather the kind of market environment we're seeing, certainly it's a little deeper and longer than we had anticipated. So we're taking actions to lower our cost structure in the face of that. But there are some companies where the ability to weather this time period is a real question. And ultimately, that should be helpful coming out of this.
Operator: Next question comes from Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I had a question related to your guidance for the third calendar quarter versus your peers. Obviously you're guiding down a little more than some of your U.S peers. And I just wanted to get a feel for how much of this is potentially due to revenue recognition policy, lead times and things like that versus -- just to kind of get a feel for why you're seeing such a bigger drop-off.
George S. Davis: Yes. My sense is when we break these things down, particularly when you see downdrafts like this, it's virtually always a function of rev rec or and shipment recognition.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then the second question was tied to the solar business. Although you have a longer positive look for this area, it's pretty weak right now. And I wasn't sure if you think there's some need to bring the breakeven level down even further than you had previously expected.
George S. Davis: Well, we're working hard on the program that we announced. We just took the first restructuring charges this quarter. So -- and we've got a lot of work to do. We'll continue to look at it. And if we need to take additional action, we will. But we've got a lot to do right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Mike, do you see any significant difference among foundries in Korea -- I'm sorry Korea, Taiwan and U.S.? And as a follow-up, it seems like the Varian semi booking contribution declined less compared to the rest of the SSG. Should we assume the Varian semi to see a steeper recovery in bookings by the January, April quarter?
Michael R. Splinter: First, I think the real difference between -- differences between the foundries is their -- part of their business that's dependent on smartphones and tablets, mobile devices, I think that's the biggest factor. And whether that divides out by Korea and Taiwan versus U.S., it may. But I think there is somewhat different. But the rest of the foundries can't make up the difference for the 2 biggest foundries major seasonality that we're seeing. On Varian, actually if you look inside our businesses, the products that are aimed in and around the transistor are doing better than those that are more mature processes. So I think that's kind of a general statement that we're to look where we have real strength even in the bottom of this cycle. So I think when you look at some of the CVDs, some of the metal depositions in and around the transistor where things are changing very, very rapidly, people have moved high-k, then to High-k/Metal Gate, metal gate last, and now to finFETs, we're going to be seeing rapid changes here. So customers have to invest in those areas that are really making the transistor. And of course that includes the implant, Mehdi, to your point.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: My first question is either, Mike or George, if you look at your sales guidance for SSG for October, this level of sales last seen was sometime in '08-'09 time frame. But you also added Semitool and Varian to it, but the numbers are still low. So I'm just trying to get a sense of, is there something more bigger like market share loss? Or is it more a function of seasonality? And if it's seasonality, is this the magnitude of depth we should get used to going ahead? And then I had a follow-up, too.
George S. Davis: Sure. I think if you adjust for Varian, you'd have to look back probably closer to Q4 '09 to see this kind of quarter. And I would say what you're seeing is hyper-seasonality this quarter where you've got not only kind of the typical pattern that we've been talking about. But you can see, if you look from the peak to the bottom, you've gone almost 11 -- we had about 33% of our SSG quarter was in our Q2. 14% of our full year will be in our Q4. So you've got a major delta between the high and the low. And I think that's really seasonality. In fact in the first half of the year, I mean there's a lot of observation about how we were outpacing the rest of the industry. So you're really seeing more timing and seasonality. And for this kind of move, share is not a factor.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: All right. And then a follow-up. When I look at the big picture of you, last year NAND CapEx actually exceeded DRAM spending, but the NAND market size is still smaller than DRAM. So I was just wondering that from your view, when do you think the NAND as a market will get bigger than DRAM?
Michael R. Splinter: I think that's really totally dependent on solid-state drives. And this has been something that we've been expecting to take off for some period of time, it hasn't taken off. I think our next hope is that solid-state drives will take off in ultrabooks. We've been quite disappointed that tablets and smartphones haven't accelerated the use of flash capacity. It's been -- really DRAM per box has been very, very modestly increasing. Right now, our estimates are that the NAND business is $26 billion, $27 billion. DRAM is $28 billion to $30 billion. So they're pretty close right now. So if one of them had a surge, it would pass -- of growth, it would pass the other. So it could happen even next year.
Operator: Next we have a question from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicholas.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Mike, I think obviously with the marketplace and the uncertainty there, 28 demand -- 28-nanometer demand continues to be strong. With some of the foundry pushouts that you've seen, what's the issue that's probably driving it? Is it more just the digestion period timing of that? Is it yield? Or is it some concerns on the macro front even though the demand for those products appear to be strong?
Michael R. Splinter: I believe that it's primarily digestion and where they have to meet their peak demand, they have to have product and they have to have these products in production to meet their peak demand over these next 3 months to be prepared for holiday selling season. So I believe that's primarily it. There are some facility issues we know that have pushed out some of the equipment demand. I think the only thing that would slow down a recovery or a bounce back where they're putting on capacity, again getting ready for next year is a macroeconomic slowdown that's more pronounced than what we have today. We have to remember if we look back to the first part of -- first half of 2012, foundries were short of capacity. It has spurred a lot of talk about customer owned capacity and the like. I don't think that the foundries want to get into that situation again, if they can avoid it. So we're confident that we're going to see a step-up of buying near the end of the year and into next year.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Right. Just my follow-up question in terms of the cost structure -- I mean the restructuring and the cost savings efforts that you guys have put in place. Obviously you're putting also a lot more effort into the product development side, particularly with the opportunity for 20 nanometers. How are you rationalizing, I guess, the targets that you previously stated versus probably the need to increase or better maximize the investments needed for next-generation nodes?
George S. Davis: By targets, I'm assuming you're talking about the models that we have for...
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Exactly, yes.
George S. Davis: Well, as you know, we took the models down in recognition of the fact that we have this additional spending already. We'll certainly -- we're looking wherever we can at places where we can further reduce costs so that we can expand the spending further on critical programs without moving away from the existing business models. And that's our plan for the time being.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: And basically I just want to be clear, so you got levers that can move around to keep things in line?
George S. Davis: Yes, because we're -- as we've already talked about, you've already seen a shift of spending towards SSG and away from some of our non-semi businesses as we restructure -- particularly as we restructure our EES segment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vasanth Mohan with Piper Jaffray.
Vasanth N. Mohan - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: This is Vasanth calling for Jagadish Iyer. I have a question regarding the Display. Based on your revenue guidance, it looks like we might be looking at a new bottom end revenue for Display. Can you give us an idea of what the environment is like? Do you expect a surge in the January quarter? And you also mentioned that you would still be profitable despite hitting a new low. Can you give us more color on that?
George S. Davis: Certainly, it's -- I wouldn't describe it as a new low. We had a period during the '09 where we were lower. But certainly if you look through normal operating conditions, the midpoint of the guidance would be slightly below the lowest previous quarter in there. And again, I think it's a reflection of how that organization runs and how we've been able to basically invest in the new products that they've needed. They've done a great job in taking share in these new mobility markets, while at the same time, as we said, taking down their operating spending. So they're very focused on being breakeven in a difficult environment, and that's currently what we see.
Vasanth N. Mohan - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And as a follow-up, is the weakness related -- has anything to do with the problems that companies are having with the OLEDs?
George S. Davis: No. This is really about basic television infrastructure build-out, primarily in China and the timing of that, which has been impacted by the macroeconomic conditions, and also the largest market for televisions now is China. And China has been much softer than expected as people set their plans. I think a number of our customers felt they'd be ramping up capacity in China at the back end of this year, and now it looks like that will be sometime in '13.
Operator: And our final question today will come from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Just one quick question. George, I think you mentioned that you expect silicon order to be 60% to 65% front-end loaded for this fiscal year. Should I take that number, I think 60%, I get to around $1 billion of orders in the fourth quarter? So with lower orders eventually, what gives you confident that business will rebound beyond the October quarter?
George S. Davis: Say that again, now?
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, sorry...
George S. Davis: You're talking about confidence that Q1 will rebound if we have a very low order quarter in Q4, is that the question?
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes. Yes, you got it.
George S. Davis: Again, it gets back to the comments Mike made earlier, which is foundry is going to have to come back. And as you know, when foundries are ordering, we typically go to almost a turns business, where in the first half of the year, many of the orders were earning about 70% in the quarter, booked and shipped in the quarter. So you can't always -- you can't always see the -- or use the prior quarter as predictive as we used to be able to do in the good old days.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Edwin. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

We hope to see many of you at the event and we'll also provide a webcast and replay for anyone who won't be able to join us in person. So with that introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered another quarter of solid financial results, posting $2.5 billion of revenue and earnings at the high-end of our target range. These results reflect strength in our semiconductor equipment business, driven by robust foundry spending. Investments in areas related to advanced transistors are particularly strong, enabling our front-end products and implant groups to achieve record quarterly sales. In contrast, the environment for our Display and Solar businesses remains weak, as television sales continue to be sluggish and solar market adjusts to excess manufacturing capacity. We recently announced the details of our EES restructuring plan. The actions we are taking are consistent with our previously stated goal to reduce the annual breakeven level for EES to approximately $500 million. Our success in driving operational improvements across the company has bolstered our confidence in our ability to deliver strong cash flow performance throughout our business cycles. As a result, in March we announced the 13% increase in our quarterly dividend and a new stock repurchase program authorizing up to $3 billion of buybacks in the next 3 years. Let me now turn to the economic outlook. While a number of indicators point towards stronger growth of our global economy in the second half of the year, we remain mindful of the consumer spending implications resulting from macroeconomic risks in Europe and the emerging markets. Mobility is the prominent macro theme impacting Applied's business as it drives significant changes in consumer behavior, including faster adoption rates for new products and shorter refresh cycles. Global appetite for mobile devices with new features, longer battery life and brighter, higher resolution displays continues to strengthen. We now see smartphone sales in the range of 660 million to 710 million units for the calendar year and maintain our view that tablets will grow approximately 60% year-on-year to more than 100 million units. As these devices drive demand for leading-edge foundry capacity, the market leaders are aggressively accelerating their ramps at advanced nodes. Foundry investment has contributed almost 60% of our revenue in the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2012. Over the past 2 years, seasonal buying patterns have become more pronounced, as the foundries need capacity and production that supports smartphone model changes later in the year. We see their equipment spending peaking in the second quarter. And despite the uptick in Q2, we believe foundry investment will be maintained in the second half of 2012 and distributed over a broader base of customers. Unit growth of smartphones and tablets is also driving demand for NAND. However, the average content per box remains relatively flat. We believe bit growth will be about 75% for the year, with approximately 1/3 of investment representing new capacity additions and 2/3 technology conversions. This is resulting in softening of spending in the near term. With hard disk drives supply issues now resolved, global PC sales are recovering. DRAM bit growth is in the 30% to 40% range and process equipment investment remains at historic lows. However, we believe ultrabooks and Windows 8 will have a positive impact on logic and memory spending starting in late 2012. Across the industry, factory utilization rates and wafer starts are steadily increasing, and this is reflected in revenue growth for our services business. As a result of sustained investment by the foundries, we are narrowing our wafer fab equipment forecast. We currently see spending in the range of $32 billion to $35 billion or flat to down 10% compared to 2011, with a relatively even split between the first half and second half of the year. A favorable spending mix also contributes to our positive outlook for fiscal 2012. As foundries introduce advanced transistors schemes at 28-nanometer node, the number of selected epitaxy and ion implantation steps is growing. Applied's market leadership in epi and implant resulted in record quarterly revenues for these businesses. Our metal depositions group also posted its highest quarterly sales in more than a decade, reflecting the increased complexity in PVD for metal gate structures. We expect continued strength from these product lines as transistor formation becomes more process-intensive at the 20-nanometer node. The Varian integration is progressing to plan. We are pleased with our customers' response to the acquisition. We are on track to exceed our target synergy savings. As we integrate the 2 companies, we're deploying several members of the Varian management team to roles in other business units and functions. In Display, near-term orders are being supported by mobility applications, as high-resolution mobile displays migrate from smartphones to tablets and as touch panel manufacturers add capacity in anticipation of touch-enabled Ultrabooks. While investment in TV capacity remains at low levels, we see a number of indications that the market is improving. With panel prices increasing and factory utilization trending higher, and as customers start to build out new factories in China, we expect TV-related orders to pick up as early as the fourth quarter. In addition, the adoption of metal oxide transistors is accelerating. This technology increases the served available market for Applied's deposition equipment by about approximately 30%. And we expect this to have a positive impact on revenues in 2013. In solar, our view of the end market has not changed materially since March. Germany remains the leading consumer of PV and has once again delayed their feed-in tariff reduction. Demand in China, the U.S. and Japan is also accelerating. Marginal efficiencies are steadily rising. And as manufacturing cost continue to fall, we are starting to see the economics of solar working even in non-incentive markets. Investment in new capacity remains at extremely low levels, despite the top panel makers in China, and Taiwan running their factories at high utilization, and noncompetitive capacity being taken offline. While we remain confident in the long-term potential of the EES business, we are scaling back our development program for LED equipment, consolidating administrative and support functions in our solar business units and moving manufacturing for our wafering products in Asia. These actions will improve profitability across cycles, while still allowing us to invest in the products that are critical enablers for our customers and for long-term growth of the business. In summary, 2012 can be characterized as another strong year of wafer fabrication equipment spending. Applied is delivering the solutions our customers need to meet their aggressive capacity ramps and rapid transition trends to new technology and volume production. Now let me hand the call over to George for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?
George S. Davis: Thank you, Mike, and let me add my welcome to everyone on the call today. During the second fiscal quarter, we exceeded our expectations for revenue and delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 at the high-end of our target range of $0.20 to $0.28 per share. Strong performance in our semiconductor equipment business was the largest contributor to these results. Our Solar and Display businesses continue to focus on next-generation technology, while managing their overall spending in the face of weak markets. As Mike indicated, after the end of the quarter, we announced the restructuring of our EES business to lower the cost structure and the operating breakeven level. We expect to incur charges of $70 million to $100 million for costs relating to employee severance, inventory write-downs and other asset impairments over the next 12 to 18 months. These costs represent approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share on a GAAP basis and up to $0.01 per share on a non-GAAP basis. We will keep you updated as these charges impact our financial statements. I'll now compare our second quarter results to the prior quarter. Orders increased 38% to $2.8 billion and net sales increased 16% to $2.5 billion, led by strong demand for semiconductor equipment. Backlog grew 10% to $2.4 billion, in line with orders. Backlog adjustments were a negative $24 million, as cancellations, financial debookings and foreign exchange impacts of just under $100 million were partially offset by $73 million of re-bookings, primarily in Display. Our backlog aging remains healthy, with over 80% of backlog expected to turn in the next 2 quarters. Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.1%, up 1.4 points sequentially, reflecting a higher mix of SSG revenue. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $580 million, slightly above our target range of $565 million, plus or minus $10 million. We expect to be in line with our target range for the current quarter. Spending on SSG programs continues to increase in line with a rapid acceleration of technology adoption and the early work on 450-millimeter. Overall, we are seeing some benefit of early synergy capture. We expect the impact of further synergies and our broader EES actions to bring operating expenses to the lower end of our target range over the next several quarters. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.9% and for the fiscal year, the rate expectation remains at 26% to 27%. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3.2 billion, up $289 million. Operating cash flow was $603 million or 24% of revenue, driven by higher earnings and a reduction in working capital. Improved inventory and payables more than offset increases in receivables associated with higher net sales. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be investing in attractive opportunities in our core businesses, increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business and utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash. In addition to increasing our dividend and setting a new 3-year repurchase program in the quarter, we paid $104 million in dividends and spent $200 million to purchase 16.2 million shares. At current price levels, we continue -- we expect to continue to be an active buyer of our stock. Next, I will comment on our signal results as compared to the prior quarter. SSG orders were up 39% to $2 billion, reflecting continuing strong foundry demand. Net sales increased 32% to $1.8 billion, above the upper end of our outlook. Customer concentration remained high with the top 3 customers representing 72% of orders and 68% of revenue. SSG's non-GAAP operating margin increased to 32.3% on higher revenue, with improved earnings flow-through more than offsetting spending increases for new programs. In AGS, orders grew 26% to $650 million. Excluding a thin-film solar line booked in the period, orders would have been 7% higher compared to the prior quarter. AGS net sales were up 3% to $551 million, slightly below our outlook due to the timing of some 200-millimeter equipment shipments. Non-GAAP operating margins declined slightly to 20.1%. In Display, orders increased to $84 million, driven by advanced mobile display investments. Net sales for Display were up 29% to $134 million and above our outlook due to earlier-than-anticipated tool sign-offs. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.7%. Display has maintained its spending discipline and will remain profitable in a challenging environment. In EES, orders increased $29 million to $62 million, reflecting very low levels of demand. Net sales declined to $79 million. EES had a non-GAAP operating loss of $57 million on lower revenue and a $20 million inventory charge. Next, I will talk about our expectations for the third quarter. We expect SSG net sales to be down 5% to 10%. This decrease follows a stronger-than-expected second quarter. In AGS, we expect net sales to be flat to up 10%, driven primarily by improving wafer starts. In Display and EES, we believe net sales will be in the range of flat to plus or minus 20%, with both operating from a low base. We expect our overall net sales to be flat to down 10% and we expect our non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.29 per share. This estimate includes a non-GAAP charge of up to $0.01 per share for the EES restructuring actions. For the fiscal year, the company expects net sales and earnings per share to be at the high-end of the company's previous outlook, which estimated net sales in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.5 billion, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.95. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, George. [Operator Instructions] Holly, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar, Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Mike, it sounds like you said that the year is likely to be flattish for WFE and you've taken up, at least, the low end of your WFE outlook. But you also said that Q2 may be a peak for foundries and you think memory is likely to remain weak. Could you just give a sense of the moving parts between first half and second half? What's sort of coming up to make it flat in the second half?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. So I think first of all, to kind of understand our view on this, you have to think about -- what the foundries need to supply model changes and the buying season at the end of the year. So what it does is peaks out foundry spending in this kind of second calendar quarter, end of the first quarter, beginning of the second calendar quarter. Now, since if you look at both our fiscal year in the very beginning of the calendar year, spending in wafer fab equipment was a little bit weak. So as you go through the -- when we add it up, we get pretty much flat first half, second half, even though we see a peak in this time period of March, April, May. Then if you we at the other kind of segments of wafer fab equipment spending, in the DRAM area, we expect low levels of spending throughout the year, modestly down in the second half of the year. NAND spending, we previously had thought it would be better, but we now think it's not going to be better. It's going to be a little bit lower in the second half of the year as well. And then we do expect logic spending to perk up at the very end of the year as new tech -- the next node of logic technology starts to be purchased. So the summation of that is foundry will end up being pretty flat first half, second half; logic will pickup; and memory will be modestly down in the second half.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. One quick follow-up. If I take a step back from the seasonal trends in foundries and all that, if I look at how big this 40-nanometer node is at all the foundries, and if I look at how much capacity is being added at 28 nanometer, and if I sort of try to think about the capacity at the end of the year, relative to how big the opportunity is, do you think that we are labeling the 28-nanometer additions or later links or early links? How do you sort of think about the overall opportunity for 28 additions?
Michael R. Splinter: Our view on 28 is that this is going to be the largest node. We think demand on 28-nanometers is very high and there's still constrained supply. The speed of the ramp is about something in the neighborhood of 50% faster than the 40-nanometer, 45-nanometer ramp. And we think in the end, when this -- when 28-nanometer peaks out over the next few years, it will end up being something on a range of 40% higher than the previous generation peak. So right now, we think 28-nanometer is going to be strong through the year. It's going to be strong into 2013. Assuming that our customers can find a place to put equipment, they'll continue to add equipment as quickly as they can.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Two questions. First in the EES segment, what does normalized profitability have to get to over the next couple of years, post the restructuring in order for you guys to want to stay in the business? That would be the first question. Second question is on the NAND side, obviously it's been a little lower than we all would have thought this year. Is it just pricing that we need to look at in order to determine when that segment could pick back up, or is there some technology transitions coming along that could create a need for increased spending, even in the absence of a pickup in pricing?
George S. Davis: Jim, it's George. I'll the question on the EES segment. I think if you look at the new EES model that we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we showed that operating margins went to somewhere between 16% and 19% when we to get to a $1 billion of revenue, which is about half of the run rate that we saw last year. So we think as EES moves up into that range, it starts to show the underlying benefit of the core operating businesses. It continues to be an investment vehicle for us. We think this is an attractive long-term business and so we'll continue to invest in next-generation cell technologies. But we think in that range, it will be a positive contributor to the company.
Michael R. Splinter: So Jim, I think you got both a question and a follow-up. But the NAND follow-up question, what we're seeing right now is about a 75% bit growth. But within that, there's a number of things, maybe I can address first supply and then demand. On the supply side, we're seeing a number of things happening here. A lot of the legacy demand is kind of falling off for things like cameras, iPods or MP3 players, and USB drives. So that allows them room to upgrade their legacy capacity, so factor one. Then additionally, the 3-bit per cell technology is getting qualified in many more applications and much faster, probably, than we thought it would. On the demand side, I think the biggest factor is that the footprint in tablets and smartphones of NAND flash is not moving up as fast as we thought. So while they're affected by that big growth rate of 60% in tablets and 30-plus percent in smartphones, they're not getting a big additional kicker on the bit growth because the number of bits per box are staying relatively flat. I think that part of that is pricing, but I think part of it is just what consumers demand for storage in these devices. So until solid-state drives get into PCs or the footprint dramatically changes, I think we'll see this kind of growth rate, bit growth, in NAND.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin, UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a question on the 2012 sales guidance being at the higher-end at $9.5 billion. Do you have an updated view on the Silicon group sales guidance for the fiscal year? Can we assume that the Silicon sales will be at the higher end of the range given at Analyst Day?
George S. Davis: Yes, I think the pick up that we're seeing in our outlook is driven by SSG, so that's where we're getting the additional benefit.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And my follow-up question is do you think you could achieve the 24% target market share gain goal at foundry customers faster than you originally thought, given the strength you're seeing there now?
Michael R. Splinter: I don't know about faster than we're thinking. I think we have to see some more transistors move the gate last to be able to see that, and some more gains in our etch and PD -- in our Inspection business to be able to reach that goal. But we're encouraged by the gains in the front end at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria, RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Mike, in perspective of 28-nanometer capacity constraint, can you tell us, are you getting a longer lead time because it seems like that your revenue is going down but your orders are pretty high. Is that the customers are slotting for a longer period of time with you because of the capacity constraints?
Michael R. Splinter: I think that customers have recently realized how constrained the capacity is, so we have a way of doing business and for them to signal as soon as they know where they're going to need capacity. I wouldn't say that they're giving us a lot more lead time. I think they're telling us as soon as they know that they need more capacity. In part, you can see that here in our Q2, where demand was a bit higher in our semiconductor group than we thought it would be. And I think that actually is extending into Q3. So I don't know that we get anymore lead time on this. But we would like to get more lead time but the way this business is working right now, I think customers let us know as soon as they know.
George S. Davis: And with some of our customers, the time between order and shipment is pretty tight. And so we had another quarter of pretty high turns, which also makes it hard to make the math work when you look at the high orders in this quarter and the lower orders, but still very strong demand.
Michael R. Splinter: It is good to see the backlog inch up a bit, though, I will say that.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And one more thing if you can elaborate on the foundry side, I think you said the first half was very concentrated. And did you say that you're seeing some broadening from the foundry -- in terms of foundry customers in the second half?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, I think that's fair to say. But when you really look at this, there are 4 major foundry spenders, and it's really a matter of the mix between those 4 major foundry spenders; who's spending more, who's spending less. I think the second half will be a little bit more even than the first half.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok, Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Actually a question on the Display side. You mentioned on the prepared remarks that you expect fourth quarter to pick up. Just to clarify, is that calendar or fiscal? And in terms of pickup, what is driving that? Is that new model changes or just channel demand?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. So we said by our fourth fiscal quarter, we said as early as our fourth fiscal quarter, but the biggest thing that we continue to see some increase investment in mobility, for tablets and for touch-enabled ultrabooks. But also to really have the orders pick up, we have to see TV investments increase. And that, particularly, will be in some factories in China. The factories are built, and it's a matter of customers deciding when to facilitize those. But we think that could be as early as fourth quarter. There's been pretty significant underinvestment this year, CapEx as low as $3 billion. Our equipment CapEx as low as $3 billion. So very significant underinvestment here. Meanwhile the market is growing, so the shortages are improving, prices are improving. Supply and demand is getting more in balance. So we think that there is needed investment and as we projected in Analyst Day, we think 2013 can kind of get back to 2011 revenue levels for us.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: That was very helpful there. And then going back to silicon, just I guess a question on foundry. I think one of the foundry, or at least one of the foundry or some of the foundries, are starting to talk about 20-nanometer as the new node and I think some people are speculating that will be a bigger node and if you listen to what Intel is talking about in terms of 20-nanometer, it's seeing basically bigger [indiscernible] because you need more equipment. So are you guys anticipating that to start to come in calendar fourth quarter of this year? And do you expect that to be, I guess, a longer-term driver for the foundry business?
Michael R. Splinter: Certainly, we do expect 20-nanometer to again be a very big node for the foundries. We'll see some R&D equipment, but we don't expect a major ramp in 20 nanometers in the fourth quarter. Really, what we expect is logic spending to increase at the end of the year as 14-nanometer capacity starts to get built. Both of those technologies are quite good for Applied as the advanced transistors take a lot more steps. They'll take more epi steps. They will take more metal steps to be able to develop those high-performance low-power transistors.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Blansett, JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Quick question on the second half as you diversify out your customer base in SSG. Should we expect a modest improvement in the margin profile when this occurs?
George S. Davis: It will be -- I think, more impact on the margin will be just the activities we're taking on cost. So it'll be modestly positive, but not material.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Then the follow-up was tied to the disclosure that you're going to significantly reduce your spending on the LED front. Does this mean you're out of the area or are you just trying to kind of minimize the development expenses at this time for maybe a longer burn before you get some product?
Michael R. Splinter: So what we're going to do there is certainly we have a number of customers that we've been working with. We'll continue to support those customers in their efforts to get our products into production. But we're going to pull back on how much we've been spending on the new capabilities and the new products in the MOCVD area. So we will pretty significantly pullback on the spending there. And really, the rationale is we have a lot of areas that we are looking at that have good return for the company and for shareholders and we have to prioritize our spending. And this is one of those areas where the return looked quite far out, so we made our choices to spend in other areas and also cut back and get our profitability in our Solar business up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen Citigroup.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This is Wenge Yang for Terence. In terms of DRAM spending, as the DRAM price stabilize, is there any discussion from the customers to resume some of the technical -- technology shrinks for the DRAM sector?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. Technology shrinks are ongoing. The DRAM guys have had -- primarily, where they're spending their small capital budget is on technology shrinks. But we've been encouraged to see prices stabilize here. I think it's certainly a sign that capacity and demand are getting more in balance there, as we all know there is some capacity coming off line here at the current time, which also should help that balance. But people are not talking about new factories yet at this point, or new big capacity adds.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Just a quick follow-up on that. Last time, when [indiscernible] merging to Micron camp [ph], there was a technology spending to convert the processes from [indiscernible] process to Micron processes. So in this round, if Elpida and Micron deal went through, do you see another round of technology spendings to consolidate the process into a single process backlog?
Michael R. Splinter: I really think it's too early to tell exactly how Elpida and Micron are going to get together. I'd just say we're encouraged that the factories are still running and Elpida is getting orders from major customers. I think those things are positive signs right now. How far down the road, certainly, eventually, they have to synergize the technologies, but that may not be needed for a while because the spec DRAM cells are relatively similar.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Shankar, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Mike or George, one is a long-term question, with all the well-publicized supply-side issues stated by the fabless companies. Do you think down the road, these fabless guys that are well capitalized might start buying front-end tools from consignment and place it at the foundries, kind of like what they do at the back and the tester of the OSAT?
George S. Davis: I think it's a great long-term question. I don't think we would have any visibility to that trend starting now. And again, I think what you're seeing with foundry customers is a desire to add capacity to meet future demand and across a broad group of customers. So I think the model as it stands right now is still on the horizon.
Michael R. Splinter: But certainly people are concerned about not having enough supply at this node. So I think it will be interesting to see what strategic actions they take for the next node of capacity.
George S. Davis: Well, one of the challenges is how do you -- you'd have to be a customer that had tremendous scale. Because factories today are only going to get more scale intensive. So there's probably only 1 or 2 customers, and maybe 3 actually, that have that kind of scale and 2 are already fairly engaged in production.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then just my follow up, along the same path. It seems like the foundry players are spending for yield and demand. So in a scenario of the macro economy deteriorates in the second half, in your view, do you think the foundry players continue to invest for whatever reasons they want to do it in the second half or do you think they'll scale back in the second half of the year?
Michael R. Splinter: I think it really depends on what the demand on smartphones and tablets are. These things seem to transcend some of the economic environment, but it depends on how bad a situation we can imagine. Certainly, if there's a situation like 2008, I think everybody pulls back like they did in 2008. But I think with any kind of modest pullback, there's a good chance that these electronic devices continue to be sold in nearly these kind of quantities that we're talking about.
George S. Davis: And we're starting to PCs pickup, which is a positive sign and certainly we didn't get much help from PCs last year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho, Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Can you go back for a second in terms of just trying to reconcile the revenue outlook that you're presenting for July versus I guess the strong order flow you've seen over the last 2 quarters. You mentioned turns business continues to be high. I guess is that any indicator for us to look at how orders are or what's the discrepancy? How can I reconcile the strong order flow that we've seen versus the revenue guidance for July?
George S. Davis: Well, I mean, I think we discussed the SSG element, which is a high degree of turns business that we saw in the second quarter. Also, remember we had a large, close to $100 million booking in AGS related to a SunFab project and that won't actually revenue until after the third quarter. So that may be part of what, if you're trying to reconcile, that may be part of the math.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And also, a second question in terms of the margin profile on a going forward basis. You mentioned a lot of the gains you hope to get on the margin profile from the cost savings efforts. As revenues begin to grow again to what I would characterize as more normalized levels, how much does just the impact of increasing revenues contribute it to say the gross margin, more particularly?
George S. Davis: Well, I think you're already going to see it. In the third quarter, we said we'd be down on revenue. I think we're going to be fairly flat on gross margin as some of the improvements help offset the effect of volumes. So one of the things in margin that is the big factor is going to be mix. And as we get -- continue to see a strong semi mix, while we're -- particularly while we're seeing the non-semi business is still at absolute levels, we still have some room for upside. But really it's when the non-semi businesses start to recover, which we expect to happen in '13, that I think you're going to see some real lift on the margin side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah, Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: George, I'm just trying to understand the bookings profile that you reported in the second quarter. Some of your competitors reported a much lower bookings number in March quarter. I'm just trying to understand is it just timing, or is it exposure to certain set of customers or lack of exposure in Japan or is it the share gains?
George S. Davis: Yes, I think it's -- I'd love to say it's a little bit of all of it, but the fact is we also had an additional month, which was an important month in terms of demand. It's a month that'll be in our competitors' next quarter and it won't be in ours. But we had very, very strong, particularly foundry orders in the second quarter, and that really was the foundation. In addition, as I said in AGS, we're above trend in orders because we had the one large project order that skews the data a little bit.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then one of your foundry customers recently pulled in 20-nanometer CapEx, are you seeing similar activity at some of your foundry customers? Are they asking you more for 20-nanometer? And do you expect maybe some of those customers to similarly follow the big move?
Michael R. Splinter: I think they have to be -- everybody will move to the next generation of technology as fast as they can because demand is high, next-generation gives smaller die size. But I think there's time yet to get those technologies to really be production-worthy. And so as soon as they can get them into production, they will. Everybody is working on that next-generation of technology at a breakneck pace. So it's just a matter of how soon those breakthroughs come and how good the transistors are and how reliable they are.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse, Barclays Capital.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess with silicon guided down here in July, but you all look for second half to track in line with the first half, curious if your expectations are for a snapback in Q3 or how should we think about the linearity of silicon revenues in the second half?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, I think that we're thinking that, that will happen in later in the calendar year, not probably in the Q3 time frame, as customers are really trying to get that equipment into production status and starting to build chips. So the way we're looking at it is that the pickup will come in the latter part of the calendar year.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And as follow-up, can you, I guess, outline your expectations for OpEx as we move into the second half? I know clearly, if the market moves around things can change. But assuming that this scenario you've laid out towards the various business segments, how should we think about the trends for OpEx?
George S. Davis: Yes, again for Q3, we would expect to be in the range of $565 million, plus or minus $10 million, certainly down from Q2. And then as we see the effects of synergies increasing and also the impact of the EES restructure, we should be able to move down lower in the range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer, Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Two questions, Mike and George. First on the Display side, when do think you could probably see north of the $200 million run rate level if -- Display has been kind of quiet for few quarters. So when do you think it's going to pop up given that touch panel has been one of the hot areas on the ultrabook side. So any color on that?
George S. Davis: I mean, we think you could see orders certainly bounce up to that level as early as our fourth fiscal quarter. But we would expect that run rate to be certainly more prevalent in 2013 than we're seeing here in 2012.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. Second question just a follow-up, the $500 million break even for the EES, a 2-part question: First is what is your conviction that solar equipment spending should come back sometime in '13? And second thing is that do you believe you could be profitable in fiscal '13?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. We think both of those are possible. It's in part why we aimed the target at $500 million, so that we could be profitable in 2013 with our current level of expected revenue. It's, of course, pretty hard to tell right now, but we're encouraged by what's happening on the end market. We think the first quarter was pretty close to 8 gigawatts of deployment. So we'll see what happens the rest of the year and how close client demand get.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pang, Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Two questions. One, have your bit growth expectations changed for NAND or DRAM since the year? And the second question is, in terms of the 20-nanometer front [indiscernible] how would you characterize the growth relative to 28-nanometer?
Michael R. Splinter: I'm sorry, Ben, I didn't quite catch the second question on 28-nanometer versus 20-nanometer. We're you talking about capacity or complexity?
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Basically, your market, your, or I guess, the 10,000 [indiscernible] whatever, how much of a bigger opportunity do you guys have with the [indiscernible] as part of the whole. So I just want to see if it's -- is that your biggest opportunity in SSG going forward?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. Okay, so first on bit growth. Our view on bit growth really hasn't changed much in the last few months. DRAM in the 30% to 40% range, not a lot of momentum there although we see increased footprint on DRAMs and smartphones, which again is another one of those positive signs for DRAMs. And then flash in the 75% bit growth regime. And that's resulting -- and about 1/3 of that results in capacity additions and 2/3 in upgrades -- that they're achieving through upgrades. We think the 20-nanometer technology is going to be between 30% and 40% more complex. Layers that are deposition layers, etch layers, inspections that all could accrue to Applied Materials. So our overall SAM, if you will, should increase by roughly that amount on a per wafer start or per 10,000 wafer start basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller, CLS.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Mike, I just want to -- I'm not sure you covered it, but there was a decision today on solar import tariffs on the Chinese. I'm just wondering how that -- you might think that might affect your EES business?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, the import tariffs for -- the anti-dumping import tariffs were certainly larger than we thought, 30%, more than 30% for many -- as many, many Chinese solar manufacturers. These tariffs are on top of some tariff -- some countervailing duty tariffs already levied, so this seems to be pretty steep. It will certainly cause changes in the supply chain. For those global companies, I think they will be able to adjust their supply chain, move around, get access to cells from other regions. It'll also give opportunity, I think, to Taiwanese manufacturers and of course, it will give some benefit to U.S. manufacturers as these tariffs get levied. For Applied Materials, we're selling to pretty much every solar -- every crystalline silicon solar manufacturer. And our focus with them is on reducing cost and improving efficiency. We certainly -- our goal, and I think the goal of most of our customers is to drive the cost down so that governments don't have to intervene into the business either from incentive or tariff kind of situations. So we're going to keep our focus up in this area. In the end, if it doesn't affect demand, my biggest worry that these tariffs would affect in demand, slowdown in demand, that would be a negative for every part of the solar industry, so hopefully they don't do that. But I think there's a pretty big risk of that.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: And then a quick follow-up for George. How should we think about the gross margins and the tax rate in the second half of the fiscal year?
George S. Davis: Sure. So as we said for the second half of the year, we don't really see a big shift in mix impacting. So I think at the levels that we're seeing today or possibly slightly improved on margin. And the tax rate for the full year, our outlook is still 26% to 27%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg, Pacific Crest.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to comment on the Varian numbers, thanks for breaking those out. That's helpful to see how that business is developing and I'm just wondering if you expect the implant revenue to stay at the current revenue levels through the year or improve? And I'm also wondering if you see an expansion in that market, 14-nanometer logic or 20-nanometer foundry?
George S. Davis: I'll talk about the year and, Mike, maybe you want to talk about the future technology generations. For the year, this is -- the second quarter was just a very, very strong quarter, record quarter for Varian since its inception. So, while I'd like to see every quarter going forward at this level, I think it'll move in line with the rest of the industry. But very, very strong overall.
Michael R. Splinter: Again, we think that making advanced transistors is a very intricate business and implant is going to play an increasingly big role in that. It was part of our thesis from the very beginning of why we were attracted to Varian and the implant business. So we believe that it will be a bigger part of gateless transistors. We think it will be a bigger part of how you dope thin-fed transistors. So we think that this is going to continue to have a growing SAM over the upcoming generations of the technology.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Just to clarify why was Q1 so strong for implant, or Q2, sorry?
Michael R. Splinter: Well really, foundry in both our share at foundries, but because 28-nanometer transistors, you can see all of our transistor businesses rise. Epi gets -- there's more passes of epi. There's more implants to adjust the transistors. There's more metal passes to ensure that the transistor performance, the turn-on voltages are set at the right levels. So these devices are getting more complex. We have great technology and products that are really aimed at exactly -- we've been working for years with customers exactly for this inflection.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria, RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: One question on buyback. It looks like you have been buying back about $15 million, $20 million, around $11. Should we think of that, that is going to be the level, and you will increase or decrease at lower and higher prices in terms of buyback?
George S. Davis: What we've said is historically, we've been pretty ratable when we are buying and we've said with the kind of volatility that we're seeing in the markets today that we're going to be a little bit more opportunistic. And so we won't forecast ahead of the quarter what amount we're going to buy, but we certainly expect to be active buyers at these levels.
Michael Sullivan: And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

The registration site is open now and we hope to see many of you in 6 weeks. And with that introduction, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. On behalf of Applied Materials, I would like to convey our condolences to Steve Appleton's family and our colleagues at Micron. Steve's leadership in the semiconductor industry will be greatly missed. Now let me comment on Applied Materials' performance and our industry outlook. I'm pleased to report that Applied started 2012 with a strong first quarter, posting revenue and earnings that exceeded the high-end of our ranges. Global demand for mobile electronics is driving strong capital investments by semiconductor customers, resulting in solid order momentum and higher expectations for our second quarter. The rate of technical change continues to accelerate in all of our markets and leading-edge technology investment remains a priority for our customers. In early November, we completed our acquisition of Varian, and welcomed their talented team into the Applied Materials family. Bringing these 2 leaders together comes at a critical time as the industry accelerates its advanced transistor roadmap. Our combined capabilities in Epi implant and thermal processing enabled new opportunities to provide customers with high-value solutions for the next generations of high performance energy-efficient transistors. Let me now turn to the economic outlook. Since the start of the year, we have seen improvements in a number of macroeconomic indicators. While the ongoing recession and increased austerity in parts of Europe remain a concern, we believe the global economic environment will support healthy spending by consumers and businesses. I'll now provide an update for each of our segments. In semiconductor, 2012 is shaping up to be the year of the foundry. The mobility trend is driving growth and in the fourth calendar quarter, smartphone unit sales surpassed PCs for the first time. We expect between 600 million and 700 million smartphones to be sold in 2012, an increase of 35% year-on-year. In addition, we believe the tablet market will grow by more than 60% this year on top of 65 million units sold in 2011. Smartphones and tablets are driving demand for application processors and as these processors become increasingly sophisticated, we are seeing a significant increase in die sizes. As a result, foundries are aggressively investing as they ramp production at the 3x and 2x nodes. Applied is favorably exposed to foundry investment. In our first quarter, we saw 75% increase in revenue from these customers and expect sequential growth of over 40% in our second quarter, driven by record quarterly sales in our front-end products, metal deposition products and implant. Mobile devices are also driving NAND bit growth rate, which is expected to exceed 70% this year. As a result, NAND manufacturers are investing in new capacity and moving to the 2x and 1x nodes. We believe PCs will be the primary beneficiary of improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. The new ultrabook categories in Windows 8 have the potential to drive a PC refresh cycle and spur growth in the second half of the year. Oversupply in DRAM continues, with manufacturers able to meet the 30% to 40% bit growth that is expected in 2012 by migrating existing lines to advanced nodes. As a result, we expect another year of low-DRAM investment, although we do expect spending to be modestly higher in the second half. Wafer fab equipment spending for 2011 exceeded our forecast ending the year at approximately $35 billion. Lithography investment reached record highs last year, as memory makers implemented device shrinks by upgrading lines with immersion systems. As we look at 2012, we expect another solid year for capital equipment spending and currently estimate wafer fab equipment will be in the range of $30 billion to $35 billion or flat to down 15%. 2011 was a strong year for our inspection, transistor, deposition and electroplating businesses, and we expect to see share gains in all of these areas. However, 2011 was a down year for our share in etch and CMP, primarily due to spending mix. Over the past 4 quarters, we have increased the number of tools under service contracts in Asia by over 20%, and as we progress with the Varian integration, we see opportunities to expand our implant-related services in the region. During the quarter, we launched 2 new CVD applications on the producer platform, enabling enhanced device performance for our customers and adding to our served market. We also released the fifth generation of SEMVision, our industry-leading defect review system. As the industry’s 450-millimeter roadmap becomes clearer, we continue to work closely with our customers and focus on developing early test wafer systems. In Display, the low absolute level of orders show that we are continuing a long bottom of the current down cycle. TV unit shipments grew modestly in 2011, and holiday sales were encouraging, helping to reduce inventories and close the gap between capacity and demand. However, we do not anticipate significant new investments in television-related capacity until late in 2012. In order to reduce our breakeven point, we've implemented a range of spending controls while continuing to invest in targeted product development. Our customers are starting to transition new technologies into volume production, specifically metal oxide transistors and low-temperature polysilicon for OLED and high-resolution LCDs. We expect these next-generation factories to increase the served available market for our CVD and PVD products by over 30%. In solar, end market demand exceeded all expectations in 2011, with installations ending the year in the 26- to 28-gigawatt range. This was driven by an acceleration of panel consumption in Europe late in the year, combined with strengthening demand in China, Japan and the United States. Germany alone installed 4 gigawatts in the last 3 months of the calendar year. We expect strong end market growth to continue and anticipate 2012 installations to be in the range of 28 to 35 gigawatts. In 2011, we capitalized on the industry's rapid capacity expansion, gained market share and delivered strong operating performance. While the industry is currently in a period of capacity digestion, several top-tier manufacturers have been running their factories at close to full utilization. We are also seeing unnecessary rationalization of capacity, as less competitive players consolidate or exit. Given the depth of this downturn and equipment demand, we are taking significant steps to reduce our cost structure in EES. However, we remain confident in the long-term potential of this business. Cell efficiency is becoming increasingly important for customers and as new technology is adopted, we expect to see an increase in demand for our leading-edge products as some portion of the industry's current capacity becomes obsolete. In summary, Applied began 2012 with a strong first quarter, and we enter our second quarter with order momentum, driven by our semiconductor businesses. Visibility for the second half of the year is limited, but we're optimistic about 2012 and expect the third consecutive year of wafer fab equipment spending above $30 billion. Now let me hand the call over to George for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?
George S. Davis: Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. For the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied delivered revenue of $2.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.18, both above the high-end of our outlook, led by strong net sales in our Silicon Systems business. The results included Varian's financial for the fourth quarter, which contributed net sales of $202 million and approximately $0.013 in non-GAAP earnings per share. Applied's orders in the first quarter increased by 26% to $2 billion, as an increase in SSG orders offset softness in AGS and a weak environment for EES and Display. Our backlog decreased by 10% to $2.2 billion. The decrease reflected a 0.92 book-to-bill ratio and negative backlog adjustments of $146 million, partially offset by $94 million in Varian backlog acquired. The negative items consisted of $99 million in financial debookings with the balance from cancellations and foreign exchange effects. Financial debookings are made when the expected delivery date for an existing order moves beyond our 12-month policy window. Our non-semi businesses accounted for over 75% of the negative adjustments. Net sales were flat at $2.2 billion, exceeding the high-end of our outlook of down 5% to 15%, primarily due to SSG performance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40.7%, up 1.2 points sequentially, driven by higher mix of SSG revenue that was partially offset by a $31 million inventory adjustment in EES. Non-GAAP gross margins excluded the effects of Varian acquisition adjustments, which I will take a moment to explain. In accordance with purchase accounting rules, Varian's balance sheet was adjusted to fair market value with inventory essentially written up to sales price. This adjustment, along with the amortization of intangibles, was reflected in cost of sales. The adjusted inventory is expected to be consumed by the end of our second fiscal quarter. Varian acquisition-related charges in Q1, including the purchase accounting adjustments, deal cost and integration costs, were $153 million, of which, $96 million were reported in cost of sales and $57 million were included in operating expenses. We are very focused on exceeding our synergy goal of $50 million to $60 million by the end of year 2. Our efforts since the close have been productive and we believe we will exceed the high-end of our 2-year target and will reflect more than 50% of our announced savings in our fiscal year-end run rate. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $546 million, slightly better than the low-end of our target range due to favorable onetime items and spending controls across the company. We expect our non-GAAP OpEx in Q2 to be $565 million, plus or minus $10 million, with higher investment in Silicon Systems and lower shutdown savings, being mostly offset by lower spending in our non-semi businesses. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3 billion, down $4.2 billion from Q4, reflecting cash from operations offset by the Varian purchase and $304 million in cash returned to shareholders in dividends and share repurchase.  Operating cash flows were $181 million or 8% of net sales. The cash flows reflect the impact of certain Varian closing and initial integration costs, continuing decreases in customer deposits in non-semi as we draw down deferred revenue and our annual variable compensation payout. We expect a strong recovery in cash from operations in the second quarter. Our capital allocation priorities are to make organic and inorganic investments that provide attractive long-term returns. We are also committed to increasing the dividend, in line with the growth of the business, and to utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash after investment and debt service. Dividend payouts in the quarter were $104 million, and we used $200 million to purchase 18.3 million shares at $10.95 per share. Next, I will comment on our operating segments. Silicon Systems Group orders were up 53% to $1.4 billion, reflecting demand from foundry and NAND customers. Net sales increased 26% to $1.3 billion, above the high end of our expectations, led by a more than 75% increase in our revenues from foundry customers and growth in memory-related sales. Customer concentration remained high with 3 customers accounting for approximately 70% of revenue. The non-GAAP operating margin increased to 28.7% and operating margin dollars grew by 36%, reflecting the addition of Varian's equipment business. In Applied Global Services, orders were down 8% to $517 million, driven by low customer factory utilization levels. We anticipate these levels to gradually improve throughout the year. Net sales in AGS of $534 million were at the midpoint of our outlook of down 10% to 20%. As a reminder, our lower guidance anticipated the absence of $71 million in some fab revenues that were reported in the previous quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin dropped to 21.2% on lower revenue. In Display, orders increased modestly to $40 million. Net sales were down 39% to $104 million, in line with the downturn. Tight spending controls enabled the group to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin of 7%. In EES, orders declined to $33 million and net sales declined 34% to $207 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was negative 8.2% on lower revenue and an inventory adjustment of $31 million. We have taken several cost actions in EES to date including workforce reductions, shortened workweeks, product program rationalization and spending controls. Over the past few quarters, operating expenses have been reduced by approximately 20%, and we have removed over 50% of our manufacturing cost structure. Given the uncertain period to an uptick in demand, we are continuing to look for additional cost-saving opportunities in order to further lower breakeven levels. We'll provide an update of these actions at the Investor Analyst Meeting in March. Now I will cover our targets for what is shaping up to be a very strong second quarter, led by our semiconductor businesses. We expect SSG net sales to be up 15% to 25% due to strong sequential growth in foundry spending. In AGS, we expect net sales to be up 5% to 10%, driven by improving customer utilization levels. In Display, we believe net sales will be in the range of flat to down 25% off a low base, as the industry continues to absorb overcapacity. In EES, we expect net sales to be down greater than 40% due to continuing soft demand and the drawdown of backlog and deferred revenue. We expect our overall net sales to be up 5% to 15%, and we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.28 per share, reflecting the positive effect of higher semiconductor revenues on our margin structure. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks George. [Operator Instructions] Rachel, let's, please, begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Question on the equipment [ph] order momentum here, that you mentioned, Mike. The foundry and NAND orders were very strong in the first quarter. Are you managing the company to see those orders sustainable in the near-term or is there kind of a normal digestion period that you're expecting to play out?
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, Stephen. If we really look at the first half, we think certainly with the visibility that we have so far, we think that they'll be sustainable through the first half of the year. I think the question for the second half of the year is we see that NAND spending will continue to rise in the second half of the year, and it's just a question of how much foundry will soften if it softens during that period.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And as a quick follow-up on the EES operating breakeven level, do you have an estimate, George, of where we can think about the breakeven level being for the EES division going forward?
George S. Davis: Yes. Thanks, Stephen. The breakeven level coming into the year was about $800 million. And with the actions that have been taken so far, probably see about $100 million come out of that today. And we'll -- again like I said, we'll cover at the March Investor Meeting, we'll update our progress on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess first question, relative to customer concentration, are you seeing -- what were you seeing price-wise in the industry as we see 1 or 2 guys kind of dominate a big chunk of the order book? Is anything out of the ordinary there or kind of business-as-usual?
Michael R. Splinter: Jim, we really make these agreements with customers just a couple of times a year that really frame how we're going to do business. So I don't think that there's anything that's not predicted. But I think that this is just part of the consolidation that we're seeing, and especially when you think about the trends that are happening in the industry where the smartphone supply chain kind of gets -- is also consolidated to a few players. It's not surprising that we're going to continue to see this high rate of concentration.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That makes sense. And for my follow-up, I guess kind of more of the bigger picture question about the cycles and if they're changing at all, just from the standpoint of historically, when your customers [indiscernible] they probably ordered more, and when they weren't doing well, they ordered less, at the back half of the [indiscernible] we actually saw a change to that or it's actually a little strong, but before the customer stepped up and ordered tremendous amounts of equipment, especially the fourth quarter. Do you think [indiscernible] that customers are going to be ordering equipment [indiscernible] or adding capacity vis-à-vis their own business or do you think that was for a little bit of an anomalistic situation?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, you were breaking up a little bit, but I think I got the essence of your question. And we've been doing a lot of thinking about this particular issue. And the essence, I think, of what's happening kind of has a few elements. First of all, the smartphone and tablet demand is accelerating. So it's pretty fast, and to keep up with that ramp, foundries are going to have to move more quickly. Over the last couple of years, die sizes have doubled or you could say die sizes are kind of going up at a 50% a year kind of level, which is pretty unprecedented for the applications, processors, which are the major silicon consumer there. Then the other thing is that because these die sizes are going up, you've got to move to the leading edge very, very quickly. And as we've all certainly seen, as these smartphones change model, everybody moves to the new model immediately. So there's a lot of pressure for foundries to be ahead on capacity and be in a position to supply the demand that's coming, even though their utilization might be not the 95% or 90% where they use to wait until that point to order significant amount of new capacity.
Operator: Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, first question, if we were to assume, I guess, the higher end of your WFE guide, let's call it flat to down 5%. How would you see seasonality first half versus second half in terms of silicon shipments?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, C.J., if we would take the midpoint, if I could just kind of move your question to if you kind of look at our midpoint of down 7% or so, it's close enough to down 5%, we think that you'd have to see equal first half, second half. And that the kind of puts and takes there would be more NAND spending, a little less foundry spending and a little more DRAM spending, logic, kind of ratable across the year. So if we would think that we're going to be able to get to the high-end of that range to flat, I think we'd have to see a little more foundry spending, probably a little more NAND spending.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That's helpful. And as my follow-up, can you talk about, George, the trajectory of OpEx that we should expect post the April quarter? Clearly, there's pluses and minuses there in terms of volatility to the top line, but as you see it today, what kind of cost savings do you think we could see in the next couple quarters?
George S. Davis: Yes, I think you're seeing some cost savings already in the non-semiconductor areas, but we're continuing to increase spending in the semi again. Really, there's just an extraordinary number of activities going on with customers that are important to do right now for positioning. But we'll continue to see improvements in the cost structure in our businesses that are in the bottom of the down cycle. But some of those are variable. So I think the current run rate in the $550 million to $565 million range is probably a reasonable place to assume we'll be.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So regarding your silicon bookings in the coming quarter, can you give us at least directionally, how do you think about the different segments, foundry, NAND, et cetera?
George S. Davis: Sure, for Q2, Edwin?
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes. Yes. Sorry, regarding your silicon booking guidance. So as regarding the coming quarter, that's all and -- yes.
George S. Davis: Yes, as we said, we said foundry revenues were going to be up significantly. We also see bookings being up as well quarter-over-quarter for foundry customers. Flash had a pretty good bounce last quarter. We see it being kind of flattish, and then, and same with DRAM and logic. So really it's a foundry story as we see it. And that's I guess why we’re calling it the year of the foundry.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Maybe, that's your...
George S. Davis: That -- yes, yes, yes, it was -- sorry, Edwin, go ahead.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Yes, no problem at all. And then one follow up on AGS, just curious how 200-millimeter is trending, within AGS and its booking and revenue in 200-millimeter is still pretty low here, and can you state any kind of improvement there?
George S. Davis: No, I'd say that's a good description of where we are. The -- it's been pretty light on bookings and on revenues at the end of last year, but more so this -- in the first half of this year. We do expect that actually to pick it up though we're seeing signs from customers that they need to add capacity, particularly in selected areas. So we expect it to be a little down overall from last year, but to recover and that will be a source of improvement in the second half.
Michael R. Splinter: Edwin, we think the automotive market is coming back and electronics in there, especially power electronics is going to help drive a little pickup in 200-millimeter. But I think we would be happy if we improve margins and it was flat to up year-over-year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Thanks for taking my question, I have 2 of them. Mike, if I look at memory spending, I understand the secular drivers for NAND. And both NAND and DRAM, it seems like the beginning of the year, there's all this optimism that they come back in second half. But over the past couple of years, it never panned out exactly. I'm kind of wondering like what gives you the confidence this year memory spending will come back in the second half, and I have a follow-up?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, I think if we, first of all, just say NAND spending, I think that talking to customers, it would be the broadening out from the current set of customers to at least one additional customer that we believe is going to make some more significant NAND investments in the second half of the year. Our expectation for DRAM is very modest, so it's just kind of a timing of when they're going to make their investments to move their lines to the next generation. They have -- just to be competitive, they have to keep moving node to node to node. We don't expect any capacity investments in DRAM at all.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then in...
Michael R. Splinter: If I'm mistaken, we got it in the first [ph].
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then just a follow-up. On the Varian synergy, you said you might exceed the $60 million target, where is most of the savings coming from? Is this SG&A or are you seeing a lot of savings in -- on the COGS line too?
George S. Davis: Yes. I mean, when we first announced the synergies, Krish, we said that maybe 60% would be coming out of OpEx, maybe 40% in cost of sales. And what we're seeing is much more opportunity in cost of sales. And so we would expect maybe those ratios to change a little bit. We also have seen some additional opportunities in SG&A, so overall, we think that's why we're confident we're going to be able to increase the number. And as we get a little bit further along, we'll set a new and higher target.
Operator: Your next question comes from Srini Sundararajan with Oppenheimer.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: My question is with EUV likely to be inserted only around 2014. Do you expect additional sales from SADP and maybe quadruple patterning?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. First of all, our view on EUV is pretty consistent with what you said. I just add to that, that as it comes into production, it's really going to come in at one layer, probably contact layer first, get into production for one year or maybe another layer as we go through time. But I think the insertion, because of the costs are going to -- and need to get to productized are going to be relatively slow. So the net of that is that double patterning, quadruple patterning is pretty much here to stay. We kind of view that our SAM gets increased by about $800 million with those applications today as it gets applied to more layers, that'll grow over the next few years. So we think with or without EUV and how it's going to go into production, not much change to the current trends.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. I have just one follow up. Looking back at Varian, can you tell me something that make you feel that you made the right decision?
Michael R. Splinter: I can tell you a lot of things. But let me just start with the Varian team. I mean that bringing the Varian team into Applied has already had some great effects. As you get to see how we're integrating the company, you'll see Varian executives and a number of different jobs throughout Applied. In the end, when you buy a company, you buy the people and the culture, as well as the products. So I mean that's one that we're really excited about, probably more -- way more excited than, certainly, the day we bought -- announced that we bought the company. Then just the way our technical people are working together and finding synergy and issues, areas to do experiments together on. I think we have a great opportunity. These will take some time to talk to customers about and get into solving the customer problems. But I think that's another one that is going to be very, very exciting. And then just the matchup of the strategies. We think the solar product is going to be very good over a period of time. And so when you put all those things together and we save more than we announced at the beginning on synergy, we're still incredibly excited about acquiring Varian. George, would you add anything?
George S. Davis: Sure, I've got to throw in a couple of numbers. But obviously, they were non-GAAP accretive, and they're right out the gate as we said they would be. And in the second quarter, as we look, they could be close to GAAP accretive. So they got a lot of leverage in their performance model, as do we. I think that was maybe underestimated by -- as you could see in the consensus, why we came in so much stronger when you saw an uptick in the semi business. So there is just -- their business model works well with ours. The people are outstanding. And not only are we able to help them in areas, but they've got some practices that, quite frankly, that will help us and we're adopting as well. So it's the kind of acquisition you like to see and everything we've seen so far says it's only better than we thought.
Operator: Your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I have 2 questions. One is we saw actually very strong December quarter performance from a few of your Japanese competitors. But then we saw these competitors guide March bookings down, contrasting what you and your U.S. peers have seen. I was wondering what is your view on F2Q orders in this context and what could explain the difference between the strong order momentum you and your U.S. peers are seeing versus what some of your Japanese counterparts are not seeing in the March quarter?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, well, the Japanese companies typically are on a different fiscal year. And if you look at their order pattern over time, it always moves with more of a 6-month cycle than a 3-month cycle. So I [ph] know that I could say anything more intelligent about what -- how their business goes, but for us, it's clearly exposure to foundries. Our strong position with those foundries that are buying today. And so that's really the essence of it for us quarter-over-quarter and how we see the first 6 months of the year.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then my follow-up question with the year coming to a close, if you look at your market share in silicon equipment throughout 2011, how did that market share progress compare to the targets that you set out one year ago? And what are your targets looking forward one year? If you can maybe highlight some of the share gain opportunities and challenges in your silicon business now.
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. So I said some things during my prepared remarks, but maybe I can just kind of summarize. On the macro, on wafer fab equipment spending including everything, including MOCVD, we saw a pretty big spending shift towards lithography. That spending shift basically on a percentage basis, shrinks our TAM or shrinks our SAM. So we saw a 2- to 3-point downward shift because of that during 2011, primarily -- and that was -- caused a lot of line upgrades, also in logic, a big shift to immersion lithography. We expect that to -- and you can kind of see the change now that we're maybe through that period except for DRAM. I think DRAM's only going to do technology upgrades for a while. But as we look at our product line, we think we have great opportunity to gain share virtually in every area. We did gain share in all of our major areas. ECP gained double digits last year. We gained in metal deposition, in CVD. We lost in CMP and etch where we have good chance to bounce back this year and gain points there. In our Inspection division, we gained last year, at least one point of overall share. We expect, with wins we’ve already seen this year, that we'll also gain this year. And in that area, in Inspection, we really had a shift in the business over the last few years to really the bulk of our business was with the top 3 or 4 manufacturer customers as opposed in previous years, it was quite different. If there's any specific product line that you'd like to know about, we can cover it or we can cover it after the call.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Mike, I had a question, when you thought about the year, you kind of gave some projections for the different product divisions you have. It seems like we've had a little bit of adjustment here. Could you give us a little thoughts on maybe, over and under, it sounds like flat panel and EES might be weaker than you thought, maybe that's offset by better silicon -- semi equipment sales?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. Certainly, back in November when we started, we certainly underestimated where we thought we would -- where we are today with semiconductor equipment sales. As we said, really, the thrust by foundries to get capacity in place has been the biggest part of that. Our flat panel display seems to push out -- has been pushing out. We've been expecting factories in China that buildings have been built to start to get facilitized. Those things seem to be getting pushed out. We're seeing a little bit of capacity digestion in touch panels right now, but we do expect that technology and that product line to come back with the growth in tablets and during this year sometime. In solar, I think this is pretty much what we expected. If anything, we're surprised by how strong the end demand is. So if we look at the kind of effective capacity there, we think there is kind of effective capacity of 40 -- a little over 40 gigawatts. There is nameplate capacity over 50 gigawatts, but when you look at who can make solar cells that will sell, it's really a little bit over 40 gigawatts. If demand gets up to 35 gigawatts, this year, that's a significant closure of the gap of the capacity demand gap that we're dealing with right now. And you could see a more normal kind of buying pattern than we're seeing today.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then the second question I had was just kind of tied to gross margin expectations throughout the year. You have a very concentrated customer exposure beginning the year and it sounds like you expect this to kind of mitigate as we go through the year. So in general, should this improve overall the gross margin structure for the company or how do you think we should kind of trend that out?
George S. Davis: Hey, Chris, that's good question. I think what you're seeing is a couple of factors: Number one, gross margin improving, in general, in our semiconductor businesses with volume and -- but also the gross margin improving as the mix of our business changes in the year. With the softness in our non-semi businesses, what we referred to as the semi-businesses, which is SSG and AM AGS, which is largely serving semi customers, you get a close to a 90% mix now of those businesses which were down in the kind of 80% or less range last year. So you're getting a much better flow-through and that's reflected in the margin.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Mike, question on longer-term. There is certain segments like PVD and RTP, Epi. CMP, where you have more than 70% market share. As your customer prepare to move for 450 nanometer -- sorry, 450 millimeter. Do you think that the smaller competitor can survive, can take and invest in the 450 millimeter and as a result, on that concern, you might begin to get 100% market share on those segments?
Michael R. Splinter: We can always hope that the smaller guys, but they've been awfully resilient in this industry over a long period of time. What we're trying to do here is work closely with the customers, understand their needs and timing so that we don't, first of all, invest too soon or too late, that we put our investments in the places that are going to be needed. I said earlier that we're looking at the early test wafer systems. And we're pretty specifically focused there because that's what our customers need first. So that test wafers can be run, robotics can be tested, defects can be measured and the like. So we're going to make sure that Applied Materials is very well positioned going into 450 millimeter so that our solutions are there for the customers. We're solving their problems in the 300-millimeter generations ahead of 450 millimeter because we believe that there is a lot of risk in transitioning to 450-millimeter. If we can maximize our position in 300 millimeter going into that transition, that will be the best possible scenario for Applied Materials. Then we have to make sure we're managing our spending very tightly so that we don't get ahead of the game or behind the game. But we're going to be lockstep with the customers is the best way that I can try to describe it.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful. And also on the SSD subsegments, where are you most excited about in terms of above market growth? I mean, there is -- you participate in several segments, but my sense is that transistor is becoming a lot more complicated and you have several markets, I mean, implant RTP, Epi, metal gate, if I take all these together, where do you think you see more growth, I mean, if I look at all your SSD subsegments?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, well, I'm certainly excited about all of them. But if you make me pick 1 or 2, especially focused in on the transistors where we're going to see a lot of change. We're going to see a lot of change on the memory cells. So we're getting ourselves prepared to help customers make those transitions. Epi has been one of those areas that doesn't get noticed a whole lot. It's a product inside of our front-end products group. But pretty much now with each generation, there is an added Epi step, at least in Logic and foundry. In the future, we’re going to see a need for Epi in the channels, so we'll have additional Epi steps. We'll see probably in generations to come, Epi needed on memory devices to enhance the performance of the transistors. And then as we go to vertical NAND, I think we got a lot of opportunity on both our deposition, our CVD products and our PVD products. And finally, if you look across all these different things, they're all going to need more and more implants. It was part of the analysis that we did when we bought Varian, but we see the number of adjustments and dialing in of the performance of the various transistors to accelerate with time here. So we think that, if I really, really have to narrow it down, then I get to Epi and implant.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Mike, you mentioned 70% of your sales were from 3 customers. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your order concentration in the last quarter and also maybe the next quarter?
George S. Davis: The order -- this is George, Vishal. The order concentration was right on top of the revenue concentration, maybe just slightly higher. And again, it's looking sort of equally concentrated in the second quarter.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's great. And maybe you could talk a little bit about your expectations for revenue growth this year. You said that litho was very strong last year. How do you see your revenues in fiscal 2012 grow compared to overall industry?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, maybe we could wait for that projection until our March Analyst Meeting. I think we'd feel a little more comfortable and have a little better view of what's going to happen in the second half. I think you get an idea from the discussion about there's pretty good momentum in our view that wafer fab equipment spending will be over $30 billion. So I think we're quite confident on where we'll be with our semiconductor and service. The service division will grow quarter-by-quarter through the year. I think where there are still a lot of uncertainty as in our other 2 divisions, the Display and EES, on exactly how their performance is going to trend through the year. So if you'd give us a little bit of a pass for a few weeks here before our Analyst Meeting, I will give you a lot more detail then.
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of things. Firstly, on your comments on market share in response to an earlier question. I wanted to probe a bit into the etch and CMP portion, and you said customer mix was the reason overall share was lower, because my interpretation that the market share for etch and CMP is lower at the top 3 customers or how should we think about that?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, our etch business is very much towards DRAM and memory in particular. So especially during this last year, we suffered quite a bit because of the low spending in those areas. Spending mix was down, so that certainly hurt our Etch business substantially. Where we're really focused with the etch business is on the patterning applications. We think that the solution that we have with Centris offers better performance, certainly better productivity and uniformity than the competition. So we think our focusing in into that area should give us an opportunity to grow back some share this year and then in the years to come. In CMP, it was really just a spending shift, who is spending more, who is spending less. And I think that we'll see a pop back on CMP share this year to previous high levels.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on a longer-term question on NAND flash, SanDisk, on its Analyst Day, said a few things, what -- they expect the long-term cost reductions for NAND to almost decline in half to maybe 30% a year down from the low-50% it used to be. And they expect, I guess, that might slow down the rate of wafer capacity adds. How do you sort of think about NAND evolution, longer-term, if the cost reduction were to slow? And what can AMAT do that could push the cost reduction backup?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. I'm not sure of everything they said. But NAND certainly benefited from being able to go faster than Moore's law for many, many years. So I think that's one of those impacts that's affecting NAND. I still think the biggest cost reducer is how much of their mix they can put on multicell -- multi-bit devices. But I think the demand is going to continue to grow pretty rapidly because of this mobile trend. So perhaps more of the footprint -- more of the dollar footprint ends up in NAND or we decide we don't need as much capacity. But I think the trend has been pretty clear that for servers with Windows 8 and ultrabooks coming in SSDs will grow dramatically. And the amount of flash in the rest of the mobile world will grow with each generation. We're working very hard, double patterning, quadruple patterning works the best in flash. Then moving to a vertical NAND structure should allow them to get significant cost-per-bit reductions. So we're working very closely with them. We think we have some enabling technology, especially for vertical NAND. But that's still a few years away from getting to production, but those discussions are happening today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolas.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Mike, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're expecting bit growth in DRAM to be about 30% to 40% this year. Do you see a level of where you would get a tipping point for where actual capacity buys return versus the conversions you're seeing today?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, we think it’s -- certainly above 40%, more like 50% if we start to see a bit growth over 50%, we think some capacity will have to be added. But last year was pretty close to 50% and we didn't see -- we just saw, really, conversions coming through. So we'll wait and see, but I think the key still with DRAM is how fast do PCs and how fast the ultrabooks get adopted, and how many -- how much DRAM capacity per PC. That starts moving up, you could easily see 50% growth, but we just don't see it today.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. Great. And maybe a question for George in terms of the cycle times or the lead times you guys have been doing on the SSG side of things. It sounds like you still got -- you still have a pretty high level of turns business given the orders and the rapid turn in revenues, is that still the case?
George S. Davis: It is still the case. But again, the cycle times while they have improved ratably over time, a lot of the turns business reflects certain customers' preferences to kind of bring orders very close to the shipment date even though you have letters of understanding and a lot of dialogue with the customers over time. So some of that turn business is really a reflection of the way of operating in certain customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Pang with Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Two quick ones. First, on the $30 billion to $35 billion on the wafer fab equipment, what's the -- on the low end of that, what changes in your view?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, if we would go to the low end of the spectrum, we would not see -- we would see DRAM stay at the low level that we're seeing in the first half and we'd see a bigger drop-off in foundry and logic.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So your current outlook, that $30 billion, the DRAM would still be lower than where it is right now or what you're projecting right now?
Michael R. Splinter: So we wouldn't see any improvement in the second half.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, and the second question is also on the wafer fab equipment spend, you commented that litho was a bigger percentage in 2011. Do you think that trend continues in 2012?
Michael R. Splinter: I think it will remain roughly flat in 2012, maybe down a little bit as a percent as the trend that we cited for last year played out.
George S. Davis: And again, I think our view is you start to see that change maybe come down a little bit as memory starts to add capacity instead of upgrading [indiscernible].
Operator: Your final question comes from Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: I was wondering if you could comment on the competitive environment, obviously, one of your major competitors is buying another competitor, with SSD and [ph] etch combined. Now I'm just wondering if you -- how do you see the competitive environment going forward?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure, well, we certainly weren't surprised by that move. Obviously, we've been on this strategy for a while with the acquisition of Semitool and then Varian. So that's we certainly been trying to position ourselves ahead of the competition. As far as this particular move, we're pretty familiar with both of these companies and have competed with them for many, many years. As we cited, we think we've been in a strong position and improving our share in electroplating and in CVD and PVD, which have been prime competitive fronts with one of those 2 companies. We've had less success in etch, but we know certainly the game plan here, and feel like we know how to compete, and we'll meet them in the marketplace as we always do.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then one more question, I know that you want to maybe wait a bit until -- and give us more details later, but obviously, we've had pretty strong growth and you're guiding for strong growth in SSD through April. But for just like assuming a flat, July and October, it looks like fiscal year SSG numbers could be up 10% to 15%. I'm just wondering if we could expect a softer July and October?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, I don't think we can really say. I think we tried to outline what we thought on the spending. If we would pick the middle of our range on WFE, we think our performance would be flat first half to second half, but right now it's pretty hard to nail down that range.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Mark For your question. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's Applied Materials' earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Although we have a lot of ground to cover today, we'll be sure to leave plenty of time for your questions.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials ended our fiscal year with solid fourth quarter results despite a challenging environment for all of our businesses. 2011 has been the most successful year in Applied Materials' history, and we set records for revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow. Our semiconductor business delivered a strong performance despite a significant drop-off in wafer fab equipment spending in the second half of the year. Our services group exceeded their previous peak revenue, driven by growth in our spares and services business, combined with robust demand for 200-millimeter equipment. EES generated $2 billion of revenue and operating profit of over 20%, while in display, we established leadership positions in the emerging touch panel and high-resolution mobile display markets. I'd like to thank the entire Applied Materials team for their achievements in 2011. Shortly after the close of our fiscal year, we completed our acquisition of Varian Semiconductor. The Varian acquisition extends Applied's portfolio, with best-in-class ion implantation technology, a market that represents an annual opportunity approaching $1.5 billion. The combination of Applied and Varian creates the industry leader in transistor technologies. This will allow us to significantly enhance the value we provide to customers, as we partner with them to develop the next generation of transistors that are at the heart of faster, more power-efficient chips. We're delighted to be welcoming Varian's talented team to the Applied Materials family. 2011 was a tale of 2 markets. We saw first half strength begin to falter during the summer months as economic headwinds grew. Although we believe the prospects for a sustained economic expansion are improving, and we see ratable growth and demand for semiconductors, flat panel displays and solar, near-term capital equipment spending environment remains challenging. We expect the semiconductor equipment market will begin to improve in early 2012 and strengthen through the second half of the year, as manufacturing capacity is absorbed and customers transition to next-generation technology in the volume production.  We believe we will see a clear increase in SSG orders in our first fiscal quarter. Demand for mobile products is growing at a healthy rate. We expect tablets and smartphones to lead end-of-year holiday sales and reach our full year projections of about 65 million and 470 million units, respectively. As these devices fuel consumption of solid-state storage, we believe NAND investment will continue to grow, representing as much as 25% of total WFE in 2012. Mobile devices are also driving demand for application processors, translating to high foundry utilization at the leading nodes. We expect foundry investment to, once again, constitute the largest component of WFE next year. While 2011 continues to be a strong year for logic investment, DRAM bid growth is in the 40% to 50% range, and DRAM suppliers can meet demand by focusing on technology node strengths. Consequently, we expect DRAM investment to remain at its current low levels in 2012. We estimate that 2011 WFE spending will end up in the $30 billion to $33 billion range, and as we look to 2012, we see capital equipment spending being down between 10% and 20%. Over the past year, there have been significant puts and takes for new fabs and fab expansion projects, and these have impacted our expectations for our share gains, the largest of which was our estimation that DRAM spending would improve in the second half. We believe that we have increased our share in inspection, transistor products, DVD, CVD and electro-chemical deposition. However, we now see 2011 as a down year for etch and CMP, primarily due to spending mix.  Overall, this has been a strong positioning year for SSG. We launched 15 new products, refreshing and extending our portfolio, while increasing our investment in 450-millimeter, in line with the industry's roadmap. In the quarter, we achieved a number of critical positional wins at 3x and 2x nodes in logic and foundry, specifically in the high-k metal gate and patterning etch applications. We also saw significant volume orders from foundry customers for new applications in defect review, inspection and Epi.  In service, semiconductor utilization rates and total wafer starts fell for the third consecutive quarter. We expect current levels to remain relatively unchanged in calendar Q4. In addition, we are seeing a significant reduction in demand for 200-millimeter equipment, as these customers become increasingly cautious and shift some capacity to 300-millimeter. However, against this backdrop, AGS achieved record revenues in 2011. We demonstrated sustained progress towards model performance and increased our service penetration in Asia by nearly 30%.  In display, we maintain our view that LCD TV growth will be around 10% in calendar 2011, which is not sufficient to drive new capacity additions. Customers are delaying their investments, including their plans to build new factories in China. Although we believe we have reached the bottom of the LCD capital equipment cycle, signaled by the extremely low level of orders for our display products, the rate of recovery will depend on an uptick in TV sales, both in the developed and emerging markets.  Over the past year we have seen strong demand for mobile display technologies, with our product lines serving these areas comprising 1/3 of our 2011 Display revenue. However, we currently see softness in these markets as the initial buildout of manufacturing capacity is absorbed. In solar, we now see panel installations for the year ending up in the 22- to 24-gigawatt range, up approximately 25% year-on-year. Our outlook for the end market is healthy, and we expect panel demand to grow 10% to 30% in 2012. We see continued strength in Germany and Italy, with a significant growth in the Chinese, U.S. and Japanese markets. With module spot prices approaching $1 per watt, competition between the panel-makers is intensifying. As prices fall, module efficiency becomes incrementally more important, accelerating the adoption of advanced technology.  2011 was an outstanding year for EES. During the period of rapid expansion and capacity, we fully capitalized on our strong product portfolio by increasing our market share and delivering strong operating performance. I'd like to acknowledge our solar team who rose to the challenge of meeting a ramp that far exceeded our expectations. However, as the industry absorbs the large amounts of capacity shipped, we are seeing a steep decline in orders and revenue. While our top-tier customers will add modestly to their capacity next year, we see the majority of our business in 2012 being generated by products that enable customers to upgrade their lines to increase module efficiency or reduce costs.  In summary, our performance in the fourth quarter capped a record year for Applied Materials. Although we enter our new fiscal year in capacity-driven downturn, we look forward to 2012 with optimism. The macroeconomic environment will ultimately determine how quickly capital equipment spending recovers. However, we believe we have passed the bottom of the order cycle for the company overall. With our market-leading technology, broad product portfolio, the addition of the Varian technologies and our talented global team, Applied is well positioned to grow faster than our markets in the year ahead. While keeping our spending aligned with the business environment, we will continue to invest aggressively in the technologies and products that we believe are critical enablers for our customers and for the long-term growth of our company. Now let me hand the call over to George Davis for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?
George S. Davis: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. I would also like to thank Applied's employees for their part in making fiscal 2011 our most successful year in company history. We delivered $10.5 billion in net sales, GAAP earnings per share of $1.45, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.30 and $2.4 billion in operating cash flow. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied delivered both revenue and non-GAAP earnings slightly above the midpoint of our outlook and generated nearly $700 million in operating cash flow, which included a nonrecurring tax refund of $276 million. Our orders in the fourth quarter decreased by 33% sequentially to $1.6 billion due to lower bookings in all of our businesses, including a steep drop in EES and Display. Our backlog decreased by 26% to $2.4 billion, including negative adjustments of $271 million, driven largely by the pullback in solar and display spending. Financial debookings were $178 million, and cancellations were $74 million. As a reminder, financial debookings are made when the expected delivery date for an existing order moves beyond our 12-month policy window. Net sales declined by 22% to $2.2 billion, with lower-than-expected revenue in display and EES, slightly offset by higher-than-expected revenue in AGS. Non-GAAP gross margin was 39.5%, down 3.3 points sequentially, primarily due to lower revenue and related factory absorption costs. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $478 million. Excluding onetime items, they would have been approximately $500 million, just below our expectation of $510 million. We expect our non-GAAP OpEx for the current quarter to be $560 million plus or minus $10 million. This forecast includes approximately $60 million for Varian OpEx and is otherwise flat with our fourth quarter run rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6%. Our GAAP rate was a benefit of 32.7%, reflecting the tax refund I previously discussed. This benefit resulted in an increase in GAAP earnings of $0.13 per share, but was excluded from non-GAAP earnings per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the year was 28%. In 2012, we expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%. On November 10, we finalized the Varian transaction. The final price, net of cash and investments, was approximately $4.2 billion. We expect the merger to be accretive in fiscal year 2012 on a cash basis excluding acquisition cost and accretive on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2014. We expect to achieve annual synergy savings of greater than $50 million to $60 million. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $7.2 billion, up $366 million from the previous quarter. If the Varian acquisition had closed during the quarter, cash and investments would have been approximately $3 billion. Our strong cash flows over the past 4 quarters enabled the company to fund the acquisition without the addition of short-term debt and enabled us to resume our share repurchases sooner than expected during the period of low stock prices. We used $175 million in Q4 to repurchase 16 million shares at an average price of $11.04. And in a year in which we made the largest acquisition in company history, we were able to increase share repurchases by 34% and dividends per share by 14%, while preserving our investment-grade credit rating.  We will continue our strong focus on capital allocation in the year ahead. Our capital allocation priorities are to make organic and inorganic investments that provide attractive long-term returns. We are also committed to increasing the dividend in line with the growth of the business and to utilizing share repurchases as the preferred means of returning excess cash after investment and debt service. We are mindful that economic volatility provides attractive buying windows, and we expect to again be the market buying shares during this quarter. Next, I will cover our operating segment results as compared to our third quarter. Silicon Systems Group orders declined 25% to $925 million, driven primarily by reduced memory demand. SSG net sales were 24% lower at $1.1 billion, consistent with our expectations. The non-GAAP operating margin was 26.6% and declined approximately 6 points on lower revenue. Performance relative to our model was impacted by inventory adjustments, factory costs under absorption and increased investments for customer-related programs across SSG's product groups, including 450-millimeter. In Applied Global Services, orders were down 8% to $565 million. Net sales were up 4% to $629 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.7%. The AGS results included $71 million in net sales for 2 thin-film solar projects.  In display, orders declined 91% to $20 million, reflecting a steep downturn in capacity additions. Net sales were down 23% to $171 million, which was below our expectations of flat net sales. The non-GAAP operating margin of 19.3% reflected the low product volume and a revenue mix heavily weighted toward touch panel.  In EES, orders declined 73% to $86 million, as our customers absorb capacity additions. Net sales declined 44% to $315 million, and the non-GAAP operating margin was 7.3%, reflecting lower revenue and inventory adjustments and product mix effects.  Next, I'll turn to our outlook, which includes the impact of Varian's performance in the relevant segments. Given the volatility in the macroeconomy, we are not making a specific forecast for 2012 net sales. However, I will provide some observations based on the visibility we have today. While our semiconductor-related businesses will benefit from the addition of Varian revenue, the forecast range for WFE spending is still very wide, and it is too soon to know whether SSG and AGS will be higher year-over-year.  Display net sales are expected to be down 10% to 20% in 2012, as the downturn in LCD and touch panel equipment is expected to continue through the first half of the year. As consumer TV demand improves, we would expect a strong pickup later in the year. EES net sales are expected to be down at least 50% following the large buildout of capacity in 2011. In general, we expect the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2012 to be impacted by the recent declines in Display and EES. However, we expect strengthening in our semiconductor business following a bottom in Q1. Now I will cover our targets for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. We expect SSG net sales, including Varian, to be up 5% to 20%. In AGS, we expect revenue to be down 10% to 20%, reflecting the absence of the fourth quarter thin film revenue, lower 200-millimeter sales and fab utilization rates, partially offset by the addition of Varian services revenues.  In display and EES, we believe net sales will be down 40% to 60% as a result of the steep order decline we saw in fiscal Q4. We expect both segments to operate at close to breakeven run rates during the first half of fiscal 2012. We have taken substantial actions to lower our manufacturing overhead and reduced other spending where possible to maximize the performance of these businesses during the downturn. We expect our overall net sales in the first quarter to be down in the range of 5% to 15%. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.16 per share, in line with the bottom of the cycle. Overall, we are continuing to use wider-than-usual ranges to reflect the macroeconomic volatility.  Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, George. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Carrie, let's, please, begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess first question, in terms of your outlook for orders, I was hoping you could walk through the various segments, provide some color as to what you're seeing. Clearly on display and EES I wouldn't imagine too much upbeat commentary, but would love to hear your thoughts particularly around silicon and service as you think about January and April.
George S. Davis: Sure. Again, we think we've bottomed out in SSG in Q4, so we expect a bounce in orders in Q1. And that also, obviously, reflects the addition of the Varian orders. Display, it's going to -- it's the law of small numbers. They're -- they bottomed out in Q4 as well at $20 million north. So we'll see a -- percentage-wise a big bounce but at the start of an increase in orders in the display area. I think EES, it could go either positive or negative. It really just depends. It's coming off a pretty low order level in Q4. So -- and then AGS would -- is going to be, I would say, down slightly in orders, but that's really more a function of the utilization rates we're seeing right now. We think that'll start to come back as semi spending increases.
Michael R. Splinter: C.J., this is Mike. The only additional comment I would make I think is in semi, really, the order uptick will primarily driven, we believe, by foundries and a bit by NAND flash.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Helpful. And as my follow-up, I was hoping I guess you could talk about 2 fronts. First, given kind of the distress you're seeing in display and EES, whether you're making any plans that you can talk about in terms of cost reductions. And then on the Varian synergy side, I know Bob and Gary ran a pretty tight ship there, so I'm curious where you're finding that $10 million to $15 million cost savings per quarter.
George S. Davis: So we've really focused our cost reductions in display and EES on getting our manufacturing rightsized for the environment. Certainly, in display, we're used to cycles, and so we've taken the normal actions there. We've taken very strong actions also in both of the businesses within EES, the solar businesses. We're continuing, though -- as you know, there's a lot going on in all of these businesses, and so we we'll continue with our program spending to make sure that we continue to drive the technology there. In terms of the synergies for Varian, I would agree with you, it's a very well-run business. And -- but we're confident that we'll get more than the $50 million to $60 million annually that we expect out of that. And I would say 2/3 or 3/4 will come out of OpEx. And part of that is just overlap between the operations. And then, obviously, on the cost of goods side we have a global supply chain where we think we can take some costs down.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to ask about potential need to restructure your EES business given that we have such a significant falloff in that business outlook. And that's the first question. And the second one was really tied to when you throw Varian into the mix, are you separating the Varian equipment from the service and the solar business? Are those going into the buckets for your guidance for Q1 and kind of on the orders and revenue?
George S. Davis: Great. Yes, I'll take -- Yes, I can take them. Sure. In terms of restructuring, I think we're -- we have and are continuing to take actions with these -- with our solar businesses to get their supply chain aligned with our global supply chain to make the manufacturing process more and more efficient. They are actually very lean organizations operationally. And so I think what you're going to see is it's going to be -- we're looking at a very strong and rapid falloff. You had a -- over 45% drop in orders in Q3 followed by over 70% in Q4. So it's going to take a little bit of time to adjust to how rapid that is, but we'll -- we accelerated the manufacturing actions. And we think, overall, the basic cost structure of those businesses is pretty solid, and as the business recovers, you'll start to see a good margin performance again.
Michael R. Splinter: Chris, on the Varian organization, already we are reporting the services revenue in AGS. The organization, we're keeping together, obviously, in Gloucester. Over a period of time, as we get more familiar with the organization, how it's run and the like, we'll most certainly have the various products report into the analogous product groups in our company. I think, George, you may want to comment on how we're handling rev rec and -- for Varian during this first quarter.
George S. Davis: Sure. So if you look at Varian's run rate coming into this quarter, so the 3 months leading up, the revenue would have been around, let's say, $240 million, $250 million. We're going to -- we're assuming in our Q1 numbers that you have about $200 million in revenue overall, not because it really is down period-over-period, but there's some rev rec adjustments that we'll take a look at to align with our rev rec policies. About 80% of their revenue is systems-related and about 20% is services, and that will be the breakout that we use in this quarter. And so pretty straightforward adjustment for the first quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: George, just a clarification. Did you say that EES is going to be breakeven over the next 2 quarters?
George S. Davis: We said that they were going to operate near breakeven. We did not -- there's still a lot of volatility in their number. It could be below breakeven; it could be slightly above.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Because last time, if I remember correctly, when you restructured more than a year ago, the breakeven was an annual run rate of $700 million, correct?
George S. Davis: I would say, right now, with some of the spending programs -- we've added to some programs that are outside of the specific operating units. So I would say that the breakeven is more in line with $750 million, maybe $725 million to $800 million depending on mix. You've got -- obviously, we've got different margin structures of the businesses.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Sure. And my follow-up question has to do with Varian's solar overexposure. Should I assume that, that's still small enough that it's not really impacting the EES and EES breakeven point?
George S. Davis: Yes, right now, we're actually carrying the solar activities in the -- in our SSG segment until we get to the point where the product's a little more mature, and then we'll switch it over.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Mike, I have a question on your recovery scenario coming out of -- on the SSG side. You said it was driven by foundry and some NAND. I'm kind of curious to find out, on the NAND side, do you expect it to be from one specific customer? Or is it going to be more broad-based? And what's driving the demand for the CapEx demand?
Michael R. Splinter: It'll be a little bit more broad-based than one customer, but, as you know, our overall customer base is pretty consolidated. The big thing that's driving NAND demand right now is still tablets and smartphones. We think it's still pretty strong end of the year for both of those product lines, and that's what has customers interested in moving a little capacity forward. The application processors on the tablets are getting bigger. That's really the big move in foundries, as well as the sheer numbers growing.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then in terms of -- on the solar side, I was wondering if you had any thoughts on what the industry CapEx for solar would be in calendar 2012? And when you come out of this solar downturn, whenever that is going to be, do you think the industry is going to be vastly different given the fact that half the place might be out of business?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. Obviously, we've known that there's been capacity excess in solar for some time and -- but customers have continued to put on quite a substantial amount of capacity, spent over $10 billion this year. We think 2012 will drop something in half to the best of our knowledge at this point. So if you just start at the solar cell and module suppliers, as you know, many of them are not making money at this time after a very successful start to 2011. I do think that there will be some consolidation in that part of the market, maybe some significant consolidation. How it happens, I think we'll probably see a number of companies go out of business. We've already seen 7 in the U.S. go out, but I think this is going to be a worldwide phenomena. The stronger companies that have access to cash will survive. But the end market through this whole period is going to grow and we think grow substantially because the costs are getting to the point where prices can achieve the $1 a watt -- or module goal we've been striving for, for quite some time. Still a long way from $1 a watt installed, but we're getting a lot closer to parity with other kinds of electricity generation. We'll see that happen, I think, within 5 years for sure. So we do think that there'll be some restructuring in the industry. I think we like our position. We're concentrating on technology and how to help customers lower their costs, improve their efficiency performance, and we're going to continue to drive a roadmap like that going forward. And we think if we do that, so we'll continue to have a successful solar business.
Operator: Your next question comes from of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: One quick question on SSG, is that foundries are driving the upside right now. The question is: How sustainable that is? Because my guess is that your overall utilization in the foundries is pretty low. What you're getting is probably 28-nanometer. And if you can give us some idea what your expectation of how much 28-nanometer capacity is needed.
Michael R. Splinter: Well, let me start out by -- we look for overall wafer fab equipment spending in 2012 to be down 10% to 20%. That's our initial premises. So we think that foundry spending overall is going to be down at pretty much that rate. As the largest part of wafer fab equipment spending, they'll kind of be at the average down. NAND will be up overall year-on-year, and then DRAM flat because it's already so small. And we see logic being down a little bit more than the average. So we're not expecting -- while we're seeing an uptick from a lower level on foundry spending, we're not expecting in our plans that foundry spending would be up year-over-year. Now I do agree that most of the spending that we're seeing right now is on 32, 28, 20 kind of nanometer technologies. That's good for us. We like that, like to continued treadmill. We think that's very, very positive. Utilization at those nodes is quite high. And as the economy strengthens, I do think we'll see fill-in on the older nodes. So I'm not expecting, at least at this point, foundries to make a massive move to reconfigure their older lines to the most modern technologies. So I think they're going to stay focused on 28 nanometers. I think most of their spending across the board is going to be in that range. And I think because of the significant increase in capital required to deliver these technologies, I don't think we're seeing overinvestment at this point. And I see it still strengthening through -- that -- these investments strengthening through the year.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: That's very helpful. Just a follow-up on the EES on the breakeven point. So, George, if you can give us some idea, with reference to the October quarter, you had $315 million in revenue and $17 million in operating income. How do you go down from there to running $175 million kind of run rate breakeven? is that -- where are you getting the cost out? Are you going to have a restructuring in terms of headcount reduction? If you can walk through how are you taking those expenses out from the last quarter to this quarter, that would be helpful.
George S. Davis: Sure. I think a couple of things. One, you're going to see the factory absorption improve. It doesn't improve instantly. As you know, it takes time to bring that down, but that will improve substantially. Also, in the quarter, the operating margin was impacted by some of the -- some inventory reserves that were taken. So that kind of in essence understated the performance at that level. So you have a little more headroom to get to the $175 million. Then the question will be what's the mix of the business that we have overall, whether it's going to be $150 million -- or excuse me, $175 million or $200 million a quarter for breakeven.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess the first question is on logic spending. Obviously, you talked a little bit about NAND and DRAM and foundry 28-nanometer driving the pickup. What are we seeing on the logic side that's been an area of relative strength?
Michael R. Splinter: We think it will be down a little bit more than the average next year, Jim, primarily just driven by when node adoption happens for major customers. So I have nothing severe, but a little bit more than the average.
George S. Davis: But it's a positive factor in the first half of the year. It should be mentioned along with the others.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I'm sorry, I missed that last point. It's a positive -- down more than average, but it's a positive factor in the first half of the year?
George S. Davis: It's contributing to the -- to basically the floor as it were in the first 2 quarters.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I see. I see. And relative to expectations on logic 6 months ago, is it any -- is it significantly different one way or the other?
Michael R. Splinter: No, I don't think. It's not different than we thought it would be.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then going back to the foundries for a second. There's obviously quite a difference in relative health of some of the foundries. Some of whom are doing pretty well, both technically and customer-positioning-wise; other of whom are obviously struggling quite a bit. Yet they all seem to be spending a lot of money. I mean, at the end of the day, how worried are you about a couple of the foundries that continue to spend -- one foundry in particular that continues to spend an awful lot of money without having really any customers behind it, how long you think that can go for?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, one -- that's one of the things we took into our view as we tried to make a projection for 2012, Jim. And I think in one case we've already heard of some ramp pushouts, those are public.
George S. Davis: I think -- Jim, I think there's as much variability in what their spending plans are going to be just from the macroeconomic situation. They're so consumer-based in terms of their demand signals, that I think that will be as much a factor in the coming year as their business models.
Operator: Your next question comes from Srini Sundararajan with Oppenheimer.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just -- my first question is on OLEDs, organic LEDs. Do you expect any revenue from organic LEDs during 2012?
Michael R. Splinter: Srini, do you mean OLED displays?
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Michael R. Splinter: I assume you're talking about displays?
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Michael R. Splinter: We do expect SOME revenue from OLED displays. We're clearly working with our customers. A number of customers are looking at these. They've been primarily focused at smaller display varieties for cellphones and the like. A couple of customers have some strong strategies to move that up to the TV scale. We're working closely with them and do have some revenue from that. A movement OLED would be very, very positive for Applied Materials. There are more layers, more very critical layers, which we benefit from, as well as potentially achieving gains with our PVD -- our PiVot PVD system. But I think these are still in the early days of testing, whether this technology really can be cost-effective in the TV market and offer enough differentiation to attract buyers. So we'll see, but I would say right now one of the reasons we're still quite focused on our OpEx spending in display is because, not only are customers investing in OLED, they're also investing in the new kind of metal oxide transistor, which we're also working closely with them to improve the performance of their TVs. There's other things going on as well, but those 2 things are very, very key to ensure that we maintain and increase our position in that market.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Great. Just one follow-up. Have you taken into account the December 5 reporting of the ITC vote to the Commerce Department regarding the solar tariffs and dumping claims and essentially the problem between China and the U.S. regarding to solar?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, I think the biggest thing for us is to stay focused on our customers and on the products that we're delivering to those customers. As you know, our prices have dropped by 40% or so in 2011 and a lot more than that over the last 3 years and it's done that because we've -- and our customers have stayed focused on investing in new technology, improving efficiency and productivity and manufacturing and driving up the scale. So our both hope and desire is that the industry can continue its development and growth without any interruption.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Two things. First of all, George, I was going back to your financial model that you put out at semicon, and the SSG model at this run rate is more like in the 34% operating margin level. And even if you embed some impact from Samsung from the settlement there, I think you've talked about maybe a couple of hundred basis points impact from that, it's still like 500 basis points lower. And at the time, certainly, 450-millimeter was pretty known that you'd have to invest in that. So I'm just wondering maybe if you can quantify the inventory impact because it seems like it's a significant blip below where the model is. And then I have a follow-up.
George S. Davis: Sure. Tim, we are well below the model and Samsung is -- the Samsung settlement is a factor. It was also a quarter where we had a big dropoff in revenue, so factory absorption is another factor in that. Also, there are inventory adjustments that were taken in the quarter, which had an impact. I think overall, as we said, our spending levels that we see going forward are higher than we thought at the time we put the model out in March. We would expect to continue to see an impact there, but the gap between the model and where we are today will close several points over the year.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Then maybe can you break down backlog for us, the $2.4 billion in backlog?
George S. Davis: About 38% of it is SSG; 28%, AGS; 20%, EES; 14%, display.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a follow-up question on preserving capital in the energy division in this downcycle. Is there a time frame, Mike, that you're willing to give the solar industry a chance to show some demand elasticity or considering a bigger restructuring program? Because I'm quite surprised there hasn't been that -- with module prices below $1 a watt there hasn't been that big pickup in demand. So is there kind of a time frame you're looking at to see some sort of recovery in the industry?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, I think, you're right in the sense there hasn't been a doubling of demand but -- and demand's up 25% this year. We, as we said, estimate it will be up 10% to 30%. Again, as you know, most of the overall demand is driven by government incentives, and in many countries, there are limits to how much governments are willing to spend on or allocate to these markets. We think the biggest growth is going to be in China and in the U.S. and Japan in this next year. China's feed-in tariff that they announced in July is already stimulating a lot of demand in China. We think that's going to probably double where it is this year. But the real tough question to answer is when does capacity get in line with that demand? And if you look at what we think applicable capacity is today, it's between 30 and 40 gigawatts. We think on the high end, next year, demand gets to 30 gigawatts of deployment. So in a market that's very seasonal where you have to have excess capacity to meet demand in certain quarters, if those 2 things would happen in the next 12 months, the alignment on capacity and demand wouldn't be too bad. So if you put those things together, you kind of have your answer.
George S. Davis: And, Stephen, I don't want to imply that we're not taking a lot of action. I mean if you look at the level of production that both of these -- both of our solar divisions were operating under just 1.5 quarter ago, and so the rapid ramp-down getting the manufacturing organizations sized to where they are today and starting to take down the cost structure has -- there's been a tremendous amount of action on the part of our employees and our managers. So -- but it is a rapid and big dropoff that we have to absorb.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: My questions relate to the kind of backlog adjustment. Can you tell us what -- which division did that adjustment came from? And also, if you look at the display -- sorry, if you look at the EES side, there's still $0.5 billion worth in your backlog. How much confidence do you have in those backlog will eventually materialize into revenue?
George S. Davis: Sure. The financial debookings were -- about 2/3 or more were EES and display and really just reflected the steep dropoff that we saw. Obviously, you've seen a drop in orders in SSG and AGS as well, so there's been some minor adjustments there, mostly again, financial debookings. Cancellations were only $74 million of the total overall. So -- and then in terms of the -- what was the other question -- was on the inventory and how we feel about the EES inventory. As you may recall from previous discussions, we don't book anything for these businesses until we get a deposit. So we have deposit in LCs covering much of our backlog in our inventory, and while we would expect there to be a lot of discussion with customers, our economic protection is quite good. And remember, a good portion of our inventory, for instance, is deferred inventory in EES where we already have it fully secured.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Great. That's helpful. And then last question I have is on the AGS side. I remember if we go back to your analyst event, you guys have a pretty robust target for your AGS business going into 2012. I think part of it is recovery on the 200-millimeter which may not materialize. But I was wondering do how you guys feel about that? Do you think that your AGS revenue can still grow in the coming year?
Michael R. Splinter: Oh, absolutely. We're quite confident we can grow our AGS revenue over the next few years. We're very happy with the ability to deliver solutions to customers in Asia. This has been a focus of ours for some time. We grew that part of our business by almost 30% last year, which I think is a great accomplishment for the AGS team. Next year, we think 200-millimeter will be down actually. 200-millimeter had quite a good year in 2011. But applications for power devices, for MEMS, for analog, these kind of applications are going to continue on 200-millimeter, and I think we'll see another cycle in 200-millimeter that we'll do quite well in.
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question on OpEx. If I look at Varian's OpEx before -- in the June quarter, the last reported quarter, it was about $72 million, and I think you said it adds about $60 million to the OpEx. I was wondering if that takes out some of the savings that you expect. And if I look at your OpEx from a couple of quarters ago to now, your core OpEx is sort of flat, although revenues are down about 30% from your peak to January. So can you talk a little bit about the 2 things?
George S. Davis: Sure. Yes. In terms of the -- any reduction with Varian -- and, again, I don't have those numbers in front of me to validate them or not. The $60 million is really carrying forward their current spending plans. So it was consistent with what they were planning on doing over that time period. There may have been some compensation accruals or other things in their $70 million. But we'll update you over time as we pull synergies out of the combined operation. Overall -- what was the...
Michael R. Splinter: The core OpEx.
George S. Davis: The core OpEx, we went -- on core OpEx, we're actually down in the run rate from running around $530 million plus or minus $10 million to running at about $500 million plus or minus $10 million. And what you're seeing, we're actually down further than that in what I would consider to be G&A-type OpEx as we're trying to preserve spending in these critical programs during this bottoming period. So we think at $500 million plus or minus $10 million plus then the $60 million for Varian, that's actually the right kind of positioning for our spending, given the fact that we do expect to start to bounce off the bottom, and we don't want to compromise our ability to compete in these critical opportunities with customers just because we have a weak quarter.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on the SSG front, you mentioned that CapEx you think would be down 10% to 20%. I was wondering if you have a sense of what type of linearity do you expect between first half and second half. And if I take a look at your October SSG orders and if I add maybe like $180 million or so for Varian on average for next year, for me to get to this midpoint of the CapEx guidance, the CapEx outlook that you think you'll get, I need orders to go up at least 40% to 50% in SSG from the October levels. I know you said that orders look to be going up in January, but looking at the pipeline, do you see the pipeline looking like it could approach anything closer to that type of growth off the trough?
George S. Davis: Yes, we definitely think the second half of the year is going to be a little bit stronger. The only place where I'd maybe take a little bit of exception with your math is just the fact that the backlog factors into our outlook in the math. So again, we think to get to the midpoint of the guidance, you would have to see some increase in the second half, but I don't believe it's 40%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Mike, maybe just going back to the industry CapEx forecast you have for next year down 10% to 20%. You mentioned that foundries are obviously the big lever that you're looking at. Are there any other segments maybe, whether it's DRAM or NAND, that you see as potential wildcards also that could be swing factors that get you to either the high or low end of that outlook?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. I think you -- there's only 4, so we can -- it's pretty easy to name them. But I think we see -- we will see, with strength in the economy, some upside in NAND flash, especially if consumers start coming back more strongly in emerging markets. But I don't think that's so much a wildcard as an incremental increase. I think where there can be a wildcard is if DRAM would come back much, much more strongly since it's at such a low level today. We're expecting substantially less than $5 billion investment next year. And if we look back in history, in 2010, DRAM was about $9 billion of investment, and in years previous to that, much higher even than that. So if we were -- if there's a wildcard here, strong DRAM bounce back would probably be it. Foundry and NAND flash we would think would be more incremental and ratable back to maybe where we are in 2011.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Right. That's helpful. And maybe just kind of a bigger picture question in terms of the memory market and their eventual move to vertical device structures, in terms of your market share positioning and applications, or I guess your process segment, where do you see the biggest gains potentially for Applied Materials as the memory market moves to those type of device structures, whether it's CMP, etch? What process segments do you see the biggest gains?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. Well, it depends exactly what kind of memory types get implemented, but if we look both at 2 that people are talking an awful lot today, vertical NAND and then MRAM in certain configurations, these 2 are ones that we've been working on, we're working with customers on. In the vertical NAND, I would say we have some enabling technology that we think will help customers actually implement this in a few years. Epi, of course, is one of those advanced styles of Epi. But we have other unannounced products that also could be very enabling for customers there that we're working with them on. Those would be the 2 biggest ones. I think we'll see incremental capabilities in some of our oxide and high-k kind of products in those applications. In the MRAM, it's a little bit different. That's -- this will be very much a PVD story or an ALD story as you try to put down the multiple layers and then etch them. So our teams are working very hard together because the combination of these exotic materials are being able to etch them appropriately, I think is a winning combination.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffrey.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Two questions, Mike. So given the backdrop of your commentary on DRAM, how should we think about Varian's contribution given that Varian has a lot more bias on its product portfolio towards DRAM? How much do you think Varian could potentially contribute to your SSG revenues in fiscal '12 or calendar '12? And I have a follow-up.
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. I think Varian has very good share across the board, and everything that we're going to be doing in the next few months as we all go visit customers together and work with them is to continue to advance that. What we see is the big opportunities coming up, the most obvious opportunities are in some material modification applications where we think we can increase the number of implants to help improve patterning, line edge roughness and the like and really play a much stronger role particularly in the foundry area.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. I have a follow-up. This is for George. So, George, given that you have the advantage [ph] on the SSG is going to be much more on your revenue side, how should we think about gross margin trajectory through 2012?
George S. Davis: I think from a mix standpoint, you saw we had some margin recovery, obviously, year-over-year this year with thin film coming out, but we still were -- with about $2 billion in revenue in EES, the gross margin structure of those businesses is not as high as, obviously, the gross margin structure in the semiconductor business. So we would expect, just from a mix standpoint that, that should have a positive effect on gross margin.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just one housekeeping question. Did you call out what your fiscal year-over-year sales in silicon is going to be for 2012?
George S. Davis: Well, what we said overall is that we thought it would be up almost 10% to 20% year-over-year as a range. But obviously, if -- we'll just have to see whether or not it's enough to offset whatever -- that's assuming a certain level of wafer fab equipment. What we said -- excuse me, we said it would be up that much in the first quarter. But what we believe for the full year is it's possible to be up even in the face of a down year because of the addition of Varian. But we're not -- we don't have a specific guidance yet because, quite frankly, the range is just so broad on the full year that trying to do that would be -- it's just too early in the year.
Operator: Your final question comes from Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: I had actually had a question on the display business. It sounds like oxide TFTs are actually starting to gain some traction at the display guys over in Asia. Just wondering, if that does in fact happen, how does that affect the long-term outlook for your display business?
Michael R. Splinter: If metal oxide transistors come into play, it will be a positive for Applied Materials. At a minimum, we think we would get one more application layer for that technology transition. Still, we think it's a little early. People are -- have to solve a lot of technical problems, but we're working closely with them, particularly to ensure that the defect levels and the mobility levels of these new transistors really meet expectations and deliver viewer improvements, because that's really what's needed for the adoption to take place.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: And how does the -- how does your dollar content, I guess, change with oxide TFT versus amorphous and as well as compared to LTPS?
Michael R. Splinter: Okay. So on LTPS, it would be the most positive for us. So it, nominally, let's say LTPS would be up 20% for us, metal oxide is kind of in the middle at 10%. And if he called amorphous 1.0. And you didn't ask me about OLED. So -- that would -- OLED would be up more.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Got it. And my understanding is you're only are addressing the back plane, though, for OLED. Any plans on the front plane?
Michael R. Splinter: Not at the current time.
Michael Sullivan: We'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. The replay of our call will be available on our website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Carrie, and good afternoon. Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Sweeney, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.  Today, we'll discuss the results for our third quarter, which ended on July 31. Our earnings release was issued just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time, and you can find a copy on our website at appliedmaterials.com. Also on the website is our quarterly financial highlights presentation, which provides additional details.  Mike Splinter will lead off today's call with comments on the business environment along with our results and strategies. Next, George will discuss our financial performance in Q3 and our expectations for the rest of the year. We'll then open the call for your questions. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. Applied Materials delivered solid third quarter results in an increasingly challenging business environment. We posted revenue of $2.8 billion and an operating margin of 24.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35.  Over the past 3 months, we've taken a number of important steps towards completing the Varian acquisition. On August 11, Varian shareholders voted to approve the merger, and to date, we have received regulatory clearance from Israel, Germany and Taiwan. We're still awaiting approvals from the U.S. and China. We're committed to closing the transaction, which we now expect to occur in October. We are excited about the opportunities that we will deliver to our customers, shareholders and employees by combining the strengths of these 2 companies.  Q3 was another excellent quarter for our solar business, and EES is on track to deliver close to $2 billion of revenue for the year. Overall, I'm pleased with the strong execution demonstrated by all of our businesses during a period of uncertainty in the global economy. In recent weeks, fears about the state of leading economies and slowing growth in Asia have highlighted the fragility of the global recovery. Uncertainties about demand are causing a number of our customers to reassess their investment plans and push out orders. Although we firmly believe that the fundamental growth drivers within our markets remain strong, today, we are seeing a weaker near-term outlook across all of our businesses.  Based on our view of the next 2 quarters, we have taken action to ensure our spending remains aligned with our business environment. We are proactively managing our operating expenses and adjusting variable spending. We will continue to invest in new products that are critical to our customers and for our long-term growth of our company.  Let me now provide an update for each of our segments. In semiconductor, back-to-school PC sales have been disappointing, further contributing to weak PC shipments for the year-to-date of around 230 million units. Consequently, we do not expect DRAM investments to increase from the low levels seen in the first half. We believe that technology conversions will be sufficient to support the 40% to 50% DRAM bit growth now projected for 2011.  Smartphone growth for the past 3 months has been strong, and tablet sales for the second calendar quarter were consistent with our full year estimate of around 65 million units. However, strength in these areas was not adequate to offset slowing demand for PCs and weakness in consumer electronics, causing foundries to delay their investment timing. We've seen demand from our foundry customers soften significantly in the past 6 weeks as low utilization at the trailing nodes leads them to reuse capacity at advanced nodes.  As a result, we now believe 2011 wafer fab equipment spending will be in the range of $29 billion to $32 billion, roughly $1 billion lower than the estimate we provided at SEMICON West. Looking further ahead, our outlook remains healthy. The adoption of high-performance mobile products is just starting, and the next generation of multi-core processors used in these devices will have significantly larger die sizes, driving both increased capacity and the adoption of advanced nodes. Although we currently see at least 2 quarters of softness in wafer fab equipment, the fact that many clean room shelves are in place means a turnaround could happen quickly once consumer demand signals strengthen. SSG launched 8 new transistor and interconnect products this quarter, while achieving a number of positional wins and double patterning Etch, copper CMP and Brightfield inspection. However, as a result of the weakness in DRAM and foundry spending, we now believe our 300-millimeter wafer fab equipment share in 2011 will remain roughly flat compared to 2010. In service, we saw a decline in semiconductor utilization rates, combined with a minor reduction in wafer starts in the second calendar quarter, consistent with softening in demand and inventory accumulation. We do not expect wafer starts to increase significantly in calendar Q3. Against this backdrop, this was another strong quarter for AGS. Revenue was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter after taking into account the divestiture of our chamber cleans business. We have a good progress towards model performance, enabled by improvements in our 200-millimeter equipment business. In display, TV shipments for the first half of 2011 were weaker than expected, particularly in U.S. and Europe, and we now expect year-over-year TV growth to be around 10%. As expected, the LCD capital equipment market saw a severe downturn in 2011. We are seeing virtually all investments and new TV-related capacity pushing out into 2012, including the leading customers' plans to build factories in China.  In contrast, supply for mobile display technologies remains tight. We continue to see robust demand for our products in this area, which represented 50% of our display revenue and 80% of orders in the third quarter. In solar, panel demand is now accelerating, following a slow start to the year. We maintain our view that installations will be in the 19- to 22-gigawatt range for the year, with roughly 2/3 of these installations in the second half. Germany represents over 35% of this demand, and the postponement of their midyear subsidy reductions means that installers continue to generate healthy returns.  Earlier this month, China announced its national feed-in tariff, which will provide a meaningful upside to the market starting in 2012. While China is the global leader in cell and module production, last year, it represented less than 3% of worldwide panel demand. The feed-in tariff, combined with local incentives, could result in China taking a leadership role in solar installations with modular spot prices moving to the $1.20 per watt range, the economics for PV are becoming increasingly compelling, re-enforcing our bullish view on the growth of this market over the next few years. Although the rate of factory capacity expansions has slowed compared to the first half of the year, our leading customers are investing in upgrades that enable them to extend their efficiency and cost differentiation. This is translating to strong demand for our Baccini double printing product, which enables customer to convert existing lines to next-generation technology.  Our wire saw business has also having an outstanding year. We expect to gain over 5 points of share in the wafering market. In summary, Q3 represented a strong quarter for the company in an increasing challenging market environment. We are continuing to invest in our strategic priorities to generate long-term shareholder value and attractive returns by focusing on organic and inorganic growth in high-return areas. As we adapt to our plans to the realities of our cyclical environment, we will carefully manage our spending and capital structure. Now let me hand the call over to George Davis for additional comments on our performance and outlook. George?
George Davis: Thank you, Mike, and let me add my welcome to everyone on the call today. Applied delivered revenue and earnings at the upper end of our guidance range. We generated $600 million in operating cash flow on strong performance, and issued $1.75 billion in long-term debt to support the Varian acquisition. Our cumulative net sales and earnings per share over the past 4 quarters have been the strongest in the company's history.  Orders in the quarter declined by 25% to $2.4 billion, reflecting softening demand across our businesses. Our book-to-bill ratio dipped below 1 for the first time in 7 quarters. Our backlog decreased 16% to $3.2 billion, including negative adjustments of $248 million, primarily from financial de-bookings. These adjustments are made when the expected delivery for an existing order moves beyond our 12-month policy window. Net sales declined 3% to $2.8 billion with higher-than-expected revenue in display and EES, leading us to the higher end of our target range.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 42.8%, up 90 basis points led by margin recovery in AGS. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $510 million. This includes an adjustment in our variable compensation and certain other accruals. Absent these items, our non-GAAP OpEx for the quarter would have been just under our $530 million target. We expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP OpEx to be approximately $510 million. This represents about a $20 million decrease from our current quarterly run rate. In the near term, our primary focus in OpEx is to tighten discretionary spending across the company while preserving our customer-facing programs and critical investments. In managing our cost of goods, we have a highly variable manufacturing structure and reflects our temporary workforce and overtime capacity in response to the rapid dropoff in demand. We plan to use selective factory shutdowns in our fiscal fourth quarter, and we'll schedule more broad-based shutdowns in our first fiscal quarter of 2012. We have managed our full-time headcount additions carefully through the cyclical ramp and believe we are in very good shape going into the slowdown. We expect to limit our hiring for the time being to critical positions and recent graduates.  Our effective tax rate was 28.8%. We expect our fourth quarter and full year rate to be approximately 28%. We generated operating cash flow of about $600 million through strong working capital management and collections efficiency with day sales outstanding at 59 days, very close to our best historical performance. Consistent with our practice of returning capital to our stockholders, we paid dividends of $105 million and purchased 2 million shares for $25 million. During the quarter, we took a number of actions to strengthen our balance sheet and secure funding for the pending acquisition of Varian. In addition to the $1.75 billion long-term debt financing, we arranged a $1.5 billion commercial paper program to provide a source of low-cost flexible borrowing as business conditions necessitate. We believe these financings will contribute to a lowering of our long-term cost of capital over time.  Cash and investments ended the quarter at $6.8 billion, up $2.2 billion from the second quarter, including the debt proceeds. The elevated level of cash is reflective of our all-cash offer for Varian. We regularly review our capital structure, relative to our capital allocation principles of ensuring a strong investment-grade balance sheet that allows us to fund disciplined investments in the growth of our business while supporting dividend growth, in line with business performance, and use of share repurchase as the preferred means of returning excess cash to shareholders.  Next I will cover our operating segment results as compared to our second quarter. Silicon Systems Group orders declined 28%, primarily due to push-outs by foundry customers. SSG net sales were 4% lower, consistent with our expectations. The non-GAAP operating margin was 32.5%, declining 1.5% on lower revenue.  Performance relative to model continues to be impacted by margin pressure, and increased OpEx spending for customer-related programs across our product groups. We have initiatives underway to mitigate some of these effects. However, we expect that reaching model performance will remain a challenge in the near term, as we increase 450-millimeter spending. Applied Global Services orders and revenue were relatively flat. AGS operating margins returned to more normalized levels in the quarter, driven by the improvement initiatives in our 200-millimeter equipment business, along with an increase in service sales from the recovery activities in Japan.  In display, orders declined 14% with more than 80% of the new orders coming from demand for equipment, serving touch panel and advanced display applications. These orders reflect our strong position in these markets. Display net sales were up 41%. And the non-GAAP operating margin grew more than 6 points on the increase in revenue. In EES, orders declined 48%. Our solar business is now seeing the investment slowdown we anticipated as customers digest the record capacity additions of the past 5 quarters. Net sales declined 12% to $563 million, which was better than our expectations, while non-GAAP operating margin fell 3 points, reflecting both revenue and mix effects. China was, once again, Applied's largest country in terms of overall net sales with 27% of the total, led by solar and touch panel equipment sales.  Now let me talk about our business outlook for the remainder of the year. We are on track for 2011 to be the company's best year ever in both revenue and earnings per share. For the fourth quarter, we expect SSG net sales to be down 20% to 35%, reflecting lower foundry and NAND spending, along with continued spending in DRAM. In AGS, we expect revenue to be in the range of down 5% to 10%. We believe spares' run rates will be somewhat lower in the quarter as customers manage their operating costs in line with lower fab utilization levels. We also expect lower spending in 200-millimeter equipment. In display, we believe net sales will be flat with continuing strength in touch panel demand. In EES, we expect net sales to be down by more than 30%, reflecting the pullback in orders we saw in our third quarter. We expect our overall net sales to be down in the range of 15% to 30%. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.16 to $0.24. Our targets are wider than usual and reflect the volatility both at a macroeconomic and industry level.  Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, George. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Carrie, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Satya Kumar with Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG: This is Farhan calling in for Satya. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on DRAM market. What do you see for next year? Micron had a call earlier today and they are seeing continued weakness next year. Can you just comment on that?
Michael Splinter: I think what we would say is that it really depends on PC growth. So I think PC growth is at the heart of the weakness in DRAM pricing and oversupply during this period and we would have to see PCs get back to more normal double-digit growth than we've -- than we're seeing at the current time. Obviously, prices have been weak. Global DRAM still seems to be quite strong, consistent with the smartphones' and handsets' expansion. So in our frame of reference, DRAM is really weak because of PCs, and until that recovers, we kind of expect the -- a small investment. Technology investments is at a low level. It didn't recover in the second half as we had expected. If you recall earlier in the year, we had projected that DRAM capital spending would come back in the second half of the year. It hasn't come back. It stayed well below $5 billion for the year, which is as low a level as I can remember.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Question is if you can help us understand how much capacity is still in the pipeline to come online at the foundries based on what you shipped maybe last quarter and this quarter to them. So obviously, their wafer starts, and you guys talked about this, aren't growing very fast right now. There's some incremental supply coming online. I'm just trying to get a way to maybe quantitatively think about how much foundry wafer starts have to grow before they would get back to, say, like the 90-ish percent utilization rate level where they would start to order again?
Michael Splinter: Yes. I think since every different customer has a different timing to production, the best way that I think we can characterize that is that it looks to us like something on the order of 3% utilization dropoff. We're thinking wafer starts are roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, but we'll see utilization dropoff relatively flat demand around 3 points, maybe just below a bit more than that, Jim.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: That's helpful. And if I could, for my follow-up, it seems like foundry is pretty low, DRAM's pretty low, NAND is stable because the market there is okay. It seems like if we're worried about they're being another shoe to drop, that would be in microprocessors, is that a fair thought process? And then, how do you feel about that particular segment?
Michael Splinter: I think we believe that consumer electronics and PCs are at the heart of what's causing the supply demand imbalance here. So there's many factors in microprocessors since there's been a shift to tablets. Here, tablets are still strong. So when you aggregate the numbers, that's probably hard to see in a unit volume, but we may see it in a dollar volume.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Mike, I wasn't sure if you're willing to kind of an initial stab at what you think your solar-related CapEx and semi-CapEx will be for next year? I know it's a pretty uncertain time, but how are you thinking about modeling this out for next year?
Michael Splinter: Semi, actually -- well, I'll say a little bit about semi and then go to solar, since we've kind of been on that topic. We're still -- we still think about the current environment as being pretty healthy, and if we're going to model this particular downturn after one that we've seen in the past, it would likely be the '05. We saw 2 quarters down, and then saw some recovery. We think fundamentally that the products in the marketplace, the innovations that have happened, people really want them. And we're seeing consumer softness today, largely because of the macroeconomics. So if we could get those back on track, I think we could see a recovery in a few quarters. In solar, we're already seeing a recovery in end demand. So the key here, I think, is just how impactful this China feed-in tariff is going to be. Prices have come down. They're at the very low level. You already hear the sell prices add $1 a watt, below $1 a watt, module prices. Spot prices, $1.20, maybe the average is closer to $1.40. But these prices have gotten very low, making the investment pieces quite good. So if the China feed-in tariff really comes in and creates a couple of gigawatts, 2 or 3 gigawatts of demand next year. I think we see a turnaround in capital additions, especially by the major Chinese solar manufacturers.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I guess -- Mike, I guess the question is we're going to see some subsidy cuts in Europe and the U.S. at the end of this year. In you overall view, do we have a volume growth here for solar next year? Basically, will China be able to offset some of the potential subsidy cuts that we're seeing in the Western Hemisphere?
Michael Splinter: U.S. will go up next year dramatically. Just -- I think it'll, percentage-wise, probably close to as much as this year. And PV is really taking over in the U.S. substituting. We know that these 8 projects now that concentrated solar. PV has been substituted for concentrated solar. Those projects are already approved. I think we're going to see a pretty dramatic growth in the U.S. I don't think we'll see a falloff in Europe. I think the Germans are committed. They are 35% of the market. Don't think we'll see a down year in Europe. I think we'll see an up year. So even though the lowering of the incentives is helpful, it drives the price down. It improves the performance, the economic performance of the installations.
Operator: Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: I guess, first question, I was hoping you could discuss the dialogue you've had with foundries over the last month. And I guess I'm particularly interested in what the conversations are like around foundry 28-nanometer spend and when you think that will start to come back?
Michael Splinter: Sure. Well, one thing for sure. No one is slowing down on technology. We started 28-nanometer. What we're seeing is that because of the underutilization, primarily at 65 nanometers, they are able to reuse an awful lot of equipment for increasing capacity at 28 nanometers. So that's the first thing that I would comment about that conversation. The second thing is we're hearing very robust discussions around 14 -- 20 and 14 nanometers even today and really talking about the capabilities that we're going to need to deliver and deliver the R&D units this year and to production in subsequent years. And so no slowdown on the focus on advanced technologies, C.J. They're very critically focused on what to do next and how to keep the treadmill going.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: That's helpful. And then, as my follow-up, your nonsilicon business, it looks like we're tracking to about $1 billion here in your guidance for October. So curious, I think we've come down from around $1.3 bullion, $1.5 billion on a quarterly run rate. Does that $1 billion represent you a trough? Or how should we think about that kind of number?
George Davis: So I think we still have to see how the solar market plays out. I think you -- the services side of the business, you consider the services side part of the semiconductor, how do you view it?
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: Yes, yes. I added that in.
George Davis: Okay, all right. So the -- I think with solar, we'll have to see. We expect orders to be down again this quarter in the solar area, so I think that we haven't guided orders. I think we'll have another down quarter for orders pretty much across the board for the company. And so I'd say Q4 -- it's too early to call our fiscal Q4 at the bottom.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc: This is Wenge Yang for Tim. The first question is regarding NAND market. In the last couple of days, we've been hearing some customers talking about adding some additional CapEx in the calendar Q4 to increase the NAND capacity beyond their current 2011 plan. I just want to check if you have heard those discussions in the last week. And if so, could you comment on the scale and also the timing of those additional CapEx in the NAND?
Michael Splinter: Well, I think that we continue to think this market is growing and strong and is pretty much proportional to tablets and adoption of solid state drives and PCs. What a particular customer is exactly doing, I can't really comment precisely, but I would say that this is the one market that is really staying quite strong during when you compare it to the other segments of wafer fab equipment spending.
George Davis: Yes. I think what you're seeing is their markets are holding up well. We have seen -- our expectation for Q4 both on bookings and revenue is that NAND will be down quarter-over-quarter, fairly substantially and is contributing to the falloff that we're seeing. But there is a much more confident tone around the customer base in terms of spending plans for the next year.
Wenge Yang - Oppenheimer: Okay, that's helpful. Just one additional. So your Baccini product has pretty much 100% market share. I just wanted to get your estimate on how much capacities were actually added into the solar manufacturing? And we heard numbers like 40 to 50 gigawatts. If those numbers are true, how does the incoming orders going to look like next year, given the demand is going to remain around 20 gigawatts?
Michael Splinter: I don't think we would agree with a number in that range in delta. We would say maybe cumulative capacity would be close to that range. But one of the things that's happening right now in the solar market is if you can't reach a certain efficiency, you don't sell your panels. So it essentially takes off line some of the older capacity, so you have to get back to looking at what the overall effective crystalline silicon capacity is. And we're kind of thinking it's more like a 35-or-so gigawatts. And I would also add, you have to think about in the second half of the year, essentially 2/3 of the installations are going to happen, so they have to have capacity plus inventory enough to handle those installations, deliver on those installations.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Shankar with Bank of America.
Paul Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch: This is Paul Thomas for Krish Shankar. George, I just want to ask quickly about 450. You did mention that you thought that you might not reach model levels due to incremental spending on 450. I just wanted to get a little color around that. What kind of spending you think you guys are going to have going forward?
George Davis: We took a shot at the SEMICON on that. We said it would be at the $100 million range in 2012. I think our focus all year has been on making sure that we're positioned well in our SSG Group. There's a lot going on in the industry right now, and just kind of building on the technology inflection that Mike was talking about just in the foundries, but it really across-the-board with our customers. So our spending has been coming up at this time, even as our volumes, our revenues are coming down a little bit. So we think that the right thing to do in the near term. It certainly impacts the model in the near term, but we think it positions us well for the longer term.
Paul Thomas - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And maybe just one follow-up on January quarter, you did mention that you were looking at shutdowns also in that quarter. So -- But I imagine you have some flexibility there, but is the expectation then that we're still going to see this sequential declines in January in overall revenue?
George Davis: Yes, I mean, I think what we're seeing is we're seeing orders -- the order outlook for this quarter to be down again. So it's a little too early to call exactly what the revenue's going to look like in our first fiscal quarter. But clearly, we're still going to be in a period of softness. And so, we're kind of in line with the more, it if there's such a thing as a normal slowdown in our business. It's more in line with that, and our shutdown activity will be reflective of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: Mike, if I could ask -- you mentioned that the shutdown looks more like a normal cyclical shutdown. Or given your weakness in the last 6 weeks, is it more of an early sign of a severe shutdown or slowdown that we saw back in 2008? And if so, what are the leading indicators you would be looking at to gauge for a turnaround?
Michael Splinter: So we think this is more of a supply-demand slowdown. If you recall, back in 2008, it was really memory dropping off from over -- almost 70% of wafer fab equipment spending down to 20. We're not seeing that kind of situation here. And I don't think we will see that kind of a situation because the end markets have products that people really want. The beginning of mobility, real mobile computing is just happening. But to your question about what are we looking for to see that we're really starting to come out of this, we're looking for stronger consumer demand for PCs, consumer electronics, particularly TVs, that have been very slow this year and pushing out our orders and demand for capacity there. So it needs to be strong enough also. That demand come-back has to be strong enough to diminish the inventory that's been built in this weak back-to-school period. Now, of course, I think our customers have been very good at lowering utilization, managing their inventory. So I don't think that inventory is as big as it's gotten in past times either, which helps us think that this slowdown can be temporary. But then, the final thing is it really is going to be dependent on something not in our control and that's the global economy and whether we're going to get a little movement away from the volatility that we've seen in the last few weeks and get some stabilization there.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: Mike, just to clarify, in terms of PC growth, are we looking at double digits? I mean, it sounds that would be a meaningful growth.
Michael Splinter: That would be a meaningful number that we would get excited about.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: Got it. And just a follow-up would be could you share any color on how you are trying to manage through this kind of a downturn in almost all of your segments? Is the goal really to just stay profitable in all the segments? Or you mentioned about some share gains in the solar segment. I just want to see if maybe Applied is trying to be aggressive to gain share during this downturn?
Michael Splinter: Absolutely. We're staying very focused on our products and our customers. This is the key to moving through this, stay very close to the customers, make sure that our products are adding value in a significant way to those customers. We believe we had some very significant positional wins during the last quarter. I try to itemize a few of those in the semiconductor area. In the solar area, we really think that the key right now is to really focus on developments in areas that are going to add efficiency to existing lines. Those are things that customers are going to buy whether there's upturn or a downturn. So things like our double printing solution, which adds efficiency. We're working on a number of other areas that will add improved efficiency or improved productivity for our customers. And that theme goes in display as well, where I think you know we've been trying to expand our product line in the PVD. But even more significantly in this time period, we've been able to create products for touch panels, for advanced displays because the consumer and the customers are moving to these very advanced displays. So we've been focused on low temperature polysilicon and metal oxide transistors on OLED TV applications. And these are areas where we can gain -- where both our SAM can expand and we can gain share.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: First question relates to solar. Mike, you mentioned on your prepared remarks that you start to see customer purchasing more equipment for driving increasing efficiency. I was wondering if you can quantify how much of your sales comes from those -- you can almost like quantify a semi-term technology buy versus capacity build? And if all your customers just focused on driving efficiency, what do you think those sales can -- will get to?
Michael Splinter: Yes. So it's a little bit of a complex answer, but in what we've seen so far from our double printing business since we introduced this product, that's produced over $200 million in revenue and is ramping every quarter. So that's been starting to get quite significant. Other products, I think, we've talked about a selective emitter product and we have other ones I'm not going to talk about at this time until we get significant traction with the customers. But the specific efficiency depends on whether you're using multi-crystalline or single crystal and the techniques often vary there as well. But I would just say that every quarter, we're seeing the peak notch-up of like 0.1 or 0.2 and the distribution of sellable products there.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: I see. The $200 million number, just to clarify, that's up to this point? Or is that the last quarter? I'm sure I got the number correct.
Michael Splinter: Sales up to this point.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: Great, very helpful. And then, George, just a question on gross margin. I think the midpoint of your guidances just seems to imply gross margin goes down maybe at 40% or a little below that. I'm just wondering if that was all to do with just lower sales level or is there anything else relating to mix or anything like that related to that, if you can help us on the gross margin line. And how do you look at that beyond the October quarter?
George Davis: I would say 90% of it is sales volume and heavily impacted by SSG. You've got minor puts and takes on mix in the quarter. And so I think if you follow that line, I think you'll be all right on your estimate.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International Group.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Mike, I'm going to ask you what I asked you during the Analyst Day. Given the structural changes in the PC market, what's going to help your customers to step up and increase your spending next year that -- and what I mean is, DRAM prices are near cash costs. And I just don't see any increased box loading.
Michael Splinter: Any box -- increased box loading for DRAM?
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Yes. And technically, in the past 20, 30 years, when DRAM prices collapsed, then, the elasticity kicks in and box loading goes up. And what I hear from your customers and your customers' customers is that they're reallocating their budget to other areas like display. So we're not seeing any increased box loading. And therefore, I see that as a structural change in the industry that is going to trickle back to [indiscernible] industry?
Michael Splinter: Yes. I think the first thing is we have to see PC growth. The second thing is box loading still isn't at 4 gigawatts. We know that it's not at 4 gigawatts a box or -- gigabits, box [ph] of bits. But it's not at 4 gigabits per box at this time, and it certainly can get there. And as the new advanced processors come online in the next year or so, can get beyond that. But yes, the money is going in other places on the footprint to the PC. The other factor is -- that's going to drive DRAM growth is mobile DRAM as smartphones continue to grow in double-digit ranges over the next few years, while they're not going to have multiple -- are not going to have 4 gigabits in a smartphone, but there'll be -- the numbers will start get very, very large and push bit growth.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: I got it. And my follow-up question has to do with Varian. Given the fact that announcement was made back in the spring when fundamentals were different, when are we going to -- when is the earliest we're going to hear how the integration and the revenue and cost synergies going to impact the P&L?
Michael Splinter: Sure. Maybe I can comment on what we're seeing as far as getting closed on the Varian agreement and then George can talk about the revenue and cost synergies. So we expect to have our substantial compliance with the Department of Justice done this very soon. We expect Varian to have all of theirs done by September. And we expect approval from the DOJ then, 30 days after that, some time in October.
George Davis: Yes. And in terms of the financials, we, following close, we'll be talking more fully about that. We certainly are confident that we'll be able to capture the synergies of $50 million to $60 million that we described, and there'll be further opportunities we think as we come together. The fact that things have turned shortly after the deal, we -- our economics on these things are based on a cyclical industry. And so the ability to capture value on this isn't really dependent on your first 3 to 6 months. Whether there's a downturn or not, there's -- we model the fact that there'll be downturns periodically as part of the economics. So we feel very good about the deal and look forward to getting it closed.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Pang with from Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company: On the cancellations that you guys talked about, the financial cancellations, are they primarily at the SSG Group or other groups are also seeing those types of push-outs or cancellations?
George Davis: Yes. The vast majority of the de-bookings were financial de-bookings. The cancellations were about 10% of the total. Of that, about 3/4 were SSG, so it's not a big number. Customers are really hesitant to cancel orders. They're concerned that things are going to come back, and if they cancel that they're going to lose their positioning in the slots.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company: Okay. My follow-up is that, in your change in terms of your wafer fab equipment forecast between your call right now and SEMICON West, is it still foundries that's causing you to go down or other applications in the manufacturing -- semiconductor manufacturing?
Michael Splinter: I think both foundry and DRAM are weaker. And I think if you look at the 6 weeks ago when we made this, there's been a lot that's happened in the macroeconomic environment. Everybody at SEMICON was noting each day, the outlook got more various among the customers that were in attendance there. So there was kind of negative momentum in SEMICON, and then you -- and that was based on a rosier economic outlook than we see today. So I think you have to assume that all customers are affected by the change in the economic outlook. But the big spenders that people were counting on, NAND and foundry, have been more cautious in the near term than people expected.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Back to DRAM for a second. There's an improvement in the overall PC market, and DRAM content per box. Mike, where do you see the process changes? And which technology node, do you see the [indiscernible] additions occurring because the conversions can't stretch out for another technology node? [Technical Difficulty]
Michael Splinter: Patrick, I was very having a very difficult time. You were breaking up there. But And maybe I can repeat and you can see if I have it. You're really asking about technology node adoptions in DRAM?
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, yes. Maybe just in terms of -- if this is clear, in terms of the [Audio Gap], right now, we're seeing [Audio Gap] process technology [Audio Gap] over the next few nodes. Where do you see, I guess, the inflection point where you need to basically buy new line for capacity addition versus just simple converters?
Michael Splinter: Yes, I think I got it now. What we think is -- the bit growth has to be above 50% to really drive capacity versus technology conversions. And this year, we're thinking, right now, some place it grows in the mid-40s. As we kind of alluded to earlier, the bytes per box are not increasing at the rate that we'd like to see.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, a follow-up question in terms of gains that you're looking for in SSG, you mentioned it will be flat. I'm assuming part of that is customer mix. What do you need to see next year to see share gains tick [Audio Gap] 2012 in terms of customer mix?
Michael Splinter: Well, the easiest thing to say will be DRAM coming back in a significant way. But if foundry and DRAM are strong, that's good for us. And if NAND and logic are strong, it's less good for us. Those are kind of the mix aspects, other than, as you know, there's other things going on today like currency and litho taking a bigger overall share of the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard Grasfeder - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: This is Rick Grasfeder in for Mahesh. First question, what's your estimate of foundry utilizations right now? You mentioned about 90% range, I think earlier. Can you give any more color on that?
Michael Splinter: We would say in the high 80s, we would not say 90. And of course, it varies by node where most of the underloading is in, we believe, in the 65-nanometer region.
Richard Grasfeder - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And looking to 2012, for your WFE, I don't think you've given estimates yet, but any color on which segment you think might pick up first, specifically within SSG, DRAM or foundry? What -- where you might start seeing the pickup and as well in EES as far as -- you mentioned you're starting to see improvements in -- some improvement in that segment, but kind of the timing on when you might see that picking back up again?
Michael Splinter: Yes. It's certainly too early to make a projection on 2012. But our view has been that memory will be stronger next year and the logic and foundry will be a bit weaker. That's kind of how we've looked at it. We've, of course, projected that DRAM would get stronger in the second half of this year. So that's part of the reason why we're a little hesitant right now to make too much of a projection on 2012 for DRAM because we do believe we have to see that PC growth come back and sustained growth in handsets and communications infrastructure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Srini Sundararajan with Oppenheimer.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: This question is for George. Right now, it looks like your OpEx is only down 4%. Your sales might be going down much further than that. So what steps are you going to take to get it in line with the sales as it goes down further in calendar Q4, perhaps?
George Davis: Yes. As I said, we're taking the steps to reduce discretionary spending in Q4, so we think it will be down at least $20 million in the quarter. We'll -- I would expect if we see another soft quarter as we expect, it'll come down further in the -- in our first fiscal quarter. As I said, we're being very careful on the OpEx spending, particularly in the R&D area not to pull back the throttle, given the number of opportunities that we're working right now, and it's particularly a critical time for positioning. So we'll probably -- you'll see us be a little more careful on that. Now, we're going into this slowdown in a much better shape than we've been historically. We took a lot of actions in '08 and '09. We also have been very careful with our regular full-time headcount, so we've created more variability in our market in our manufacturing and other areas of the company. If you look at our RFTs today, we're about flat with where we were in Q3 '09. So that helps us going into this, but -- so we think we're in a good position going into it. But we're going to be very careful on pulling that too hard on R&D spending here in the first part, which is what you have to do to take it down further than where we're taking it right now.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: One more question. I think this question is for Mike. I just wanted to know what are your plans on LED product. I think you might have been at it for quite some time, and I keep hearing either that it's going to be shut down or it's going to be going forward, so if you could please comment on what are your plans on that growth market, I would appreciate it.
Michael Splinter: Yes, we didn't prepare to talk much about this today, but we're still excited about this product. We think that we have a system that's differentiated and will add value to our customers. We currently think this market is soft as well as -- because a lot of consumption is dependent on TV growth. So it's an opportune time for us to work with customers and really get them to adopt our technology.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gus Richard with Piper Jaffray.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies: If DRAM growth was 25%, where is DRAM, going forward, sort of on average? Where do you think capital spending for DRAM would be? And I think historically, it's been $7.5 billion, and this year, I think you said it was $5 billion?
Michael Splinter: I'm sorry, I didn't catch the 25 -- Gus, I didn't get the -- PC, did you say our PC growth was?
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies: No, no, no. It's bit growth, it's DRAM bit growth. Historically, its 40% to 50%, and it comes down to say 25%, 20% to 25%, gets cut in half. What do you think cap spending is for DRAMs going forward?
Michael Splinter: I don't think it's much different than it is today. All they're doing today is selected technology conversions of their lines. Maybe they could do a few less, but they have to invest in R&D, and you have to invest in the next node. I think the one thing we do know if prices continue to come down and the only way to stay profitable in the DRAM business is to continue on the treadmill driving the cost per bit down. So we think that we're very close to whatever is called maintenance levels of spending.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies: All right. And then, just as a follow-up. Can you sort of quantify -- clearly, people are going to move to things like technology in the foundry space, so I would expect the announcements within the next year. What sort of revenue opportunity or is there an incremental opportunity for Applied in that kind of conversion that you could -- kind of dollars per fab would be helpful?
Michael Splinter: Yes, I think we could get you that number after the call in a little more detail because you're going to have to talk about a number of passes and exactly what's included in every -- in different companies' spin sets [ph] . So you have to normalize it a bit.
Michael Sullivan: And we'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. A replay of our call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. And we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Carrie, and good afternoon. Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Sweeney, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Today, we'll discuss the results for our second quarter, which ended on May 1. Our earnings release was issued at 1:05 Pacific Time, and you could find a copy on our website, appliedmaterials.com. Also on the website is our quarterly financial highlights presentation, which provides additional details. Mike Splinter will lead off today's call with comments on the business environment along with our results and strategies. Next, George will discuss our financial performance in Q2 and our expectations for Q3 and the rest of the year. We'll then open the call for your questions. Before we begin, I have a quick calendar announcement. Applied will hold an investor and media briefing at the SEMICON West trade show in San Francisco on Tuesday morning, July 12, Pacific Time. We hope to see many of you at the event, and we'll have a live webcast and replay for anyone who won't be able to join us in person. We'll be sure to provide you with further details about the event over the next few weeks.  And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to report that for the first half of our fiscal year, Applied delivered record revenue and earnings. Our second fiscal quarter was one of the strongest financial performances in our history.  We posted revenue of $2.9 billion and operating margin of 24%. Our earnings were at the high end of our target range, and we generated $704 million in operating cash flow. Our Solar business had an exceptionally strong quarter. With net sales of $637 million, EES [Energy and Environmental Solutions] set new records for revenue and profitability. Overall, I'm very pleased with our execution, results and progress towards our strategic goals. Shortly after the close of the quarter, we announced our intention to acquire Varian Semiconductor for a net price of $4.3 billion. We believe this represents our best and largest acquisition opportunity in the semiconductor equipment space. Varian adds a critical component, enabling us to provide customers with a full product portfolio for transistor fabrication and material modification.  Keeping Moore's law in track has become a multifaceted challenge requiring new materials, new chip architectures and new approaches to transistor formation. By combining the strengths of Applied and Varian, our teams will work hand-in-hand with customers to accelerate the industry's technology road map. We are excited about the opportunities this will deliver for our customers, shareholders and employees. Let me spend a few moments on the state of the economy and outlook for our markets. In recent months, we have seen a combination of events that are affecting the short-term economic outlook. Rising inflation in emerging markets and reduced consumer confidence have created an environment that necessitates caution. Unrest in the Middle East has resulted in uncertainty about energy prices and fuel cost. In addition, the economic impact of the tragic events in Japan is still not fully understood.  These cumulative headwinds have recently led some of our Semiconductor and Display customers to push out near-term orders. Although we are mindful of these economic factors, we believe that the fundamental drivers within the electronics sector remains strong. Our customers have a firm foundation for a multiyear investment cycle based on the growing role of emerging market consumers, a global appetite for high-performance mobile products and the infrastructure build-out to support these trends. Let me now provide an update for each of our segments. In Semiconductors, PC unit shipments in the first quarter were weaker than seasonal expectations, down 10% sequentially. Although we believe DRAM prices bottomed out in the fourth calendar quarter, prices remain soft. DRAM capital investment remains low and limited to technology conversions. Tablet sales for the past 3 months were around 6 million units, due to supply constraints for the leading product and flow adoption for new entrants. As a result, our orders from a number of DRAM and foundry customers were weaker than expected.  We still view 2011 as a strong year for WFE [wafer fabrication equipment] investment, and expect spending in the range of $31 billion to $34 billion. Capacity expansions are moving forward. And most importantly, the longer-term outlook for WFE remains strong. Industry fundamentals remain solid, with the top spenders reaffirming or increasing their capital investments. The leaders in logic and foundry are accelerating their plans for the 28- and 22-nanometer nodes, and increasing their investments in leading-edge technology. In addition, low-power, feature-rich mobile devices are driving an increase in process complexity and capital intensity. This trend is good for Applied, with the complexity being added in areas where we are particularly strong. As foundries move from 45 to 22 nanometers for advanced logic devices, the number of process steps addressable by Applied tools increases by more than 30%. Our product momentum in SSG [Silicon Systems Group] remains strong. We launched 4 new products in Q2, and overall, we are on track to gain at least one more point of 300-millimeter WFE share this year. Our Process Diagnostics and Control group booked record orders this quarter. We're seeing broad adoption of our Aera mask inspection tool for in-fab use, with repeat orders at DRAM and NAND customers as well as improved traction in foundry. In the advanced transistor area, we are seeing new epitaxy and CMP steps being added, combined with growth in PVD and CVD gate formation steps. In Services, we are seeing a minor reduction in semiconductor utilization rates, combined with wafer starts that are relatively flat, as capacity installed over the past 6 months is being absorbed. AGS [Applied Global Services] delivered a strong Q2, increasing their revenue by 8% quarter-on-quarter, led by growth in Semiconductor Services. AGS profitability is recovering as a result of improvements in our 200-millimeter equipment performance. In Display, TV shipments in the first calendar quarter increased 14% year-on-year, reaching 46 million units. This growth is below the level needed to increase capacity investments, and consequently, we are seeing some customers delay the build-out of their new factories.  Plans remain in place for all leading Display customers to build factories in China over the next 2 years. However, we are seeing equipment orders being pushed out of the fourth fiscal quarter to the first half of 2012. These delays in large-area TFT investments are being largely offset by demand for small- and medium-area panels for tablets and smartphones.  Investments in touch panel and low-temperature polysilicon for OLED and high-resolution LCDs is increasing. We now expect to generate over $300 million of revenue from these new applications in fiscal 2011. We are strengthening our market share position and our product portfolio in these areas.  This quarter, we released a new high-productivity PVD system for touch panels and a new Gen 5.5 CVD system for low-temperature polysilicon applications.  In Solar, panel demand for the first quarter was sluggish following 8 gigawatts of installation in the fourth quarter. Suspension and review of the feed-in tariff in Italy, which is currently the world's second-largest market for PV, resulted in uncertainty in inventory buildup in Europe. While resolution of the Italian feed-in tariff is a positive for the industry, the related delays lowers our full year forecast for installation to a range of 18 to 22 gigawatts.  For EES, this was an outstanding quarter, with both PWS [Precision Wafering Systems] and Baccini setting new records for revenue and profitability. Our wafering and cell customers are adding capacity as we see the leaders scale their factories for peak demand. We shipped over 6 gigawatts of nameplate -- of screen print capacity in the quarter, primarily to customers in China, as competition for higher efficiency at lower cost intensifies. PWS is gaining market share, secured by several large orders from key customers, underlining the B5's position as the industry's benchmark wire saw.  Orders and backlog remain healthy, and although we expect to see lower shipments in Q3, it will be another strong quarter for EES. We are monitoring capacity digestion, and we'll manage our supply chain accordingly. In summary, Q2 represented another very strong quarter for Applied Materials. Our strategic plans to gain share in our core businesses and grow our new businesses while driving greater efficiency and profitability remain firmly on track. In spite of near-term challenges in the macro environment, we believe 2011 will be an excellent year across all of our businesses.  Now let me hand the call over to George Davis for more comments on our performance and outlook. George?
George Davis: Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. We exceeded our target for net sales in the second quarter and delivered earnings per share at the high end of the range.  During the quarter, we also raised our dividend by 14% to $0.08 per share and generated operating cash flow of more than $700 million. These results demonstrate the positive impact of our operations and comp initiatives over the past few years, the strength of our products in the marketplace and the relatively strong market conditions experienced in the quarter, even as some customers began to adjust their spending plans in light of the economic challenges Mike discussed. I'll now compare our results to last quarter. Orders rose 7% to $3.2 billion, led by growth in Display and Silicon. Our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.1. Our backlog increased 10% to $3.9 billion. We're seeing some modest aging, but we expect about 80% of the backlog to turn in the second half of our fiscal year. Net sales increased 7% to $2.9 billion, with higher-than-expected sales in all segments except our Silicon Systems Group.  Non-GAAP gross margin of 41.9% was nearly one point lower, driven primarily by the higher mix of EES net sales. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $513 million and would have been $528 million excluding a nonrecurring benefit. We expect our third quarter OpEx to again be about $530 million, with a range of plus or minus $10 million. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was in line with our full year expectations at 27.9%.  Operating cash flow was very strong at $704 million, or 25% of sales. Cash flow benefited from higher revenue levels, strong working capital management and the front-end loaded payment structures for our Solar shipments. We returned $211 million to stockholders, repurchasing 8 million shares for $118 million and paying dividends of $93 million. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $4.6 billion, up $480 million.  We intend to fund the Varian acquisition with cash on hand in addition to short and long-term debt. The market for debt issuance remains attractive, and we may put long-term financing in place before the acquisition closes. We estimate the quarterly interest expense of funding the acquisition before the close to be about $0.01 per share, and this potential impact is included in our third quarter guidance. After the close, our near-term balance sheet focus will be to reduce short-term debt. On the regulatory front, the Varian transaction will require reviews in the U.S., as well as China, Taiwan, Israel, Germany and Korea. Most of the jurisdictions have an initial review or waiting period of approximately 30 days. The transaction must also be approved by Varian stockholders. Now I'll cover our operating segments. Silicon Systems Group orders grew 7%, led by our logic and flash customers. Foundry orders declined but still represented almost 50% of the order book. SSG net sales were 3% lower, driven by pushouts in foundry and a decline in logic that were partially offset by increased sales to DRAM and flash customers.  We now believe the second half will be softer than we expected at the Investor & Analyst meeting in March, with SSG net sales likely to be approximately flat with the first half. SSG operating margins declined, primarily as a result of higher operating expenses related to research and development around advanced transistors and from higher field resources.  AGS orders grew 9%, led by higher demand for 200-millimeter equipment. Net sales increased more than expected, rising 8%. 200-millimeter equipment deliveries and costs improved, driving the segment non-GAAP operating margin higher by approximately 4 points to 19%. However, the GAAP operating margin was flat sequentially due to a write-off related to an asset sale.  During the quarter, AGS agreed to divest its parts cleaning business, which had quarterly net sales of about $15 million. The pending sale triggered a $24 million impairment charge for intangible assets, which is excluded from non-GAAP performance. AGS is making good progress toward the plan to achieve operating model performance in the fourth fiscal quarter.  Display orders increased 80%, with over 70% of the total orders coming from new applications in touch panels, OLED and advanced mobile displays. Net sales were 7% higher, with over half of the sales occurring in China. Operating margins in the quarter increased slightly on the higher revenue. We believe the LCD TV display cycle bottomed in the first half of our fiscal year, and we expect our sales to strengthen during the second half. In EES, orders declined by 8% from the record levels seen in the first quarter. The slow pace of module installation in the first half of the year have led customers to examine the need for further capacity additions. And we are seeing softening demand as our customers adjust their spending plans. EES net sales were above expectations, rising 34% to a record $637 million. The non-GAAP operating margin was again very strong at 26%, reflecting the benefit of higher sales. China represented 76% of our solar equipment sales.  For the first six months of our fiscal year, EES operating profits were up by about $500 million year-over-year. This increase reflects the benefits of the restructuring actions we took in the third quarter of last year, as well as strong customer demand for our Baccini screen printing systems and our PWS wire saws. Next, let me talk about our business outlook. In general, our forecast for the second half of the year has moderated from our previous view of an increase in revenue led by semiconductor equipment demand.  We still expect to achieve record levels of revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share for our fiscal year. However, our earlier forecast of achieving more than $11 billion in revenue and $1.50 in non-GAAP earnings per share will require our fourth quarter to be sequentially higher than our projections for the third quarter. Achieving this outcome will depend on our customers seeing evidence of strengthening consumer demand over the next few months. I'll now share our outlook for the third quarter. In the Silicon Systems Group, we expect net sales to be flat to down 7%, reflecting a pullback in foundry spending. In AGS, we expect revenue to be in the range of flat to down 5%. In Display, we believe net sales will be up by more than 25%. In EES, we expect net sales to be down by 15% to 25% as customers digest the capacity additions of the past several quarters. We expect our overall net sales to be down in the range of 3% to 10%, or about $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion.  We expect our third quarter non-GAAP earnings to be between $0.31 and $0.37 per share. As a reminder, this range includes about $0.01 per share in potential interest expense related to financing the Varian acquisition before the close. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan: [Operator Instructions] Carrie, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Thanks for taking my question. George, in order for you to meet the prior full year outlook, you said that the demand has to improve and 4Q has to be up over 3Q. Which segments are important to be able for you to meet the prior forecast in 4Q? Is it going to be the Silicon business that has to inflect up?
George Davis: Yes. I mean, we always expected EES to be a little bit soft in the fourth quarter, so we're really dependent on a return to growth in SSG.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just follow-up, on the foundry side, you've seen the divergence at 65-nanometer utilization and leading-edge 40- and 28-nanometer utilization. More recently, there has been some chatter that the demand for the month of June has started to improve for foundries and utilization of leading-edge, and overall utilization is going to improve. Are the discussions with foundries pretty fluid at this point, and that's why that explains the range of the guidance?
Michael Splinter: Well, the discussions are pretty much along the lines that you just pointed out. 65-nanometer has been weak. There's some projection that it's going to come back and be more fully utilized in the next few months, but they're being cautious about that and focusing their investment on expanding capacity at the most advanced node, virtually at every foundry. But the 3 big foundries that have technology at 32 nanometers are really the one -- and below are really the ones pushing forward today.
Operator: Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: Thank you for taking my question. I just was hoping to, I guess, dig a little bit deeper on the Silicon side. You talked about Silicon revenues in the second half looking like the first half. And given the guidance down, I guess it would imply that you do expect Silicon revenues up in Q4. And so I guess the question is, am I interpreting that right? And is that what your backlog is telling you today?
George Davis: Yes, I think you're interpreting it correctly. In order for us to be flat, we have to be up modestly in SSG in the fourth quarter. And it's one of the reasons why we haven't walked away from the $11 billion and $1.50. It's certainly far more at risk than previously, but we think that there's still a chance that you'll see an increase in spending in our fourth fiscal quarter.
Michael Splinter: CJ, our view on wafer fab equipment spending has always been that first quarter and fourth quarter would be the biggest quarters on wafer fab equipment spending, with lower investment in Q2 and Q3 of the calendar year. And so that's kind of the way our fiscal year plays out. We have to have a pretty solid October to reach those numbers.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: That's helpful. Real quickly on LCD, can you share with us your view on CapEx including LTPS and touch panels? What your outlook is for calendar '11? And if you have early view on calendar '12?
Michael Splinter: We think that in calendar 2011, when you sum it all up, including touch panels and low-temperature polysilicon, it'd be down about 10% or 15%. We think, again in 2012, those areas are going to be -- the touch panel and high-performance displays are going to be very strong and grow. I think the big question is how quickly the China investments are going to take place. And if they go through in the first half of 2012, we're going to see a very strong 2012 in Display, and should be certainly a record for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my question. I have 2. Mike, your comment on the second half being flat. If you just targeted and assumed that your fiscal second half was similar to this calendar second half, would your confidence level be higher? Is it -- I mean, is it basically a matter of timing, or do you feel like the customer has still not come back to the table yet?
George Davis: I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear. Your voice cut out a little bit in the middle of that. Could you repeat that question again? I'm sorry.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Sorry about that. If you had to assume that your fiscal second half was similar to the calendar second half, would you feel more confident in your SSG business in calendar second half? In other words, are customers indicating they'll comeback in the second half, or are you just being more cautious?
George Davis: Yes, I think we think that as you get closer to year end, that things start to strengthen again, so that the pushouts start to come back in. Whether we can call that they'll come into our fourth fiscal quarter or into the fourth calendar quarter, I think it's a little premature.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then just a follow-up, just wanted to get a sense of what your customers are telling you or what is the feedback post your Varian acquisition announcement?
Michael Splinter: Sure. Overall, as you can imagine, we've talked to pretty much every customer that would be affected. And overall, the feedback has been quite positive. They see, as the industry matures and as their segments have consolidated, that the equipment segment needs some consolidation as well. So I would say on the whole, quite positive.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess on the foundry side, do you think the issue is more that the foundries are seeing weakening demand, or that they've already added a lot of capacity and they have a lot more coming? Or kind of, what do you think the breakdown is between those 2 dynamics that's causing them to soften up the orders a little bit?
Michael Splinter: Sure, Jim. Thanks for the question. I think the primary look is they're adding capacity at the leading edge, and the leading edge is fully subscribed. And it's fully subscribed at every one of the leading foundries. So I don't think there's a lot of play here, and that's where they're going to continue to focus their capacity growth. I think when you look at it, the dynamics of what's happened in the last few months, that a lot of the growth is focused on smart phones, which really demand 40 nanometers and beyond, 32-nanometer capability, to be able to satisfy the processing speed. Those things are going to be up something on the order close to 70% this year, I think even stronger than last year. So I think that's a big focus right now, along with tablets as a new category driving capacity. The new tablets require a lot bigger die, and again, driving towards the more advanced nodes. I think if there is a surprise for the foundry guys, it's that the subscription on 65 is lower than they would've thought. And that's where the pushouts in capacity adds are.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: That's helpful. If I could just ask a follow-up, and I afraid to ask the question. But I think what you guys are doing with the Varian acquisition is tremendous. It was really, really intelligent, and Varian's a phenomenal asset to be buying. But I guess we'll get the questions from customers, so we just we just want to ask you guys, is there anything about what's going on with the cycle that changes your willingness to acquire Varian and/or pay the price that the deal was consummated at?
Michael Splinter: Absolutely, we -- absolutely not. We're very excited about the Varian acquisition, Jim. You can see how the strategies line up between the 2 companies. The products are very complementary. We believe that there's complexity increase going on and investment intensity increasing in WFE. So all those things make this acquisition make tremendous sense for Applied Materials and for Varian. We're just been thinking about all the areas we can work together to enhance solutions for our customers, and think that's going to have a big positive impact over the next few years. George, you want to add anything on that?
George Davis: I would just add that when we look at acquisitions, and we've had, I think, a pretty good track record, we use pretty fundamental analysis, discounted cash flow. And I can tell you our models assume that we're still a cyclical business. And so there is an appreciation for the fact that you can't predict the cycles, but you can get a sense for valuation over time. And you really look at other ways that we can add value together. We've talked about the obvious areas, like synergies. But really, helping them take their foray into some of the markets where we're more experienced, like Solar and Display, can create value. And also, we think there's a lot of crossover then you start getting implant engineers together with some of our thermal engineers, and that some interesting things can come out of that. I think, also in the etch side, there's going to be some interesting products that come out of it. So there's a lot of areas where joint development is going to create, I think, solutions for customers that will create value for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: A couple of things. George, I'm just trying to bridge the gap between the bookings that you have in April and the revenue that you're guiding in July. It would suggest that there was at least a couple of hundred million dollars worth of pushouts in the Silicon business, or it would suggest that the bookings in July in the Silicon business will be down about 30% versus what they were in April. So I'm wondering if those numbers are right, number one. And then, number two, I had a question on margins in SSG. If you can help quantify, maybe, what some of the impact is from the Samsung settlement. Is that costing you a couple of hundred basis points worth of margins in that business?
George Davis: Tim, I think the first part of your analysis, which says there has to be pushouts, we've certainly seen pushouts, and that's part of the factor. But if you look at our backlog, you're still going to see 80% of that turn between this quarter and next quarter, and about 50% of it during this quarter. Also in the SSG side, as you know, we've been in a very high turns environment for the past 4 or 5 quarters. A little less so in this quarter. So some of the longer lead time customers are adding to the order book, so it doesn't necessarily turn in the first quarter, first quarter out. So those are factors. In terms of margins on SSG, I think clearly, the Samsung agreement has an impact. As we've said, relative to the overall model, we think over time, the downside case is that it takes a point off of the operating model. It's a little more front-end loaded when we first get started. But really, I think what you're seeing is more investment in TR&D opportunities that's impacting us in the near term.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: Just another follow-up question on that Silicon business, George. So with the backlog in Silicon growing 19% in the quarter, it does seem like the momentum is strong. So is it just a one-quarter pushout that you think might be being seen here in the industry? Is that why silicon sales might be up in the fourth quarter? Is that kind of the key read?
George Davis: Yes. I think that's -- I mean, I think that is a reasonable scenario for the second half of the year. We haven't put a forecast out for Q4, but that's certainly one of the outcomes that we could see as a reasonable outcome. But part of it's going to be you're going to have to see kind of a reversal of what we've seen for the last quarter, which is some of these consumer devices where we've had remarkably high growth rates quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year actually had negative growth in the last quarter. I think that's one of the things that really affected some of the foundry customers to pull back, as they weren't able to get through a lot of inventory. As you say, there are some signs that, that is going to be less of a factor going forward, but we've got to see the consumer demand side pick back up.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. And then Mike, can you share any early thoughts on 2012 in WFE? It looks like WFE 2011 was a little bit lower than originally expected. So can 2012 WFE be a bit higher than expected? Or is it still tracking kind of flattish, would you think?
Michael Splinter: Well, I think where we're at in 2012 is pretty much where we were at Analyst Day, $35 billion plus or minus a couple of billion. And the puts and takes, of course, haven't changed all that much, except I would say that some of these pushouts that may go into 2012 would actually strengthen our view at the current time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse. [Technical Difficulty]
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG: Back in this question on pushouts, so you mentioned that there was some economic-type reasons and demand weaknesses that were leading customers to pause and push out the equipment requirements on the logic, foundry side. I was wondering if there was any non-economic "strategic" sort of reasons where customers are unsure on large movement in market share, for example, that's causing customers to also take a little bit more time, in terms of capacity additions?
Michael Splinter: Specifically on market share. Market share is moving to those companies that have the most capacity at the leading edge. Obviously, there's a couple of those that have invested in capacity at the leading edge, certainly in foundry and logic. So I think you can see some movement in share, in particular, in this quarter. And then longer-term, it'll depend how fast the other foundry competitors get their capacity on line at 32 in particular, even 45 nanometers.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG: In planning the 450 millimeter, can you give us an update on where you stand on that? When do you expect to ship the first alpha to customers?
Michael Splinter: Well, as we certainly haven't established a ship date, there's a lot of work to do on 450 millimeter, to look at automation and chamber design and how we're going to approach it. So we still think that the production dates are in the 2015 to 2017 timeframe. We'll have to start investing more in 2012. But I don't think we're ready to publish a time when we're going to ship alpha tools. But it will be when customers need them.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have 2. First, Mike, is there any change in the memory customer, such as consolidation, that is having more of a structural impact on how much spending by memory-type customers are out there? And then just from a big picture, if I understand you correctly, the CapEx budget for this year has not changed, there is pushout, so doesn't that mean that the July or October quarter are going to be better than what you were expecting during the analyst event, because the CapEx budget have not changed given the pushouts?
George Davis: Why don't I take that second question first, Mehdi. The pushout, it just depends on whether it pushes 1 quarter or 2 quarters. And I think that will depend on, again, the economic factors out there. Everybody's reading the same tea leaves on this.
Michael Splinter: So from the memory standpoint, I still think by far the largest impact on memory investment, let's take DRAM first, is just the bit growth. We're kind of seeing bit growth in the 40% to 50% range, which really isn't enough to drive significant capacity. I do think that there can be difficulty in some of the smaller DRAM companies to get financing and have money available. But certainly, the big 3 DRAM companies have cash available and could invest in capacity if they need it. We do expect to see more investment in the second half in DRAM, but still very small on relative terms, comparing back to any of the recent peaks of wafer fab equipment spending. DRAM is less than 1/3 of where it was in those times. So I think this is more really about bit growth. In flash, I think it's more timing. I think in particular, the soft tablet growth in Q1 allowed some of the NAND guys to push out. But again, we expect them to come back in the second half and grow their investment. We also still expect NAND investment to be larger than DRAM this year. That view hasn't changed.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: I looked at Q-Manda [ph], it's out as DRAM out of Taiwan has marginalized. I looked at every presentation slide by the top memory manufacturers, they all talk about increased importance of return on invested capital and lower CapEx spending. So I look at all of those trends, and quite frankly, it kind of suggests less spending compared to previous cycles. So what gives the confidence that 40%, 50% bit growth is not enough?
Michael Splinter: Well, historically, it hasn't been enough to push capacity up, because moving generation node-to-node allows them to get significantly more productivity or more chips per wafer. And it just -- they have to have demand to be able to invest. I do agree that the smaller number of customers investing can have more discipline, and you can get less accentuated cycles, but in the end, it's a matter of supply and demand.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: Thanks for taking my question. So if I look at your prior full year guidance, obviously you're now reiterating it here. But if I look at the $1.50 earnings that you potentially can earn this year, and look at your midpoint of the third quarter guidance, that would imply a pretty big increase in earnings for the fourth quarter. Do you expect better margins in the coming quarters? And specifically, is that coming from just recovery on the SSG? Can you help me on that?
George Davis: Well, I think you'll see gross margin improve a little bit just on mix alone. We've also seen AGS had some margin issues this year related to 200-millimeter. We said they're pretty much through all of that by the fourth quarter, so we expect to get that benefit. But really, it's going to require SSG revenues to come back up. And as you know, that flows through at a very high rate. And so we'll just have to see how that plays out. But your analysis is correct.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: Great, very helpful. And then just maybe a little longer-term question. I think, Mike, in your prepared remarks, you talk about cell capacity, adding around 20 gigawatts this year. And it sounds like this is going to be a great year for Solar equipment. Just wondering how do you guys feel about the cycle? Are you worried that you look out 2012 that you might have a cycle pause in the solar equipment space?
Michael Splinter: We're monitoring what we think is effective capacity in our customer base. There a lot of things going on in the solar industry with share shifting and feed-in tariff reduction and then those who can really reach the cost necessary. You can see today that prices, cell prices, are coming down, spot prices are at $1, around $1. Poly prices are coming down quite dramatically to be able to fit into the envelope that these new feed-in tariffs are indicating. So at the same time, we're seeing the leading edge guys continue to invest in capacity because they want to be ahead on capacity, especially in a market where material costs are coming down, so that they don't have to have cells in inventory which are depreciating in value at a relatively fast pace. So in front of the feed-in tariff changes, we always see a pretty big surge in installations and deployment. And I don't think this year is going to be any different than that in the third quarter and then near the end of the year. So I think what we're seeing for capacity, kind of effective capacity going into 2012 is something around 40 gigawatts in the customer base. That's ahead of where we think installations will be, but that's true this year, too. And we are seeing pretty much record capacity expenditures in the solar field today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Mike, just the question again on your comment you said what happened in the second half. So if I look at second half flat from the first half on SSG, your revenue has to grow 9% in Q4. The question I have is that why do you need to see for that to happen? Are you expecting a specific -- the PC demand to improve or the handset demand to improve? Is it the foundries that have to order more, or the NAND? If you can give some more color on to what are the puts and takes that could drive that upside in Q4.
George Davis: Sure, this is George. Let me add a little color or add to that question here. Our view is that it just takes about one customer, with the amount of concentration that we have, that comes back, and just like the pushouts have been pretty concentrated, you could easily see 9% with an increase in foundry. You could see it -- NAND flash is certainly softer than we had anticipated in the second half of the year. There's a lot of reasons for that, but those reasons could also reverse themselves, the customers could have more confidence and we could see that in our fourth quarter. Those 2 alone could take us well above up 10% in the fourth quarter. But also, again, as Mike said, we're operating at a very low level of DRAM. And if customers start to see some firming in that kind of 3 strong quarters of down price for DRAM, you start to see a reversal in that, and people start to get a little more confident, you could see DRAM come back a little bit early. But I would say foundry and flash are probably the first place.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And then on the flat panel side, you said that you have seen some pushouts, but you see a big jump in revenue here. Going forward, do you basically see that flat line in the flat panel on the revenues?
Michael Splinter: No, what we said is we think we'll be up more than 25% in Q3 versus Q2. So I think the second half of the year is going to be much stronger. I think first and foremost, we're still seeing strong demand for touch panels and OLED. In fact, it's stronger than we had seen even last time. It's the large panel fabs, many of which are going to be built in China, that have been pushed out. So we may start to see orders for those in our fourth quarter, but maybe in the early part of '12. But in general, overall, we think spending will be up by a healthy amount in the second half.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just maybe a little more color in terms of the foundry pushouts that you've mentioned. Could some of those orders for 65 nanometers potentially convert to 40, 45 nanometers as they continue to add on back capacity? Since you also mentioned that they feel that they're still constrained on that front.
Michael Splinter: Yes, they certainly could. And while we haven't seen that yet, that would be a scenario for a strong Q4. If either 65-nanometer capacity comes back, or they up their investment at the leading edge nodes where capacity is much more constrained.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And maybe just a bigger picture question with Intel's recent announcement about the Tri-gate process technology and the layers involved there. Given your broad-based coverage across a lot of their -- across their production lines, where do you see the biggest incremental benefits? Specifically within Applied Materials, what process segments do you see incremental benefits from this transition?
Michael Splinter: Yes. Well, first of all, this is a new technique to make transistors. And I kind of alluded to it a bit in the prepared remarks. But we think that this technique, over a period of time, will be adopted, or a similar technique will be adopted to make high-performance transistors by all the logic makers. It just depends when they are able to put it into production. But it clearly lowers power and improves performance. So for us, I think one of the areas, of course, as we've moved to high-k/metal gate, PVD and CMP have been big beneficiaries. As we move into the next generations, we're going to see more epi steps, significantly more epi steps in the channel, as well as in the source/drain. And then plasma doping, because of the shape of these transistors, plasma doping, this is a structure that lends itself well to plasma doping. And we think that this will be one of those trends that really allows plasma doping to get into high-volume.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gus Richard with Piper Jaffray.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies: Thanks for taking my question. First [indiscernible] nanometer, 28 nanometer chips are coming out of the foundries. Any thoughts on sort of how those are ramping for your customers? And if yields are better than expected, worse than expected, how do you think that might impact your business over the next several quarters?
Michael Splinter: Well, I would just say that leading-edge is constrained today. I don't think we can really comment about our customers' specific performance, but I think the overall indicator when we check with our leading foundry customers, everyone is constrained on the leading-edge. And where there's -- so there's competition for capacity there. Are there sub rationales for why it's constrained? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but people are moving quickly to expand capacity there.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies: And then to follow on, having followed the industry for a long time, typically, when I've seen pushouts of this magnitude, they're usually followed by cancellations. Is there anything that gives you confidence that the next step isn't going to happen?
Michael Splinter: Gus, I didn't hear. "Followed by?" you broke up there.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies: I'm sorry, followed by cancellations.
Michael Splinter: Right. Yes, we really try to monitor the quality of our backlog, and George might want to comment. But at this point, we haven't seen any cancellations to speak of. If we would have, we would've mentioned it. And the big players in our backlog right now are not those that have historically canceled. George, do you want to comment?
George Davis: Yes. Right now, I think when you look at the aging of the backlog, it looks fine. And like I said, particularly with SSG, you've got -- over 50% of the backlog is going to go out in the next quarter, and you got 30% in the quarter after that. So right now, it looks healthy, but we always have the same concern that you have, which is you've got to watch this very closely and make sure that you balance everything from the way you look at your inventory to everything as you see this kind of behavior. But again, I think it really reflects the near-term economic conditions that Mike talked about. And we'll see if they worsen or things start to moderate and get better.
Michael Splinter: That's right, and Gus, I think we do have to see a return of growth in tablets in a significant way and those supply constraints come off, or we may have -- we may see other kinds of actions taken. But we're going to closely monitor this. I think we're still relatively optimistic about what's going to happen the rest of the year and the growth of the world economy, so -- and just popularity of the electronics devices we have in the market today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Thomas Diffely with D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: I was hoping to step back and just get your view of the PC cycle right now. And specifically, where you think we are in terms of a Windows 7 buildout or a refresh cycle, as well as some of these emerging markets over the next year or 2?
Michael Splinter: Well, I think that right now in PC cycle, we were not particularly encouraged that after Q1, sequentially down 10%. We think that emerging markets really are the key to growth in PCs, especially, in particular China, where we think that PC growth can be dramatic. And we need to see notebook growth return in a significant way. Right now, our estimates on PC growth for the year are between 6% and 10%. Earlier, we thought it would be more, greater than 10%, but after first quarter, we kind of tempered our view. I can certainly speak about Applied Materials moving to Windows 7. We're making the transition, and I have made the transition, and think that now is the right time for many corporations to do that. There's really a change in the way you can do computing across the company that Windows 7 enables. So it seems like the right time. I don't have good data on how the penetration is going. I'm sure our customers in Intel would have a better view.
Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. But when you look out at 2012, do think the emerging markets could, by themselves, drive a nice DRAM investment cycle? Or do you really need the domestic market coming back as well?
Michael Splinter: I think we need a strong PC market, overall. What we've said, and I think this is still true today, if PCs are growing 10% or 15% and smartphones continue their growth trend, we're going to see return of investment in the DRAM space. We think that would drive bit growth above 50% and necessitate pretty significant investment. While we haven't thought that DRAM investment would get back to its levels in 2006 and 2007, it's at such a discount today that we think it could double from today's levels and still be a prudent investment for the DRAM makers.
Operator: Your last question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: Mike, I just wanted to see if you can give us any idea of sort of what the concentration is of the $1.45 billion worth of SSG backlog. Is that -- I would think it's pretty heavily concentrated amongst a very small number of customers. I'm wondering if you could feel comfortable to give us any idea there. And lastly, since you were very intimately involved in the 300-millimeter transition when you were at Intel, I'm sort of wondering how, now that you're on the other side, given how much the equipment suppliers got burned during that shift, how you plan to sort of take what you learned from the chip side and make sure that you don't get burned this time from the tool side.
Michael Splinter: George, you want to comment on backlog, and then I'll comment on 450.
George Davis: Sure. Tim, as you know, some of the larger customers have been part of the reason for why you have high turns business on our orders. And so actually, the distribution of the orders is broader than you might think. It's not nearly as concentrated as our revenue is in the backlog and it really reflects the technology. A lot of is technology as well as capacity requirements of these customers. So the backlog is not over-weighted. You do have, obviously, a large logic presence there. And the foundries are certainly reflected, but at a much lower level than their overall share of the spending right now. Is that helpful for you?
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: It is. Yes, George.
Michael Splinter: I'd say a couple of things about the 450 transition that we're trying to look for in working with our customers. The first one is, is there a win-win window for both the suppliers and the customers, a space where they can get their cost reduction and we can still have a reasonable market that's going to grow over a period of time? The next one is the customers that are going to convert need to decide to convert on one node. One of the things -- and really aim the development at one node in technology. In the 300-millimeter, there was an initial fab at 250 nanometers. The real conversion didn't happen until -- really start in earnest until 130 nanometers. And then maybe the final thing I'd say is they really have to aim at a specific timing that we're going to really try to be able to stick through 2 despite cycles. Other thing that had happened in 300-millimeter is the transition got delayed several times because of the industry cycles. So those 3 things are topics that we're having serious discussions with the key players that are interested in 450.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thank you, Jim, for your question.  And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

We'll be sure to provide you with further details about the event over the next few weeks.  And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone on the call today. I'm pleased to report that Applied Materials started our 2011 fiscal year with a very solid first quarter. We posted revenue of $2.7 billion, generated $659 million of non-GAAP operating income and delivered earnings that exceeded the high end of our target. Orders were approximately $3 billion, backlog is building, and our outlook for the year as a whole is improving. For Applied, 2010 was a year of share gains and increasing profitability. We have carried this momentum into 2011. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our innovation engine. Last year, Applied ranked eighth in the U.S. and 33rd in the world for international PCT patent filings. I'd like to recognize our technologists and engineers for this noteworthy achievement. Let me now turn to the economic outlook. 2010 was a strong recovery year across the board, and 2011 is shaping up to be even better for our Semiconductor Service and Solar businesses. Since the start of the year, we have seen increasing optimism about the macro environment, although this is tempered with realism about risk factors, including inflation, political instability and unemployment. Strong demand for consumer electronics is being generated by innovative new products, and this is driving our Semiconductor and Display customers to invest in capacity and new technology. The market for smartphones grew 55% in 2010, and similar growth is forecast for 2011. We've seen the promise of the tablet market being realized, with 11 million units sold in the last three months of the year. There is an exciting lineup of new tablets ready for launch, and we expect sales to be in the range of 60 million to 70 million units this year.  The solar market exceeded our expectations in 2010, with over six gigawatts of PV modules installed in the last calendar quarter, bringing the total for the year to 17 gigawatts. We believe this robust growth will continue in 2011, and we anticipate panel installations to be in the range of 21 to 25 gigawatts. Germany and Italy are projected to make up over half of the market this year, while California and China are becoming increasingly significant. I'll now provide an update for each of our segments. In Semiconductor, smartphones and tablets are driving demand for mobile chipsets and solid-state storage, which translates to strong investments by our foundry, Logic and NAND customers. We maintain our view that PC growth will determine overall timing of the DRAM investment, and this remains the biggest swing factor in our WFE forecast. We believe DRAM prices have now bottomed out, and this is a positive sign for an eventual increase in spending.  Following recent announcements by our largest customers, we now see WFE spending for calendar 2011 in the range of $34 billion to $36 billion, an increase of 10% to 15% over 2010 and well above our previous view. We also see capital intensity increasing, particularly in foundry. As the foundries transition to advanced processes at 40 and 28 nanometers, their capital intensity will reach the highest level in 10 years.  Over the past two quarters, there has been a significant shift in the spending mix. Foundry and Logic are increasing as a percentage of overall WFE, with foundry projected to be close to 40% of the total spending in 2011. NAND investment will approach its previous high, while DRAM spending is expected to drop to less than 15% of WFE, its lowest level in over a decade. We believe we gained about two points of 300-millimeter WFE share in 2010, and we anticipate gaining at least another point of share in 2011 despite a mix that is slightly unfavorable to Applied.  Our gains in PDC are being fueled by customers' renewed investments in radical inspection, combined with net positional wins with our UVision Brightfield inspection tools at Logic and foundry customers. In etch, the adoption of our new Centris platform for double patterning and hardmask applications should help to offset an unfavorable mix effect and enable us to maintain market share following nearly four points of gain in 2010. In summary, our growth and profitability in SSG is being fueled by innovative products and strong customer relationships. We have a rich product pipeline and have planned to launch over 12 new products in 2011. We see momentum building as the year progresses. And based on the timing of customer investment plans, we expect our revenue to be second half loaded.  In Services, our market is growing, with wafer starts projected to increase in the range of 5% to 7% this year. AGS' growth was driven, primarily by our parts and services business, combined with strong demand for 200-millimeter tools. However, profitability was impacted by performance in our 200-millimeter equipment business. We have made a number of changes to our operations and organization. These are already having a positive impact, and we expect to see improvements in AGS' financial performance as the year progresses. In Display, while TV growth remains strong, with over 70 million units shipped in the final quarter of 2010, we expect CapEx for this segment to be down by approximately 30% in 2011, dropping to around $9 billion. However, this traditional downturn in LCD investment cycle is being partially offset by strong investment in new technologies as customers add capacity for touch panels and high-performance LCD and OLED displays used in tablets and smartphones. Applied has excellent share in both of these markets. And this year, we expect to generate more than $250 million of revenue from products that serve these new applications.  In Solar, as the industry scales, crystalline silicon module prices continue to fall, reaching spot prices as low as $1.50 per watt in calendar Q4. Our top customers remain profitable, are running their factories at full utilization and are increasing capacity. We are now projecting Crystalline Silicon CapEx for 2011 in the range of $7 billion to $9 billion, an increase of about 30% year-over-year. We expect 90% of this new capacity to be added in China and Taiwan. In the first quarter, our Solar business set new records for profitability. Baccini and PWS each shipped over 200 systems, more than the total number of units shipped in the first three quarters of 2010. Recently, our PWS group passed an important milestone by shipping their 2,000th wire saw. Crystalline Silicon bookings are at a record level, indicating another strong quarter of growth in Q2. Our visibility through the second half of the year is strengthening but is still limited. In summary, Applied began 2011 with a strong first quarter and growing momentum across the company. 2011 is shaping up to be an excellent year for all of our businesses. And based on our current view of the market, we expect to exceed $11 billion of revenue for the first time in our company's history. Our strategy is working effectively, resulting in share gains in our core businesses, growth in new businesses and greater efficiency and profitability.   Now let me hand the call over to George for further comments on our performance and outlook. George?
George Davis: Thank you, Mike, and let me add my welcome to everyone joining us on the call today. During our first quarter of 2011, Applied delivered earnings and net sales above the high end of our target ranges, led by our SSG and EES segments. Compared to our results from one year ago, net sales were up 45%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew more than 170%. This performance highlights the financial leverage in our business models and underpins the strong year-over-year earnings performance improvement we expect to see in 2011. Now I will review our results versus the prior quarter. Orders were down slightly, with significant growth in Solar, partially offsetting reductions in our other businesses. Backlog increased to $3.5 billion, a 9% increase. Net sales declined 7% to $2.7 billion, as record Crystalline Silicon sales partially offset the expected drop in thin film solar and display sales.  Non-GAAP gross margin of 43% was up slightly from last quarter, as improved EES margins more than offset lower margins in our other segments. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $486 million were better than our target range. This quarter included some onetime savings. And absent these items, expenses would have been at about the midpoint of our target range.  Next quarter, we expect OpEx will fall within the range of $510 million to $530 million, with the increases targeted for field support of Semiconductor customers and to address market share opportunities. These customers are investing aggressively to ramp technology and capacity and expect us to increase our support. This theme is expected to continue throughout the year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.36. GAAP earnings per share were $0.38 and included the benefit of an adjustment to our restructuring reserves and the R&D tax credit. Our tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% and included a two-point reduction to reflect the R&D tax credit adjustment. We expect our effective rate for 2011 will be in the range of 27% to 28%, about a five-point reduction from our rate in 2010. This improvement is primarily due to the implementation of our Singapore operations hub and Asia-based supply chain. Operating cash flow was $425 million or 16% of sales. We returned $243 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 11 million shares for $150 million and the payment of dividends of $93 million. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $4.1 billion, up over $200 million from last quarter.  I'll now comment on our operating segments. Silicon Systems Group orders were down 4% as DRAM bookings dropped nearly 40%, partially offset by higher foundry and flash demand. Three customers accounted for over 60% of SSG bookings this quarter, up from about 35% over the past two quarters.  Net sales were up a modest 1%, and margins declined by less than two points due to mix and the impact of a settlement. As a result of customers' increased capital spending announcements, we expect net sales of SSG will begin to ramp in our fiscal third quarter. AGS orders declined 13%, primarily due to lower demand for refurbished equipment. Net sales increased in line with higher wafer starts and some improvements in 200-millimeter equipment deliveries. Operating margins declined due to the continuing challenges in our 200-millimeter supply chain and the higher proportion of that business in AGS net sales. We expect to absorb the bulk of the remaining low-margin backlog in this quarter and see a return to more typical margins in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Display orders decreased 19% on lower demand for LCD equipment. Net sales were down 48%, reflecting the expected cyclical decline. Display operating margins were lower in line with the falloff in sales and the mix effect of sales into the OLED and touch screen markets. We expect our first and second fiscal quarters to represent the bottom of the cycle for the LCD market and that we will see a recovery in the second half of the year. In the EES segment, orders increased to a record $668 million, with new highs in the Baccini and PWS Solar businesses. Net sales declined less than expected to $476 million. Sales of crystalline solar equipment grew almost 30%, partially offsetting the large SunFab sign-off that occurred in the prior quarter.  Operating margin for the quarter of 30% reflected a favorable adjustment of $28 million related to the EES restructuring last year. The non-GAAP segment operating margin exceeded 25%. Margin performance in EES is well ahead of our model and reflects operating leverage on higher volumes, a concentration of Baccini sales and the benefits of our restructuring.  Next, let me talk about our expectations for the second quarter. We expect Silicon Systems Group net sales to be in line with the first quarter. AGS net sales are expected to grow about 3%, reflecting higher wafer starts. In Display, we believe net sales will be flat quarter-over-quarter. We expect EES net sales to be up at least 10% on strong demand from China, with a heavier mix of sales to wafering customers. Overall, we expect the company's second quarter net sales to be flat to up 5%, with shipment timing in Semiconductor and Solar as the biggest swing factors. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be between $0.34 and $0.38 per share.  Looking ahead, we see momentum building for our strongest year ever and now expect fiscal year non-GAAP earnings per share to exceed $1.50 at the $11 billion revenue level based on the market sizing Mike described. This would represent a 70% increase in our non-GAAP earnings per share on a 15% increase in revenue. We will provide more details about our full year financial outlook at our Investor and Analyst Meeting on March 23 from New York City. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, George. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Carrie, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs: This is Mark Delaney calling for Jim. Mike, I was wondering if you could start -- I know in prior quarters, you were more cautious that there could be potentially some excess supply building in the Crystalline Solar segment. I was wondering if you could give us an update behind what's making you more positive on the outlook for that area now.
Michael Splinter: Sure. Well, there's a number of things. If we just start with demand, if we look at Q4, we saw over 6 gigawatts of capacity, of module capacity being installed in the field in Q4. When you look at that on a run rate basis, that requires about 25 gigawatts of yearly capacity. We think, operationally, today, there is about 28 gigawatts that are really in effective production. So that means all the factories are full. That's why our major customers are seeing factories full, and that's why they're aggressively adding capacity. Still and now when you think about end demand for 2011, we think it's going to be very strong. As I said, we think Germany and Italy will lead the way, but there are just many other countries getting into the mix, not only in Europe but now throughout the rest of the world. Still, our visibility into the second half, while it's improving and I would say strengthening, it's still hard to see in this market the second half of the year. We have to see continued demand growth to justify the capacity. But today, there is not enough silicon, not enough wafering capacity to meet the demand that we expect to occur this year.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs: And George, a quick follow-up question for you. You talked about increasing OpEx for some targeted opportunities, wondering if this changes any of your longer-term plans on the cost reduction opportunities from the move to Singapore.
George Davis: No, it really doesn't change our plans. The move of activities out of our Singapore operations hub is a long-term commitment to, number one, first and foremost, meeting our customers' needs with the shortest possible cycle times. We have a largely Asia-based customer base now, and so there's a lot of reason to continue that. The spending is really more a function of opportunities. We wanted to build on our market share momentum in the semiconductor area. But also just the sheer volume of activity that we're seeing picking up with our customers, they're looking for us to help them. A lot of this activity is at the very leading edge. And so it's something that we need to do, and we think we'll have a very good return.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Number one, Mike, you hinted that the second half should be better than the first half. Is that across all your different segments? Or is it mostly Silicon and SPD? Can we expect EES/Solar to slowdown in fiscal second half?
Michael Splinter: Well, we do expect Silicon and Services and Display to have a better second half. I think the unknown is exactly what's going to happen in Q3 and Q4 in Solar. And as I said, our view is strengthening, but we still have to get some conviction. And we'll talk about it a little bit more in the Analyst Meeting at the end of March and give you an update of that time, but you essentially have it right.
George Davis: And Krish, think about it. We're running at almost a $2 billion a year run rate for Solar right now, which is almost 2x what we had forecasted at the beginning of the year. So we think the year is going to be better, but it's too early to say if it's going to be that good.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: And then a quick follow-up, George. I mean, you've done a fantastic job in the operational enhancement. Which innings are we in that? And how do we think about it going forward? Because given that you're shipping, at the same time you're trying to lower cost, where do you think the steady state OpEx should be at a $2.7 billion run rate for you guys?
George Davis: Krish, in the deeply cyclical business, there, it's very hard to get a single run rate. But the fact of the matter is we feel very good about where our cost structure is today and that the types of things that we're flexing are the things that you want to flex in response to opportunities, but we still have a very strong variable cost structure. And so we know that if we need to, we have the ability to flex the other way as well. In terms of kind of our what inning we're in, we have a continuous improvement mentality. So we don't believe in innings. We kind of -- you got to keep looking for opportunities to be more efficient and effective. And so I would say though, just to use your analogy, we're in the early innings still in our Singapore operations hub. So there's -- I think over the next five years, we'll see the full benefit of that, but our mentality about continuous improvement is intact.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: I wanted to follow up on how to think about the Silicon segment operating margin going forward. I was wondering if this negative impact in the January quarter from, I guess, the settlement with Samsung kind of onetime in nature, maybe from some pent-up demand from Samsung? Or is the Solar operating margin penalty kind of the right way to think about Silicon margins for the rest of 2011?
George Davis: Stephen, as we said, we think the effect of the settlement doesn't fundamentally pull us out of our business model for the Semiconductor business. Worst case, maybe one point. And quite frankly, I think what you're seeing is we came off of a very, very strong Q4. If you look over the last several quarters, this Q1 '11 would actually be the second strongest quarter they've had in multiple quarters in terms of operating margin. So I think we had a little bit of a mix issue compared to Q4, a little bit of impact of the settlement, but the business model's intact.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: And then maybe a follow-up question, Mike, for the Silicon market share gain goals. I know you gained two points last year, and you're thinking it could be one point this year. I know you said mix is having that impact. Is that just because DRAM customers are spending less this year, and that's where you got some strong share? Or is there more to that?
Michael Splinter: No more to it than that. We've been surprised how far down the DRAM orders and revenue have dropped and how fast they've dropped. We knew that DRAM wasn't going to spend as much, but it's running at a pretty low level right now. I don't want to make too big of a deal about that, but we're pretty confident about our share gain. With foundry spending, we're going to gain in PVD and CMP. And people at 28 nanometers now have to buy a new radical inspection equipment, and we've positioned our tools there very, very nicely. So I think those areas are going to provide the biggest pop on share gain in SSG.
Operator: Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: A question on the Display intensity. You talked about how the Semiconductor intensity is rising because of the foundries, and we've seen pretty large investments made by Apple and Qualcomm and other guys in the small to medium display panels and screens for smartphones and tablets. So I was wondering if you can talk about your dollar opportunity per unit of that CapEx. And as a follow-up, if you can talk about whether you would be willing do some kind of a joint venture with your customers in setting up a line or two.
Michael Splinter: So in Display, we kind of have this segmented in the more traditional TV market, where I commented investments will be down. Now there's almost like there's the new segment here with touch panels, with OLED and the high-performance LCD displays for tablets and smartphones. And what we're seeing this year is about a $500 million overall investment for that. We'll get -- our products will get more than half of that, actually probably more than 60% of that spending. We think that spending is going to continue and increase into next year as both volume goes up and more companies adopt these high-performance displays. We think there's really no choice there but to add on to it. As far as -- I think customers, especially the customers who need to invest in this space, are quite capable of supplying the dollars. I don't think that -- we want to supply to all of them, and I think it would not be a good idea at this point for us to JV with just one of them.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Arcuri with Citigroup.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: As it relates to your share, if I look at your WFE share, it was about 20%. If I sort of back into the numbers for calendar 2010, that's about flat with what it was the year prior despite probably there'll be some packaging revenues in there as well. So how would you expect your share to sort of shake out moving forward in the next few years? Because it doesn't appear like you're really gaining share yet in WFE.
Michael Splinter: Well, I think, Tim, if we look at our number for 2009, it was pretty close to 18-plus percent, and our number for '10 is 27%. So we can get off-line and get the details, so we can make sure we have the right numbers. And so just add another percent this year, but we think that this trend of one to two points a year can continue for a few years.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: And then Mike, just as I -- if you look at the bookings, if the second half of the fiscal year is or if the revenue for the fiscal year will be more second half loaded, that would seem to imply another strong bookings quarter in April, probably in the similar range. So if I sort of look at that, does that imply, given that you're sort of at a $12 billion bookings run rate and you're saying that revenue for the year will be $11-plus billion, does that sort of imply that bookings have topped out here? Or do you think, as you kind of look at how all the business mix together, that bookings can still go higher here throughout the rest of the year?
George Davis: Tim, it's George. Why don't I take a shot at that. Our view is we're clearly seeing very strong bookings for the Solar business right now. We expect orders to pick up for our Semiconductor customers throughout the year. In Display, we're still at the cyclical bottom, so we ought to see some improvement there as well. And I would expect AGS to be a little bit more ratable going forward. So I think those elements would drive you to have on order outlook that's in line with a stronger second half. And that's on top of, as you know, an environment where DRAM orders are just dropping significantly.
Operator: Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: I guess if you look at Silicon coming in back-end loaded and then Service improving through the year and LCD at a cyclical trough and I guess uncertainty around EES, can we assume -- or can you help us here in terms of the operating margin? It would appear that we should see at least 200, 300 bps of improvement through the year. Is that the right way to think about it?
George Davis: I think if you take a look at our published models for operating margin, that's consistent with that. And you would also expect to see that with a strong SSG second half.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: And then I guess real quickly, as a follow-up, in terms of the variance and the $34 billion, $36 billion WFE guide, what would drive the uptick there? Would that be a resumption from DRAM? Or is that still more foundry and logic based?
Michael Splinter: I think it can be -- the biggest thing is, we said, was DRAM, because it's at such a low level. And whether it comes back in the second half of the year or the beginning of 2012, it makes me have more confidence in the length of this cycle. When you look at what memory is as a percent of WFE right now, it's around 30%. Back in '07, at the previous peak, it was 70%. So there's a lot of, now, and spending was roughly at the same levels, overall. So I think there's a lot of room to move in the memory area, but of course, we got to see a strong PC growth to warrant that. But I'm encouraged, because I expected prices to kind of -- DRAM prices to hit bottom around June, to hit bottom in January, starting to strengthen already. So I think that's a good omen for late-in-the-year investments in DRAM.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: First question on the Solar side. Can you remind us what's your lead time right now and remind us if your lead time is still pretty long? If that's the case, will you have some visibility in the back half?
George Davis: Edwin, the lead time is still about four to six months for our equipment, and the factories are pretty much all full out.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: With that kind of lead times, you should have restart focusing some of the stuff in the second half. Wouldn't that be the case?
George Davis: That's part of it, and we have backlog today of about $1 billion in EES already. So you've got healthy backlog. And the things that we'll be shipping in Q2, we've been working on for a period of time already, and much of it's already secured by LC. So this is a -- it's a pretty straightforward market in terms of linking all those elements.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: And just a quick follow-up on Display. You mentioned $250 million of revenue in new applications. Is that on top of the 30% capital spending decline that you expect for the industry? And are those mostly come from PC? Or did some of that come from PVD?
Michael Splinter: Yes, that's on top of the 30% decline. Now we're trying to separate the TV market from the new applications market. It's web coaters primarily.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: First off, in terms of your last comment about the solar capacity that you have been in-house being, I guess, all full out right now, how much do you believe you need to add to your own internal capacity to meet both existing as well as the future demand?
George Davis: I think we feel good about where the capacity is today. I mean, if we can meet this quarter, I think that will be a good stress test. And so we're confident we can support the quarter, and we'll just see how the second half of the year plays out.
Michael Splinter: And our teams have been very good at quickly adjusting capacity. If you think back to the first part of 2010, we were delivering 1/3 of these volumes. So the team has responded very, very quickly, so our supply chain here is pretty flexible.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And I know you guys have talked about this in the past as a growing area for your Silicon Systems business on the advanced wafer-level packaging. And can you just describe where we are on that front and whether that's a driver for some of the share gains you're looking for in 2011?
Michael Splinter: It will be a small driver of share gains in 2011. We really expect production volumes in 2012. We have estimated 2012, it'd be about a $500 million market, much smaller than that in 2011, but we have very high share of the total.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Arete Research.
Jagadish Iyer - Arete Research Services LLP: First, I just wanted to find out on the trajectory of the Display margins, given that you have these two new product lines, which are going to be contributing about $250 million. So I just would like to know about the trajectory of the operating margins.
George Davis: The OLED and touch panel equipment is, quite frankly, older-generation equipment for us. So it has and has been really outside of the commercial arena for a few years now. So it hasn't gone through the supply chain actions that we've taken on our core and active products that have improved the margins over time and really meet the Display model. As this market develops, we will do that, and the margins on this equipment will look a lot like the Display margins overall. So we'll talk at the March meeting. We'll go into the business models going forward, but it won't be a material change in the business model for Display.
Jagadish Iyer - Arete Research Services LLP: Just a follow-up, Mike, on your thoughts on the NAND spending. Do you believe that it will continue to grow in 2012? And if so, if DRAM also comes back, do you think 2012 could be a blockbuster year for memory spending?
Michael Splinter: I'm not going to ask you to define blockbuster, but I do think NAND spending has to continue to increase. And part of this assumption, of course, is that NAND density and tablets is going to continue to go up double, essentially, year-on-year and then tablets will double again in 2012. So I think NAND spending has to continue to go up from here. DRAM has to come back. Whether that results in a blockbuster or not, I have no idea. But it's going to be positive -- the second half of the year and into 2012, I believe, will be very positive for memory.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gus Richard with Piper Jaffray.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies: George, just help me out as I model going forward. What's the range of gross margins -- understanding that there's a mix component to that, what would you expect that to be over the next year and a half?
George Davis: Yes, I think you've seen the range. What we're seeing, for instance, in this quarter, while it was a flat, there was a lot going on. And if you look at the kinds of things that we're -- the potential mix effects as we get a recovery in Display, that helps lift our overall gross margins. But as we get a higher mix of Solar, it has lower gross margins than kind of our average margin as a company, even though, as you've seen, the operating performance was just outstanding this quarter. So a very strong Solar is a good story, but it will bring down our average gross margin a little bit. We don't see any fundamental change to the gross margin structure of our Semiconductor business. And AGS, which has struggled in the first couple of quarters of this year will improve in the second half. So I expect, overall, the second half will be a stronger gross margin period for the company. But any time you have a large load of Solar, that will dilute it a little bit. But again, the profitability there is far more attractive so...
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies: So we can kind of think about 42% to 45% gross margin range sort of where you'll operate going forward?
George Davis: Sure, I think that's a reasonable range. You can widen it out, or 41% to 45% is probably okay.
Auguste Richard - Piper Jaffray Companies: And then Mike, just looking at the PC market, I mean, it appears to me we're getting a shift to smartphones and tablets. That's a lot of high leading-edge low-marking silicon that probably drives a lot of consumption. What are you thinking about PC unit growth going forward this year? And where would it become a problem in terms of your thoughts of over $11 billion this year?
Michael Splinter: We're still thinking 10% or greater PC growth this year, driven a lot by emerging markets and corporate. And so I think that's still a pretty positive view about PCs, and I think it will drive more DRAM investment. Where could it get where it starts to have problems with our model? I can't really quite say, because I think the big part of the swing here is what would happen at Intel if the numbers went down dramatically. So I think they're pretty committed to their capacity expansion, and they have a pretty clear view of their market.
Michael Sullivan: And Carrie, we have time for about two more questions please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Pang with Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company: First, on the market share that you commented on for the SSG. I would have assumed that you guys would actually gain some share since a lot of the foundry applications are in these newer technology nodes. Am I misunderstanding what you guys are talking about in terms of the shift that's causing the market share slower momentum I guess?
Michael Splinter: Foundry is good. We put foundry and Logic together. It's good for Applied Materials. The modest headwind I talked about was just the drop-off in DRAM and rise in NAND. There's a lot of shifting around. As I said, I don't want to make too big of a deal out of that. But when we talk about market share, we're talking about market share in overall WFE for a 300-millimeter WFE not just in our SAM. In our specific product groups, we will obviously gain more, because we address only about half the overall TAM in the market.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company: And a bigger picture question, when you think about DRAM capital intensity, you commented on some prior historic low values and high values for capital intensity. In general, does the amount of on-chip memory now kind of change those capital intensity historical -- the way we'd look at it historically?
Michael Splinter: You want to repeat the last part of that question?
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company: Well, now that Intel has so much memory on it's own chip, right? How do we actually think about the way that memory -- the way that that Logic actually drives memory spending? Can we actually compare it to like 1995?
Michael Splinter: Well, it's really about addressable memory in a PC, and so that's kind of gone over the last five years from 2 gigabytes per PC to -- we actually saw a drop-off last year as prices went up, and now it seems to be trending up to almost 4 gigabytes per PC. We expect 3.9 gigabytes per PC in '11, up from about 3 gigabytes in 2010. So how that DRAM is attached hasn't really changed in PC architecture in recent times.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: George, what percentage of AGS is attributed to SSG sales?
George Davis: SSG for AGS is 80-plus percent of their overall. I mean, the Semiconductor related for AGS. Is that your question?
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Yes, exactly.
George Davis: 80-plus percent.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Mike, in the past, you have spoken about a whole new like roughly, like $60 billion spend for all the new fabs that are coming online now over the next 12 to 18 months. Where do you think beyond that -- like how much is being spent? And how much more is there to go?
Michael Splinter: Well, we keep updating this chart. Now we're tracking 18 fabs. And over the next eight to 12 quarters, I think we're estimating that there's $80 billion of potential spend there. So some has come off. Some have come on. The net-net has increased quite dramatically. I don't have the exact puts and takes in front of me, but I think that's close to the net-net.
Michael Sullivan: And then Carrie, do we have a last question please.
Operator: Your last question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Farhan Rizvi: This is Farhan calling in for Satya. My question is on your edge market share. Can you talk about like your edge? And especially like your new product, how's the traction with that? And how do you see it going into 2011 and 2012?
Michael Splinter: Sure. So if we take a step back, last year, we believe our edge share was up about four points. A lot of that was in memory, where silicon edge in particular is increasingly favorable for us with varied word lines and debt lines. That's really a quite positive aspect for us. We've been gaining share in both NAND and foundry. Recently, we talked about our new platform, but are really trying to focus in on patterning and edging hardmask and helping with the double patterning definition. These things, this year, since I think is -- you know that we have some headwind this year with the foundry spending higher, DRAM spending lower, and we don't have that share at Intel. We believe that the gains that we're going to make will allow us to hold flat share in '11. So as memory spending comes back, we think it will be very positive for us. And inside of that, our intrinsic application share is growing.
Farhan Rizvi: Just one more question on capital intensity for foundries. The foundry spending is up quite significantly, and I just want to see what your views are on CapEx. Do you see that the increasing complexity is increasing the CapEx for you?
Michael Splinter: I do. I think that what's happening right now as I look at trying to develop the 28- and the 22-nanometer technologies, the capital per wafer start is going up quite dramatically. I think it will be very close to the Logic capital per wafer start at those nodes. In the past, foundries have had a pretty very significant advantage on capital per wafer start. We see that going away as the high-k/metal gate approaches, and the processes just get a lot more complex. So we're certainly seeing that this year and capital spending per dollar of revenue, and we think that's going to continue in the advanced nodes.
Michael Sullivan: And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. A replay of this call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. We hope to see many of you at our Analyst Meeting next month, and we'd like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Marcelo, and good afternoon. Joining me today are: Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Sweeney, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.  Today, we'll discuss our results for our second quarter, which ended on May 2. Our earnings release was issued at 1:05 p.m. Pacific Time, and you can find a copy on Business Wire and on our website at amat.com. Mike Splinter will be off the call with comments on our business environment, performance and strategies; George will follow with a look at our financial performance for the second quarter, along with our expectations for Q3. We'll then open the call for your questions. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael Splinter: Thanks, Mike, and welcome to today's call. Let me start by saying it feels much better to be talking about this year's second quarter than it did just a year ago, while we were experiencing the bottom of the downturn and the global economic recession. Our employees have done a terrific job responding to the challenge of the steep ramp over the last three quarters, and our results reflect their commitment to excellence. Our customers are responding to growing demand for consumer electronics in emerging markets. And after a long period of underinvestment by our semiconductor and display customers, we now see a multi-year up cycle in both industries. This improved outlook has given us the confidence to increase our cash dividend and resume our stock buyback program. We generated strong results in Q2 led by our Silicon Systems Group, which grew sales by over 40%, well above our expectations. The Display business also exceeded our goals for sales and profitability. We saw a quarter-over-quarter sales growth and profit improvement across all of our major businesses except for thin film solar, where we are taking decisive steps to realign the business with a lower market output.  I'll now comment on each of our businesses and the markets they serve. In Silicon, we are again raising our wafer fab equipment spending projection to a new range of $26 billion to $28 billion for the calendar year. This new estimate is $5 billion higher than our forecast just three months ago. We also have increased confidence that we are in a multi-year up cycle that began three quarters ago. We are now tracking 11 new fabs and fab expansions, which alone would support $35 billion to $40 billion of WFE spending over the next six to eight quarters. Our customers now have higher confidence in the cycle. And their focus is shifted with more than half of overall spending now targeted at capacity additions. We're also seeing spending from a broader base of our foundry and memory customers. We have ongoing strength from foundry and DRAM this quarter. And the supply of advanced memory has remained tight with prices holding firm.  The initial success of the Apple iPad is a good leading indicator that tablet computers are emerging as a major new category and then driver of NAND flash capacity. In fact, we believe that incremental demand for iPads and smartphones will absorb about 60% of the new NAND capacity coming online in 2011.  As we said at our Analyst Meeting, our goal is to gain share in the recovery, and third-party market research released this quarter shows that we are well on track. Applied gain more than two points of WFE share in calendar '09, more than any of the other top 10 suppliers.  The addition of Semitool to our advanced packaging lineup has also given us the number one position in this fast growing market. Growth in advanced packaging is outpacing WFE, and we are the only equipment supplier to have a full suite of products for this market. Applied is on track to gain another two points of WFE share in 2010, which should bring our total share above our 2006 peak. In Etch, our sales in this quarter alone were equivalent to all of our sales last fiscal year. Moving to Display. The industry is seeing strong demand for flats panel TVs and notebooks, particularly in China, where consumer demand for flat panels is outgrowing the U.S. market. High factory utilization of about 95% is leading our customers to invest in new capacity. We expect the current Display cycle to be broader and longer than previous cycles, with the first lag consisting of orders from major customers in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. And the second lag driven primarily by new factories in China based on Gen 7.5 and Gen 8 technology.  We are raising our industry forecast for Display equipment spending to be up by more than 70% from calendar '09. I'm proud with the solid profitability achieved by our Display business this quarter during the demanding ramp. And in PiVot PVD, we recently secured repeat orders at a leading flat panel customer, while achieving sign offs at our third customer sign. In solar, total industry PV installations have accelerated and are now expected to be in the range of eight to 10 gigawatts for the year, and module prices have stabilized. Capacity additions are also trending higher with 10 to 12 gigawatts expected in 2010, driven primarily by customers in China. While demand signals for crystalline silicon equipment remains strong in the near term, we are closely watching the longer-term capital spending outlook, given the growing potential for overcapacity, the changing value of the euro and uncertainty about future European incentives. This year, over half of all solar panels will be made in China and Applied is favorably exposed in this opportunity. Q2 was our highest-ever quarter for crystalline silicon bookings, which was led by our Baccini Cell Systems, and we expect to gain several points of metallization share this year.  We're seeing strong demand for our new Baccini Esatto system with double-printing technology that boosts sale efficiency by up to a half a point. We shipped a gigawatt of nameplate capacity in Esatto systems this quarter, and we expect to increase that run rate by an additional 50% during Q3. We're managing a steep ramp in our Wire Saw business, while closely monitoring the demand from a concentrated customer base. Turning to thin film. The second quarter was very difficult in all respects. A large customer filed for insolvency, a major new customer failed to secure financing and several other customers experienced weaker outlooks and reduced their spending plans. These events have significantly reduced our thin film solar revenue expectations for the year and lowered our demand forecast for new factories. As a result, our thin film performance for 2010 will be well below expectations, and we now expect that EES will not meet its goal to achieve break even for the year on a non-GAAP basis. We have viewed break even is an important milestone for EES that would contribute a substantial improvement to our company's profitability. Since the goal is no longer achievable, I've asked our team to develop a plan that will accelerate reductions in our thin film cost structure beyond the levels we discussed at our recent Analyst Meeting.  These reductions will bring our costs in line with a lower demand profile, while allowing Applied to meet our commitments to existing customers. I expect the plan to be finalized by the middle of June, and I expect EES to make a positive contribution to our company's financial performance in fiscal 2011. Going forward, we will continue to sell some fabs, but only where we see an acceptable return on investment. Our confidence in the long-term potential of the thin film solar market remains high, and we know that Applied has the technology and people needed to drive excellence excellent solutions. However, we must have a business that stands on its own. In closing, Q2 was an exciting quarter for Applied Materials, with a significant ramp and a bright outlook for our Silicon, Display and Crystalline Silicon Solar businesses. At the same time, we are taking decisive action to address the shortfall in demand for our thin film solar equipment.  I'll now hand the call over to George Davis for more details on our financial results and targets. George?
George Davis: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Applied delivered financial results in the upper end of our target ranges for both net sales and earnings per share, with strong operating performance in our Silicon and Display groups. Order growth was 29% quarter-over-quarter with better-than-expected increases in Silicon and EES. Net sales were up 24% led by better-than-expected Silicon growth. Non-GAAP net income was $292 million or $0.22 per share. This performance included the impact of an operating loss of $145 million in our EES segment, which I will discuss in a few minutes. Before covering our sequential results in detail, I want to share a few comparisons with the second quarter of 2009. Compared to our results from one year ago, orders increased 290% and net sales grew by 125%. Non-GAAP net income in the quarter was up over $450 million from the loss position of a year ago, increasing earnings per share by $0.34. These numbers showed just how difficult 2009 was for our businesses and how rapidly demand for our products has ramped in 2010. Now I will return to sequential comparisons of our results. Gross margin increased almost two points from Q1 of this year, reaching 40.4%, driven by higher net sales in our most profitable business segments. This improvement included the impact of an $83 million inventory charge relating to thin film solar, which lower gross margin by 3.6 points. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $527 million were within our targeted range. We still expect quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to remain between $520 million and $540 million through the end of the fiscal year. We opened our new manufacturing and logistics center in Singapore this quarter and expanded production in our display facility in Tainan, bringing our operations closer to more of our customers. Throughout our transition to these new sites, we are meeting the steep ramps in our Silicon and Display businesses.  The consolidation of worldwide operations is a critical element of our long-term productivity program. The operations group has 2,500 employees worldwide, supporting 17 manufacturing centers in eight countries. With approximately $4 billion in annual receipts, we expect that our initiatives in these areas will yield tangible cost improvements across all of our businesses. Backlog increased slightly to $3 billion, reflecting a healthy order book across all of our segments. Backlog adjustments were negative and totaled $184 million driven by cancellations, debookings and currency adjustments, primarily within EES.  Operating cash flow performance for the quarter was very healthy, reaching 23% of sales or $527 million. Strong working capital management resulted in record low days sales outstanding, and only a modest increase in inventory despite a significant increase in our net sales. Our cash flow also benefited from a tax refund of approximately $130 million related to 2009 operating losses.  We announced a 17% increase in the dividend earlier this quarter and resumed our share buyback program, requiring 7.6 million shares in the quarter. Total cash used for repurchases and dividends in Q2 was $181 million, and we added $365 million to our cash and investment portfolio, which ended the quarter at approximately $3.6 billion. Now turning to the segments. Silicon orders increased 25% from Q1 led by memory and logic customers. Customer lead times remain short with over 65% of silicon sales coming from orders received within the quarter. Our supply chain was able to respond to the increased demand despite short lead times, global air traffic delays and transitions to the new manufacturing site.  Net sales were much higher than expected, growing 45% quarter-over-quarter. We are seeing a broadening of customers spending with approximately 60% of sales expected to come from five to six customers in the second half of this year, compared to only three in the first half of the year. With the higher forecast for wafer fab equipment spending, our improving market share position and the addition of Semitool, we expect to significantly exceed the net sales growth target for silicon that we provided at our recent Analyst Meeting. We are well into our integration process with Semitool and expect to achieve GAAP accretion early in fiscal 2011. Applied Global Services orders were approximately 2% higher than in Q1, net sales grew 7% and operating margin increased almost five points to just below 20%. Spares availability, along with our performance to customer delivery goals, improved significantly during the quarter.  Display delivered an exceptional quarter. Orders increased over 100% driven by customer investments in China, sales also more than doubled and operating margin increased 14 points to 33%, reflecting strong flow through and a favorable product mix. During the quarter, the Display team made significant progress toward completing the volume manufacturing transition to our new facility in Taiwan.  EES reported a segment loss of $145 million, primarily driven by losses in our Thin Film Solar business. Challenging market conditions, associated with the growing supply of low-cost crystalline silicon panels and a limited expansion of utility-scale opportunities, are impacting demand from our current and prospective customers. The inventory charge, the impact of a major customer insolvency and diminished demand overall will result in EES posting a non-GAAP operating loss for the year. We are committed to taking the necessary actions for EES to reach profitability in 2011. Moving to the outlook for our third fiscal quarter, we see continuing strength in our most profitable businesses. We expect silicon net sales will be roughly in line with a very strong Q2 levels. AGS net sales were expected to increase in line with wafer starts and higher used equipment demand.  Display expects another solid quarter, but we expect net sales to be down at least 20% below a very strong Q2. We expect EES net sales to be up by more than 25%, primarily as a result of higher crystalline silicon sales.  With that segment mix, we expect the company's overall net sales in Q3 to be in the range of down 2% to up 5%. We also expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings per share to be between $0.22 and $0.26 per share. This forecast does not include any potential charges related to EES restructuring, as a plan for that is being developed and will not be completed until later in this quarter. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, George. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow up. Marcelo, let's please begin.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I guess maybe as a start on the Silicon business and look at the composition of orders this quarter. I think press release said about 10% of the orders were from flash. Obviously, there's been some good recent announcements from customers there. What percent of orders do you think would be made up by flash maybe in the next fiscal quarter and then maybe in the back half of the calendar year? That would be the first part of the question. Then, I guess, maybe my follow up would be, how much of the increase in wafer fab equipment expectation for the year relative to the forecast from the analyst meeting is due to a single customer versus a more broad increase in expectations from the customer base?
Michael Splinter: On flash, first of all, I would say, the bookings trend, our projection for the next quarter is quite strong, but off a pretty small base. We think flash orders will be up about 50% in the quarter. We're having a lot of turns business as George talked about, so it could vary a little bit depending on where the turns business comes from in the quarter. We expect that to continue to strengthen through the rest of the year. Then to the second part of your question on, is our increase in projection all due to one customer? No, we're thinking that actually from our last quarter outlook that there's a broader base of spending that's happening as confidence grows across the customer base.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: If I annualized the April quarter silicon bookings for 2010, we get something in bookings up about 115% year-over-year in calendar '10, and that looks like, Mike, your new WFE outlook is up about 100%. So my question is, do you think Applied's higher silicon bookings from greater [ph] (27.37) function of better exposure in memory customers or share gains, or is there something else there? Then my follow-up question is on the July Display sales guidance, that's down 20% sequentially. Is that simply because the flat panel bookings take longer to turn into revenue?
Michael Splinter: But on the bookings for the year, I think there's a couple of factors just how different companies recognize things, but we think that we will gain share. Won't account for 15% or 20% or some number like that in difference between us and others. So I think we're more confident about our share gain and I think you can factor that into the number. I think other things have to be on timing and how orders are received from customers. On the flat panel display, it's just a lumpy business and I think the market is strengthening. We're very -- and actually, the way the cycle is going in flat panel display is, it's broadening. And quite different than the last cycle where there was just a rush to buy capacity in one quarter, I think our orders went up to 500 million in one quarter, we're seeing a much broader and stronger effect that's going on right now as different customers are in different places. And then, who's going to actually get the build in China and who's not. I think those factors are all playing into the flat panel display order and revenue trends. But I would say that, that market is strong and literally, as strong as I've seen at any time. George?
George Davis: I would agree, Mike. I wouldn't view the fact that we see Display down as a trend point. It's really more a function of the lumpiness of the business. It's still -- even down 20% would be a very strong quarter by any measure, and we expect it to continue to show strength over the next several quarters.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: The first one is, what is your order outlook overall for the July quarter, as well as if you could provide by segment, that'd be very helpful. And then the second part of the question is on the OpEx front. Looks like you had some pretty good savings there. I'm curious what kind of absolute run rate you projected there for both the July and September quarters?
George Davis: On the order outlook, we're not giving order guidance. I think the way I would think about our orders is obviously, our quarter, we got a month off of the calendar quarter, so our order book, if you try and make comparisons to competitors, you got to adjust for the lag. We think orders, again, particularly since we've been working on such a turns basis and SSG will be hard to forecast with a lot of accuracy. If you step back and say, "What do we really seeing here?" We're seeing a multi-year cycle in our view in both semiconductors and display. We expect orders will reflect that. We expect to continue to gain share and actually in both of those markets, so we're quite positive. It's not a lack of optimism that is keeping us from guiding orders. In terms of OpEx, I think what you saw in terms of saving this quarter was really the absence of restructuring cost that took place. If you look at non-GAAP OpEx, which is really what we've been guiding to, is we were up about $50 million. All of it can be explained by the addition of Semitool into our financials and increase in variable comp in line with the increase in revenue. So I think the $520 million to $540 million range for non-GAAP OpEx is the right range.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: George, if I look at your silicon revenue guidance flat and given that the turns business is still quite high, is it fair to assume silicon orders will be flat to down for Applied?
George Davis: Again, I don't really want to -- we won't really forecast orders. But I think we should see very strong both revenue and orders in the quarter, whether it'll be up or down marginally will be a function of individual -- it's pretty concentrated, as well as pretty short term. So I would put any movements around the edges just a function of timing. We still see multiple quarters of strong demand coming in that area.
Michael Splinter: One thing I'd add, Atif, is that our operations group right now is in certainly much better shape. The supply chain has kind of got itself healed quite a bit from the blows it took last year during the downturn. So our ability to respond to turns business is much better than it was even a few months ago.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: One follow up on the EES business. Your comments that on some SunFab projects, the return on investment can make sense. Can you provide some more color on the scale of those projects? And are there currently any projects of that size on regions like China or India where the return on investment does make sense right now?
Michael Splinter: There is actually a number of different kinds of projects that make sense. Certainly, large projects, with the likes of utility companies in China or major companies in India, where it makes sense. We're certainly having discussions with a number of those companies. But also upgrades, both capacity expansions and tandem junction upgrades make very good sense and have excellent ROIs for us in the business. So you can imagine that we're having those discussions with those customers.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Tim Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: First of all, George, I think you said six months ago that of the backlog, roughly $650 million was SunFab. And I think, probably most of your cancels were in SunFab. So is it right to think that of the backlog right now, maybe $400 million is thin film related?
George Davis: In our backlog?
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: Yes.
George Davis: Yes, that's a reasonable approximation.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: And secondly, Mike, can you give us some idea of sort of the breadth of the silicon customer base? It still sounds very narrow. And I'm sort of wondering if you can give us some data around how that might be broadening out or not broadening out, and how you might think that might change, going forward? If it is going to be a multi-year cycle, it would seem that, that would be needed.
Michael Splinter: I agree, it's certainly needed. And even as it broadens out, it's still narrower than has been in the past. But maybe one comment that I think is illustrative is if we just look at foundry bookings and kind of how we're thinking about it quarter-over-quarter, I think I said earlier, I think those will remain flat. And I think you know that there's a shift there in the ordering from different foundry customers. And that's the kind of positive shifts of broadening out that we're seeing, and surprising strength among the other customers beyond just the leader in that group. And I think we could say that in DRAM as well. And we really haven't seen much from flash yet for the second half of the year. So on a real magnitude basis, flash has still been small, and my belief is that supply is very tight. Those factories are running flat out. And I think we're going to see some significant expansion as we go through the second half of the calendar year.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Satya Kumar with Crédit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG: I was wondering, related to foundries, some of the large GPU customers of foundries have talked about some [indiscernible] (37:10), and there were general concern about inventories, potentially some softening in PC data point. So I was wondering if any of this is having an effect, in terms of what foundry customers are thinking in terms of orders if you look beyond the July quarter. And secondly, my follow-up is on NAND flash. At what point is the lower level of orders that you're getting from NAND flash would be considered not a cyclical fact, but something [indiscernible] (37:42) the productivity is higher for NAND flash for some reason, if you look into the CapEx investment?
Michael Splinter: We try to watch inventory pretty closely because we do think it's a leading indicator. But this is Q2. It's generally the softest quarter for our customers' demand. And we've been trying to see if there's really any place where there's something that's out of line from a days of inventory or from a historic days of inventory, and we still see inventories in a pretty healthy range. Now could one product be out of line and we missed it? I guess that's possible. When we look at the seasonality through Q2, we haven't seen anything that would raise alarm bells at this point. On the NAND flash question, of course, NAND has great productivity, and it depends whether the growth is going to be on two-bits or three-bits-per-cell or one-bit-per-cell kind of devices, how much productivity they get. But frankly, I think that the capacity is quite stretched right now. If the iPad or products like it -- I assume some other major computer companies are coming out with similar products in that category. If they just sell something close to 7 million to 10 million units in the second half of the year, it will seriously stretch NAND flash capacity. We think that to supply that, you need something between 250,000 and 300,000 wafers. I'm not sure where those are going to come from because everyone today is pretty much already utilized.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer & Co.
Wenge Yang - Oppenheimer: This is Wenge Yang for Gary. Couple of questions. First one, is regarding your $27 billion WFE guidance. And if I use '06 market share of 30% for AMAT, we are looking at about $8 billion sales in Silicon revenues, maybe Silicon plus AGS. So based on FQ2 and FQ3, does that indicate upper kind of sales volume for October and January quarter? That's my first question.
Michael Splinter: Well, I wish we would've had 31% share in 2006. I think we had 21% share in 2006. So when we say that by the end of this year, we should have exceeded that, it's in that range, not in the 30-plus percent range. So if we redo the math and say, $27 billion times 20-plus percent, I think you get in the middle fives. And if that goes up a little bit, our revenue will go up with it.
Wenge Yang - Oppenheimer: If we look at the supply constraint to be relieved, and also, you have some additional savings in terms of SunFab costs, is it an indication that your guidance for OpEx at $520 million to $540 million has some additional improvement rooms in the coming quarters?
George Davis: Wenge, the $520 million to $540 million is with today's run rate. Obviously, if there's actions that accelerate reductions, it might come outside of that range. But you've got a little bit of room in that range anyway. So we'll leave it at $520 million to $540 million for right now.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: First question is regarding operating expense. So you guys guided for $520 million to $540 million by end of this fiscal year. And previously, you talked about your cost reduction program being 18 month. Care to kind of give some color in term of what you expect your OpEx can be in the first half of fiscal '11?
George Davis: We had said that we were looking for OpEx savings, on an annualized run rate, of $200 million to $250 million by the end of the program. When we started and announced the program, our revenue outlook for the year was well more than $2 billion lower than the outlook that we have today. And so some of the -- what we said is that the programs, while they're continuing, we see the gains from those programs in the latter part of the 18-month program, mainly because, quite frankly, it's all hands on deck meeting customer ramps and also just the higher OpEx that comes with the additional revenue. As you've seen from our flow-through, we're passing a lot of profitability through, but there is incremental OpEx that comes with higher revenue. But we still believe that the approximate $450 million in overall savings from our program initiatives is achievable. But again, it's going to be back-end loaded, and the absolute level of OpEx will reflect both the benefits of those savings and whatever the underlying revenues is for the company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: And then just a quick follow-up on Display. You guys have talked about that expect maybe to see more orders come in more like kind of fourth quarter of this year, and so maybe more like fiscal first quarter for you guys. Is that still the expectation for Display that [ph] (44:06) you report better result this quarter, or was that some pull in that might moderate that? How do we look at that?
George Davis: The movements around are really not push-out pull-in type. It is a number of factors, not the least, but which is just -- it's very broad-based, so you have a lot of customers that are making their plans. You have a number of customers who are looking at both capacity expenses in their traditional manufacturing locations, but also looking at getting permission or making the arrangements to open manufacturing in China. The timing of that is just more uncertain, and so that really accounts for most of the movements.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Stephen O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank AG: Were the backlog adjustments of $184 million, was that all SunFab? And secondly, with your present SunFab customers, do you have production data from them that gives you high confidence that it can be competitive within the next year or so?
George Davis: So let me take the backlog question first. No, the backlog adjustments were mostly EES and the thin film was the largest of the cancellations. But you also have some push-outs heavily weighted towards wafering, whereas you have some movements in and out of our one year booking cycle there. And then you have FX adjustments of $36 million, which quite frankly, was mostly euro, which is all crystal and Silicon sales, which are made out of Europe. You have some minor contributions, minor cancellations and debookings, normal puts and takes in the services and Silicon area. But it was really EES that was the dominant contributor overall, thin film, the largest of that, in terms of cancellations.
Michael Splinter: To your question about SunFab production data. Yes, we have quite a bit of data now on how the factories are running, how the yields and efficiencies are going, how tightly they're distributed. So I think we have a very good assessment of what size factories have to be, and what efficiency and performance productivity has to be at for them to be competitive.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: I had a couple of them. One is, Mike, what percentage of your orders do you think in April was capacity driven? And where do you think that's going to be in July or maybe in the second half of the year?
Michael Splinter: Sure. This relates to semiconductor, so we think that close to 60% were capacity driven. And this quarter, we think that will increase a bit yet over the next couple of quarters. And there's a fairly big shift from Q1, and certainly, from any time last year where almost all the orders were technology driven.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: And in terms of the wafer fab equipment, you said that you expect it to be a multi-year cycle. Given that you're kind of heading towards the middle of 2010, would you care to take early [ph] swag at where you think 2011 wafer fab equipment or CapEx would be?
Michael Splinter: I don't really want to take much of a swag. But I'd just say, up until really the last week or so, I wouldn't have thought that we could exceed kind of 2006 and '07 levels or be in that ballpark. If the economy stays strong and all the normal caveats, I think we could certainly be in that range that we were in for wafer fab equipment spending in 2006 and '07, and in [ph] (48:20) 2011.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I know you don't want to talk specifically on customers. But with the recent public announcement by Samsung of its increased CapEx for 2010, how have other interactions with your other DRAM customers gone? And is this the majority of the broadening of the customer base that you're seeing, as we progress into midyear and the second half?
Michael Splinter: I think as you look at what's happening in this market, we're seeing broadening, and really, in most spaces, from DRAM to flash to foundry. Obviously, in Logic, there's not that many players anymore. That there's just a few of them that are the biggest part of Logic, so -- but I think we're seeing broadening in all of the different segments. It's hard to tell what the impact of Samsung's announcement will have on the broader industry. But I think, if I was going to characterize it, I would characterize it as representative of growing confidence across the industry and willingness to invest heavily again in semiconductor capacity.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And my follow-up question is, you mentioned another quarter where you expect a high-level of turn business. When do you think that things return to a more, I guess, normal conditions where you typically see that lag of a quarter or two between orders and revenue? Or do you believe that you can sustain this type of turns business for your customers on a going forward basis?
Michael Splinter: I kind of think this is the new normal. That customers are believing, especially the larger customers which is the bulk of the business, believe that they can work with us ahead of time, but order at a very short lead time. And we've really worked hard and will continue to work hard on our operations to drive speed, quality and cost. And on the speed front, this is really, I think, going to provide some differentiation over time in the industry, because customers are going to want to have those short lead times to add capacity.
George Davis: And Patrick, it's one of the reasons why we've invested in logistics and light manufacturing capability in Singapore, and are putting a lot of effort into our Pan Asia supply chain development, because all those element are critical to cycle time. And I think you've observed an important trend. Cycle time is very important to our customers, and that's not likely to change.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC: Mike, you mentioned that you see now 11 semi fabs over the next couple of years. I'm wondering if you can give a little color on what type those fabs are. And I'm curious, in the LED space, how many fabs you're tracking. And I guess as a follow-up, I'm curious in LED, if you think that you stand to gain sort of meaningful market share in the LCD TV backlighting kind of transition or going through, sort of what your ambition and investment levels are in that area.
Michael Splinter: So on the semiconductor side, on the fabs we're tracking, it is a mix. But I would say, the largest additional wafers would be in NAND, in part, just because they build such huge factories. Next would be in DRAM and then in foundry. But it's pretty broad-based overall. And there's some in every one of the segments. The number of fabs are pretty balanced by segment, it's just the size that puts NAND out in the lead. In LED, there are quite a number of fabs that are being built. But what we're really trying to do right now is focus in on working with customers to qualify our machine. And we believe that we have differentiation and can add value to customers, and as our machine gets qualified in production, we'll see significant growth in that area.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC: Any sense for how long? Or what's your expectation for how long it may take for LED to represent anything meaningful for you from either, I guess, in the order perspective first?
Michael Splinter: Well, we haven't introduced the product yet. So I think, when we introduce the product, we'll talk about the market and a lot of detail on our expectations of where we're going. So it's just a little difficult for me to be more precise than that, considering where we are at this point in our public position on the product.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Arete Research.
Jagadish Iyer - UBS: First, is that in your EES bookings, how should we think about crystalline silicon versus thin film? And as a follow-up here, how should we think about the sustainability of crystalline silicon bookings going into the back half of the year?
George Davis: The bookings right now are predominantly coming from crystalline silicon today. So we were seeing very strong demand, again, mostly from China, both from wafering and from customers for metallization. And that, as Mike said, this was the strongest order quarter for us. And it was really defined by crystalline silicon.
Michael Splinter: Jagadish, I would just add. We are really trying to watch the indicators here very closely, mostly because of those items that I mentioned. Is the devaluing of the euro going to have an impact on demand? Are the austerity programs and some of the countries in Europe going to have impact on incentives? Is there really overcapacity? We're trying to watch all these things very closely, so we adjust if we see something. But right now, demand is very, very strong.
Jagadish Iyer - UBS: On the foundries, how should we think about the second half, in terms of foundry orders, versus your first half? Do you see kind of sustainable spending in the foundries going into the back half of the year?
Michael Splinter: Yes, so far, it seems sustainable. If you look at our Q3, looks as good as Q2 for foundries. So we aren't making any projections about our Q4 yet, but so far, so good.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Darice Liu with Brigantine Advisors.
Darice Liu - Brigantine Advisors: With the decision for further cuts in EES to achieve profitability next year, can you provide what you're target breakeven will be for that segment? And the follow-up is, now that you are shifting your focus less on SunFab, can you provide some color on where and what products you expect growth to stem from in the EES segment this year and next?
George Davis: Let me deal with the breakeven. We said we had looked to get to breakeven around the $1 billion level. We'll address breakeven for 2011 when we complete the plan that's being developed currently, and we'll have a better sense for what it looks like next year.
Michael Splinter: On the products that we expect to continue to grow in EES, crystalline silicon. Just the products like the sidewell double patterning product, customers are very, very interested in that. We have over 50 customers in China, and we're really, I think, have very good relationships with all of them. And I think that gives us a significant opportunity, as that part of the industry grows, to grow with it. I think, as we talked about LEDs earlier, we have very high aspirations there as we introduce the product and get it into the marketplace. Those would be, by far, the two biggest areas.
Operator: And our final question is a follow-up from the line of Tim Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: Relative to your SunFab business, you still have $400 million sitting in backlog. And I'm sort of wondering, given that you're winding the business down, it seem like you were spending maybe $30 million to $40 million per quarter on OpEx in that business. And I'm sort of wondering what you're winding it down to? That's my first question. I.e. What will be left? And secondly, whether there's any potential liability issues with the remaining systems there sitting in backlog? So is there any potential that there are sort of negative equity value that a customer could come back at you for closing the business down or not meeting any sort of specification that you promised in those bookings?
George Davis: Well, as Mike said, one of our key criteria for the plan is that we meet all existing customer commitments. We've signed up virtually -- we've met factory acceptance on virtually every factory installed to date. In fact, the revenue shortfall that we're seeing is typically coming from customers being unable to pay bonus obligations that reflect performance in the factories above original specification. The majority of the inventory that we have today is associated with installed equipment in factories that we expect to sign up at the end of this year. So we have every intent to continue to support our existing customers and to meet our commitments, and don't believe that's going to be a source of major risk for the company.
Michael Splinter: And George, I think Tim's second part of his question was about OpEx. And I think, until our plan is done.
George Davis: Right. Same answer to that is in the previous situation. We really have to complete the plan. We'll discuss the results of that as soon as it's available.
Michael Sullivan: And at this point, we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of today's call will be available on our website beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today. The replay and our earnings slide package will remain on our website until the 2nd of June. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Marcello and good afternoon. Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Sweeney, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Today, we will discuss the results for our first quarter, which ended on January 31st. Our earnings release was issued at 1.05 Pacific Time and you could find a copy on Business Wire and on our website appliedmaterials.com. Mike Splinter will be off the call with comments on the business environment and our strategies. George will follow and discuss our financial performance for Q1 and our expectations for Q2 and the rest of the year. We will then open the call for your questions. Before we begin, I have a quick calendar announcement. Applied will hold its 2010 Analyst Meeting in New York City on the afternoon of March 30th local time. We hope to see you at the meeting and we will have a live webcast and replay for anyone who won't be able to join us in person. We will be sure to provide you with further details about the event over the next few weeks. And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Mike Splinter.
Mike Splinter: Thanks, Mike and welcome to today's call. Applied generated strong growth in our first quarter, led by our Silicon Systems Group, which grew net sales by nearly 50%. Our business momentum continues and we are raising our company-wide fiscal year sales outlook to growth of more than 50%. We completed the acquisition of Semitool, giving us new growth opportunities in semiconductor equipment and leadership in advanced packaging. We also took actions to improve our efficiency and bring the core of our operations closer to more of our customers. The steep ramp in SSG challenged our manufacturing and field support operations. And I'd like to thank our teams and suppliers for working especially hard to meet our customers' needs. I'll now comment on each of our businesses. We now expect SSG sales to more than double in fiscal 2010. We have raised our wafer fab equipment spending projection to a range of $21 billion to $23 billion for the calendar year and we view 2010 as just the first year of a strong investment cycle. Memory prices remain high, encouraging customers to invest in the next generation of technology. In 2010, bit demand for memory is expected to outpace supply. Foundries are investing aggressively for their transition to 32-nanometers and for capacity additions at 45-nanometers. We believe the next phase of investment will be driven by DRAM technology transitions along with capacity expansions in both flash memory and foundry. Customers are also discussing plans for new fabs, which should lead to increased equipment spending in 2011. We expect this year to be a – to have strong competitive gains with more than 2 points of share growth across SSG. We expect Applied's etch sales to more than double in the calendar year, reflecting market growth, share gains, and favorable memory customer exposure. Increased memory spending is also the catalyst for our Brightfield system, giving us the opportunity to gain 5 points of share in the nearly $1 billion wafer defect inspection market. In radical inspection, we expanded our installed base with another strategic placement at a major foundry. In CMP, our new Reflexion GT is gaining traction as it allows customers to greatly reduce the cost of consumables. And our new Astra laser anneal system is enabling advanced transistors at 32-nanometers and beyond. In PVD and CVD, we are on track to gain share leading edge where steps are being added in metal gate, silicides, gap fill, and packaging. We are very pleased with the progress of our Semitool acquisition. We have been collaborating with Semitool in advanced packaging for years, allowing us to hit the ground running with a suite of products to serve a growing market, which is expected to reach nearly $800 million by 2012. For example, we expect to have at least 25 Charger PVD systems installed for packaging in 2010. In AGS, the number of semiconductor tools under contract in Asia grew by 20% year-over-year and we are focusing on additional service and spares growth in the region, which is expected to drive 75% of all new wafer capacity. The display industry sees strong demand in LCD TVs, particularly in China. High factory utilization of around 90% is leading customers to plan for new capacity. We expect display equipment spending to grow by more than 60% over approximately the next 12 months. Looking ahead, we expect Applied's orders to increase, driven by higher investments in Gen 8.5 capacity over the cycle. We have ramped our manufacturing facility in Taiwan and maintain our system lead times despite this transition. Our Gen 10 CVD systems are now proven in production and we are ready to ramp this next generation of glass size. In solar, worldwide PVD – PV installations are expected to be up 50% year-over-year with about half of this growth in European countries outside of Germany. Module prices have absorbed the polysilicon price drops and we see price declines moderating ahead of the German FiT adjustment. In China, the government has made solar a national priority and crystalline silicon solar manufacturers are responding by boosting capacity. We expect 5 gigawatts to 7 gigawatts of incremental capacity additions in China this year, which represents a near doubling from '09. Globally, we see the possibility of up to 9 gigawatts of capacity additions. Solar CapEx should exceed $4 billion this calendar year and factory utilization across the industry is reported to be around 50%. And today's aggressive capacity additions could lead to over-supply and a reduction in investment plans. The strong solar capacity expansion in China has been a positive for our crystalline silicon business. We achieved signoffs for our new Baccini Esatto technology in the quarter as double printing became established at multiple customers. And we expect our Baccini cell systems to gain 3 points of metallization share in 2010. Turning to SunFab, we achieved signoff at two new lines during the quarter, bringing the total to nine. The price declines in crystalline silicon modules have exerted margin pressure at some of our thin film customers, in some cases lowering their demand and factory utilization to very low levels. We made further progress on driving SunFab module efficiency and cost reductions to help customers be more competitive. Two customers announced large development projects this quarter and our customers now have 30 megawatts of modules installed, providing field performance data to demonstrate the capabilities of our technology. I'd like to comment briefly on the recent events in Korea. As you know, several of our employees were charged with improperly using customer-confidential information. We are working with the Korean prosecutor and also conducting our own investigation in order to better understand the facts and the situation. Applied has strict policies and procedures designed to protect our customers' confidential information. We are also committed to upholding high ethical standards in all of our business dealings. And for more than 40 years, we have developed a history of outstanding intellectual property protection, which is at the heart of our company's values. The conduct described by the charges is not consistent with either our policies or the great work performed by Applied's talented and dedicated employees. It is important to note that Applied Materials has not been charged in this case. Our focus at this time is on being close to our customers, helping them to meet a steep ramp and ensuring that the strategic relationships and trust that we've built over many years remain strong. In closing, our goal is to lead the industry in our core semiconductor market, expand our opportunities in display and services, and drive new growth in energy and environmental solutions. We are also significantly improving our efficiency and effectiveness to deliver outstanding profitability for the long term. I'll now hand the call over to George for more details on our financial results and targets. George?
George Davis: Thank you, Mike and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Applied's financial performance improved in a strengthening business environment with results in the upper end of our target range, led by strong operating performance in our Silicon Systems Group. Applied's orders were up 33% sequentially, driven almost entirely by SSG. Net sales increased 21% to $1.85 billion with growth in all segments, except Display. We reported non-GAAP net income of $179 million or $0.13 per share. Our GAAP results included restructuring and acquisition charges, along with investment impairments that together reduced earnings by $0.07 per share. As a reminder, our non-GAAP results and guidance now include stock-based compensation. Our backlog increased by $200 million to $2.9 billion, in line with order growth. The net positive backlog adjustment of $79 million was driven primarily by the Semitool acquisition. Please note that except for ending balances, the Semitool acquisition will be included in our results, beginning in Q2, reported on a one-month lag through the end of this fiscal year. The company generated operating cash flow of $367 million or 20% of sales. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.2 billion, a reduction from Q4 of just under $70 million despite spending $323 million for Semitool and $80 million for dividends. Turning to spending, operating expenses grew as expected and included $24 million in acquisition and legal costs that were not in our November outlook. Our non-GAAP operating expenses grew during the quarter by approximately $90 million, primarily due to the elimination of certain temporary savings impacting base and variable compensation and the absence of approximately $20 million in favorable adjustments in our Q4 numbers. During the quarter, we took restructuring charges of $104 million and realized $12 million in net savings from our longer-term cost initiatives. In the balance of the year, we expect our operating expenses to be between $520 million and $540 million per quarter. This run rate includes $25 million in quarterly spending for Semitool, the elimination of shutdowns, and incremental spending to support the steep business ramp, partially offset by ongoing cost initiatives. We remain focused on our longer-term initiatives to enhance the company's Pan-Asia supply chain, to integrate our sales teams into the business units, and to improve our back-office and IT infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. These programs are still expected to deliver $450 million of annualized cost savings by the end of our fiscal quarter – second fiscal quarter of 2011. We expect these benefits to be back-end loaded due to the intensity of the ramp. Beginning in Q1, we move certain costs associated with sales and marketing and variable compensation adjustments into the operating segments. This treatment provides a clear picture of each segment's performance and the change reduced each segment's operating margin by 1 point to 3 points in Q1. Of course, these changes have no impact on the company's overall results; a reconciliation is provided on our website. Turning to the segments, Silicon Systems Group orders increased by 80% over Q4 with four customers accounting for over 65% of the total. Net sales in the quarter grew 48%, well above our expectations of greater than 20%. This is a very steep ramp from 2009 levels and our supply chain was challenged during the quarter to meet demand. Our customers continue to expect short lead times and just over 70% of our sales were from orders received in the quarter. SSG operating profit of $306 million was up nearly 6 points from Q4, reflecting strong flow-through and some offset due to higher compensation accruals and above-normal logistics and expediting costs. We see room for further margin improvement as net sales increase. In Applied Global Services, orders increased 41% off a low Q4 level and net sales were up 9% on higher fab utilization and increased wafer starts. Operating margin declined 2 points to 15%, primarily due to low-margin refurbished systems. Display orders decreased slightly in Q1, but we expect momentum later in the year as customers remain on track for new-gen 8.5 investments. Net sales of $132 million were lower as anticipated and operating margin was down modestly to 18.9%. In EES, orders decreased 36%, primarily due to declines in thin film solar. Orders for crystalline silicon solar equipment more than tripled versus Q4 on strong demand for our wafering and cell products, particularly from China. Net sales increased to $321 million, driven by two SunFab signoffs. Growth of 15% was close to our expectation of 20%. While EES reported a modest loss this quarter, we are still targeting EES to be breakeven on a non-GAAP basis for the year, based on crystalline silicon profitability and SunFab signoffs in the latter part of our fiscal year. Non-GAAP breakeven represents a $160 million improvement over 2009 and is one of the most important profit enhancement efforts for the company in 2010. Now, let me talk about our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year and for Q2. While second half visibility remains limited, we are encouraged by strong demand across most of our customers' end markets. As a result, we expect sales to be up by more than 50% in fiscal 2010 or by more than $2.5 billion over 2009. We expect SSG sales to be up more than 100% in fiscal 2010, reflecting growth in capital spending, improved market share, and the addition of Semitool. We expect AGS sales to be up in the range of 30% this fiscal year, in line with higher utilization rates and wafer starts. We expect Display sales to be up 30% year-over-year, in line with the industry ramp. We also expect EES sales to be in the range of flat to plus or minus 10% for the fiscal year with upside potential if crystalline silicon solar equipment demand remains strong in the second half. Our tax rate for the full year is expected to be in the range of 31% to 33%. Now, I'll discuss our second quarter business environment. We remain cautious with respect to forecasting orders, particularly due to limited visibility as a result of the high turns business in SSG. Currently, our best estimate is that total company orders will be up by more than 10% quarter-over-quarter. SSG should continue to benefit from strong foundry and memory demand and sales are expected to be up by more than 25% in the quarter. AGS sales are expected to grow by more than 10%, reflecting a return to more normalized spending per wafer pass. In Display, the second quarter is shaping up to be one of the strongest – to be the strongest of the fiscal year with sales projected to more than double Q1 levels. EES sales are expected to decrease by more than 25% as growth in crystalline silicon solar equipment is more than offset by a near-term decline in thin film solar sales. We expect the company's overall net sales to be up by 15% to 25% in Q2. We also expect our non-GAAP quarterly earnings to be between $0.17 and $0.22 per share, which equates to profits growing at more than twice the rate of sales. Now, Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, George. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Marcello, let's please begin.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Chin – UBS: Hey, thank you. Hi Mike, hi George. Question on the Silicon guidance for the April quarter. Now, it would suggest that Applied is still about 30% below the quarterly peak of Silicon sales that you saw in the 2007 cycle. Now, what's your view on the possibility to surpass the peak sales level during this current up-cycle, especially if it's driven by these foundry customers? And my follow-up question to that is similar on the Silicon segment operating margin. Do you think Applied can surpass those operating margins in 2007 and can you give us a comparable operating margin in 2007 that allocates some of these corporate overhead costs that we have in the measure of Applied on? Thanks.
Mike Splinter: Thanks, Stephen. That was a complex question, but okay, I'll try to take the first part and George can take the second part. On the – I think we are at least on orders be closer to 80% than 70%. But it's really hard to tell where the peak is going to be. I think the peak would have to get to something approaching $30 billion kind of run rate and – in WFE and we really haven't thought that that's possible at this point to surpass the kind of Q2 levels of 2007. So that's kind of where we are and we – it's just tough to have a visibility into what's going to happen in the second half as more investment broadens out from the small number of companies who are investing in semiconductor capacity today.
George Davis: Stephen, hi. With respect to operating profit, we kind of peaked out in Q3 '07 at a 39 – just over 39%. So if you took 2 points off of that at about 37%, that would have been the peak operating margin, but generally we were operating closer to the low-to-mid 30s and I don't see any reason why we won't achieve those operating margins in this environment.
Michael Sullivan: Great. Thanks, Stephen, for your questions. Marcello, may we please have the next?
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Great, guys. Good afternoon, thanks so much for taking the question. I guess I'll start with flash. Flash 13% of SSG orders, what – what's the kind of timing and trajectory that we would expect for recovery in flash orders?
Mike Splinter: Yes, Jim. Flash, as you know, at 13% is well below where a run rate would be to sustain kind of a big growth of what we think could be close to 100% or so. So we are expecting that flash is going to come back in the second half of the year as the major flash producers start to invest. And so that first half, second half, we expect that when you look at it at the end of the year, flash will be close to 20% of the overall CapEx spending and wafer fab equipment spending.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Terrific. For my follow-up, maybe for George, relative to the significant cost cuts that you guys made, are we seeing the full impact of those in the P&L kind of in the April quarter or is there still more impact in the back – in the calendar second quarter and the back half of the year as the cost cuts flow through? Thanks.
George Davis: Yes, thanks, Jim. I think April quarter is really where you will see the full flow-through of any temporary cost reductions coming back and we still have some shutdown days, normal holiday shutdown days in the first quarter. Those all go out and then obviously with the ramp of the business being stronger than we had anticipated, there is some variable comp that comes along with. But that should be pretty much reflected in Q2.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Jim. (inaudible) take the next one?
Operator: Yes, sir. Our next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. First question on the cost cutting side, I guess. Could you guide to gross margin and OpEx and then digging a little bit deeper, part of the major restructuring you talked about, can you tell us what percentage is in COGS, what percentage is in OpEx and cognizant of that $520 million to $540 million OpEx that you are targeting in the next couple of quarters, where would that number look like when all is done around that Q2 fiscal '11 time frame that you discussed earlier?
George Davis: Great. Let me just start with what we said. We expect cost savings to be about $450 million. About $250 million of that will be OpEx. I would expect, again, the cost to be back-end loaded. So at $250 million, that’s roughly $60 million a quarter. We said there was about $12 million a quarter already reflected in the – in our first quarter, so – with that adjustment. Our focus, as you know, in the near term is really managing to the ramp, but many of the programs that we have are longer term and we are continuing work on those including things like our Pan-Asia supply chain, making the organizational adjustments we've had such as moving sales into the business units. All these things are continuing, but some of the impacts will be pushed out as we've got kind of all hands of deck to manage the ramp.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Great. And as a follow-up, on the crystalline silicon side, can you talk about that business a little bit on the standalone basis? What percentage of the EES revenues could that be in fiscal 2010 and what kind of margin trajectory do you see through the fiscal year?
George Davis: So it – I mean, it has been – it was – it has been about half of the order – or excuse me, the revenue and order profile for EES for the last couple of years. In terms of – in – it's probably a reasonable assumption for 2010 as well. It could be a little bit higher if we get a significant ramp in the second – the ramp continues in the second half in China for crystalline silicon and from a – from an operating margin standpoint, it's well into the double digits now and it's been a solid business for us.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I asked this question last time as well. On the foundry intensity, I mean, we are seeing pretty high levels of foundry intensity this – last year, the foundry intensity was about 45%. So just your thoughts on foundry spending sustainability in second half. I understand the memory can pick up in second half.
Mike Splinter: Yes. I think that right now the foundry spending has really localized primarily to one company. So what we are expecting to see in the second half is broader investment from the rest of the members of the foundry community, but I think the leading foundries already announced how much they are going to spend for the year. So we are going to see that – it's front-half loaded.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then a quick follow-up. What are the lead times on your wire saws HCT Wafering business right now?
Mike Splinter: It's inside two quarters.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Okay, thanks.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Atif.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Yes, hi. Thanks. Firstly on Silicon guidance, if I take the 25% revenue growth you gave in the April quarter and the 100% year-on-year growth, I think you are actually talking about a 50% revenue decline from the April quarter level into July and October. Is that how you are seeing the year play out in Silicon?
Mike Splinter: Satya, I think the way we describe the second half of the year and the semiconductor business is – and you realize there is pretty limited visibility here in the second half at this point. But what we are thinking is it's flat to plus or minus 10% in the second half. If we have strong flash memory investment and we see the rest of the foundry guys coming into the game, we could see plus 10%. If we don't see that, we can kind of get minus 10% and I think that's probably what we are thinking right now.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Okay. In terms of the solar, a quick follow-up. You mentioned that there is currently a stabilization in crystalline silicon pricing ahead of the German FiT cuts, but still margins are being pressured for your SunFab customers. Supposing we get further pricing pressure for crystalline silicon after the German cuts, would that not cause even more margin pressure on SunFab customers in a quarter or two? When will the SunFab customers become more competitive with crystalline silicon?
Mike Splinter: Well, we've been – certainly, if you look at variable costs, they are already competitive and they are getting more competitive as we work with them to enhance the performance of the factories, which – the factories are really running quite well. So I think – but the bigger point on crystalline silicon, if the capacity comes on the way we think it is, this is going to – there is going to be a lot of pressure on pricing in the second half until more demand is created. We are still looking for demand to be created at a higher level in the U.S. and China and in India maybe in the second half and into 2011.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Satya.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.
Wenge Yang – Oppenheimer: Hi, this is Wenge for Gary. You commented on supply chain constraints and combined with your recent hiring of executive supply chain management. I want to get your opinion on what kind of impact of the supply chain constrained on your costs and operating expenses in terms of overtimes, a higher cost of goods, and also the lead time strategy.
George Davis: Sure. The major impact that we had from the supply chain difficulty this quarter was seen in higher expediting costs and really the costs of logistics in general were above normal and we are seeing improvements in the supply chain in the second quarter. I think we still have a little bit or work – workout to do, but the – there is no connection really between our decision to hire an external party and the challenges we are having here. As you know, we are going to be building up our capability in Singapore to strengthen our Pan-Asia supply chain and really the recent hire is in connection with that activity.
Mike Splinter: And you guys will get a chance to meet Joe at the Analyst Meeting at the end of the March. I think you will like him, he has got a great background and a great hire for us.
Wenge Yang – Oppenheimer: Great.
Michael Sullivan: Wenge, did we fully answer your question?
Operator: Our next – our next question is from the line of Chris Blansett with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Blansett – JPMorgan: Thanks, gentlemen. Question is related to the share gain you indicated earlier and I wanted to understand how much the – maybe mix of demographics of your Silicon System customers is playing into this at this time.
Mike Splinter: Yes, generally we try to shake that out of the share gain before we talk about the share gain itself, because if you just look at the last few years, there has been a huge change in overall revenue and buying patterns in the Silicon segment. So when we talk about share gain, we are really talking about innate gain at customers with winning applications in the various areas. That's kind of general. Do you have a specific question, Chris, about a – one of the product lines?
Chris Blansett – JPMorgan: Well, I was just trying to dig a little more deeper, specifically into the etch business. There is different types of etch, which some investors are aware of and where you think you are doing better versus where you've been in the past and given the shift that's occurring in the etch market with the metal etch product continuing to earmark, continuing to strengthen and dielectric growing, just maybe some color commentary around that?
Mike Splinter: Sure. So we have significantly more exposure in the memory area. That's I think well chronicled. But we've been increasing our applications as well in the memory area, both in flash and in DRAM, in particular, strength in those – in the flash areas of double patterning where we've done an awful lot of work with customers and have been able to gain applications there, as well as in high aspect contacts and those kind of applications and DRAMs, which are becoming increasingly more prevalent. So those are more dielectric – both are dielectric oriented. And we are even starting to see some traction now at some of the foundries, which in the past logic has been our weak point in that.
Chris Blansett – JPMorgan: All right. That's good. Thank you, I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Steve O'Rourke – Deutsche Bank: Thank you. Good afternoon. Couple of questions. First, there has been some – reportedly some substantial share loss in PVD at one of your significant customers. One, could you just comment on your positioning with PVD and how you feel that is? And second question, turns business and the silicon business very high in Q1. Is this kind of the new normal with respect to orders and turns in the quarter?
Mike Splinter: Yes. On PVD, I'd just say the following. First of all, I think primarily what you are aiming at here is copper barrier/seed, which is kind of in the memory area, which is about 30% of the market and 30% of that market. So it's kind of a less than 10%. I don't think there has been any real share shifts. There are shared positions there were – we kind of go back and forth, but when you look at the new applications where the market is growing beyond memory, we are quite strong already in the conversion to copper and in memory. That's one aspect. But in metal gate silicides, that’s a new application, multiple steps in logic. And then as well as in packaging where I mentioned that we have a significant buying pattern for our Charger PVD system and we think that we will end up gaining share on that space in the end of the year.
George Davis: And Steve, on the turns business and the new normal, what I would say is that we have seen certainly a push from all of our customers to shorten our cycle times and that’s – it's one of the reasons why we've gone to a much more modular manufacturing approach and worked very hard to strengthen our supply chain. I would also say that foundry customers, just by the nature of their end markets and the windows that they have to hit those markets, are probably the shortest-cycle customers that we have and so I think you have a little bit of the foundry effect. So I do think short cycle is certainly new normal and I would say we are at – given the mix of foundry right now, we are at the shorter end of that short cycle; and that's probably too many cycles.
Steve O'Rourke – Deutsche Bank: Thank you. That's helpful.
George Davis: Yes, thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Friedman, Billings, and Ramsey. Please go ahead with your question.
Mehdi Hosseini – Friedman, Billings, and Ramsey: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And Mike, going back to earlier commentary about the overall size of the wafer fab equipment market, can you please clarify, did you say that in order for you to exceed the prior peak of SSG revenue, the market has to be $30 billion or $33 billion? And are you also assuming that your market share is not going to be a factor in exceeding the prior peak? Could you please provide some clarification on how to follow up?
Mike Splinter: Sure, Mehdi. What I said was it would have to approach $30 billion, which assumes we are going to be able to grow faster than WFE, because obviously last peak was quite a bit above that number. So I don't want to go down into all the details, but you can assume that we have made those assumptions. But for right now, our projection for this year is $21 billion to $23 billion for wafer fab equipment spending.
Mehdi Hosseini – Friedman, Billings, and Ramsey: Okay. And when do you expect the microprocessor segment of the market to come back and has there – there is a lot of talk about share gain and share loss, etch and PVD. Can you update us on what's going on with the microprocessor segment and when would you expect that segment of the market to come back?
Mike Splinter: Well, I think – as you know, microprocessors are on a note of technology that's generally ahead of the rest of the industry and they invest big in the odd years and order late in the even years. So that's kind of what I'm expecting to continue. We are very encouraged by the growth in the PC market. We thought that – we think overall, the PC market is going to grow 10% to 15% this year. If you saw HP's results earlier today, they said they had 26% increase in PC shipments. That's gigantic. So I would think that if that continues, capacity additions have to follow pretty quickly.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you, Mehdi.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.
Patrick Ho – Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks a lot. Two questions. First, what do you see on maybe a qualitative or even on a quantitative basis in terms of the customer mix for your semi orders in 2Q? And related to that, can you describe what you could see in terms of the sustainability of DRAM orders at least over the next few quarters? What would drive DRAM orders to be more sustainable than some of the perceptions out there that it will be first-half loaded?
Mike Splinter: Thanks, Patrick. The word I think I would use to describe orders, not only in Q1 but Q2, is concentrated. They are quite concentrated – both revenue and orders are still quite concentrated at a very small number of companies. On the sustainability of DRAM, I just think that depends in big part on how the cell phone and PC markets go. Right now, we don't see enough capacity to meet kind of 60% bit growth, if it gets that high. We've been updating our analysis there and our estimates from – I think earlier in the last call we said 35% to 40%. We are kind of now in the 55% to 60%, but DRAM is undersupplied right now and we don't see that getting ahead of demand for the next few quarters.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Patrick.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: Hey, thanks a lot for taking my question. First question regarding the Silicon side of business, Mike, you mentioned that you started to see signs that some customer might add new fabs. Any color you can add to that or is that more for 2011 time frame and in which area in terms of memory versus foundry versus DRAM? Are you looking at – are you seeing customer looking to add new fabs?
Mike Splinter: Yes, we are looking at nine new fabs that customers are talking about and we think are coming close to announcements. So maybe they get announced in – over the next couple of quarters. Almost all of these are for 2011 capacity. There is one that could still be up in 2010 – late 2010. That one would be a flash fab. But a couple of these are DRAM fabs – several of them are foundry factories, I guess. Other than naming everyone, that's about as far as I'll go.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: That was great color. Thanks. And then just a follow-up question regarding the flat-panel display area. You mentioned that you expect capital – equipment spending to be up 60% this year, yet you only guide for revenue to be up 30%. How do you reconcile between that and I understand you have a new PVD product in that area too. Can you give some color on that?
George Davis: Sure, Edwin. Yes, it's a good question. The 60% is a calendar year forecast and as you know, we have a fiscal year that misses two of those months. We expect the shipment and revenue activity to be strong both in '09 – or excuse me, in 2010 and the first part of '11 and I think any difference between the market forecast and our revenue forecast is really just revenue timing.
Mike Splinter: Yes.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Edwin.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Gus Richard with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Yes. Just in terms of the broadening out of spend. A lot of people have difficulty below 40-nanometers, lot of people won't have cleanroom space, lot of people don't have money. Sort of in those constraints, how do you see those getting relieved over the next year or so?
Mike Splinter: Well, most people have technology partners today. So I think the places where there is real limitations or fundamental limitations on technology are very few. There can always be yield problems and product problems, those kinds of things, but I don't think that's fundamental. And I think the money issue is that had plagued a big part of the industry last year when no – when profits were low and in 2008, are solely being relieved as prices stay high, particularly in memory and more – we take – we look at this profitability very, very closely, because we do think ability to take on indebted customers is a very important factor. It'd have to give access to capital. And then I do think – of course, there is the question of litho cell availability. I think that's a thing we also watch closely because of the cost of that element of the equipment supply.
Gus Richard – Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then just as my follow-on, given the tightness of advanced litho systems in the world today, does that present an opportunity for Applied in self-aligned double patterning? Are you seeing that gain traction with your customers or any thoughts there?
Mike Splinter: Yes. I think we are seeing pretty much everybody trying some level of double patterning, different levels in production and the flash guys clearly are – have mastered this technique in production these days and we are working very, very closely, our share in that space is quite good because of how much knowledge we gained early on in that technology.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Gus.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Banc of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Krish Sankar – Banc of America-Merrill Lynch: Yes, great. Thanks. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on the $21 billion to $23 billion wafer fab spending this year. How do you think wafer fab equipment spending can go before we hit a road block of new fabs or filling out empty shelves? And a follow-up on the cost reduction. George, if I remember right, the $450 million reduction goal is given prior to the Semitool acquisition. So post Semitool acquisition, could you update us on what the new goal would be for the cost reduction?
Mike Splinter: Hi, Krish. So we don't see any space issues to $23 billion. I don't think that there are space issues for some significant amount above that. So usually factory managers and companies are quite imaginative about how to create space if they need it for capacity and it's – I don't think we know how to do a calculation that says how – exactly how much space there is and how much money it would take to fill that space. But it's not at $23 billion.
George Davis: And Krish, on – in terms of the cost reduction, the $450 million program is really about long-term structural change for the company. It's not meant to capture all activities in the company. For Semitool, what we've said is that it will be cash accretive in year one and GAAP accretive in year two and we have synergy programs that support that, but we have not disclosed that.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Krish.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. First question on flat panel. You are looking for a strong shipment towards the end of the year, but your orders are pretty low at $130 million [ph]. So it's safe to assume that you should have a pretty significant order growth – 100% kind of order growth in FPD next quarter?
George Davis: Yes. We are expecting healthy order growth next quarter.
Mike Splinter: Yes, that's George Davis speak.
George Davis: No, as you know, we don't guide to orders in individual segments, but Display is certainly one of the areas along with the Silicon that we are expecting positive improvement.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: And the second one on your yearly revenue guidance for Silicon System. Of the 100%, is that including the Semitool acquisition, because you said something in your prepared statements – something – a 100% increase and $2.5 billion also you said the revenue increase, I'm not (inaudible) clearly.
George Davis: Those are different things. The 100% does include the effect of Semitool. Remember, we will have three quarters of Semitool in the year and it includes really all of the factors, whether it be share gain, growth in the market, we – and we said more than 100%. So that's for the full year. The $2.5 billion is really – is just a simple math of saying we are going to be up more than 50% year-over-year. So that's 50% on top of the $5 billion last year; that's where the $2.5 billion came from.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. All right, thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, Mahesh. And then I would like to see if we have time for one more question, please.
Operator: Our last question is from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Arete Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Jagadish Iyer – Arete Research: Thanks George, thanks Mike, for taking the question. Two questions. The first question, I don't know, Mike, whether you called out on your silicon market share. I just wanted to find out what is your market share; what will be your market share by the end of '10 in terms of your served available market for both '10 and what you think it will project out for '11, please?
Mike Splinter: Sure. We really don't usually give out the specific market share versus our SAM, Jagadish. This – I think I can suffice it to say that we think we are going to gain 2 points this year over last year and we pretty much agree with the third party's assessment from – of our position from last year.
Jagadish Iyer – Arete Research: Just one follow-up question. Mike, given the situation on the SunFab, I was just wondering whether – are you going to revisit your strategy in terms of thin film solar? Has there been some change in your customer outlook given the new entrance and particularly (inaudible), which have higher efficiencies? So I just wanted to find out whether you have any thoughts on that. Any commentary would be great. Thanks.
Mike Splinter: Sure. Obviously, as I said in prepared remarks, SunFab customers have been challenged in this current environment. The utilization of the SunFab factories is kind of at the same level of the entire industry, some fully loaded, some lowly loaded. But fundamentally, this – we believe in the technology and if we didn’t believe in the technology, we would make some big changes, but right now what we are focused on is meeting our commitments to customers. I think that that's a very important aspect of what we are doing with SunFab. And these products are really aimed at a market that's really just starting and that's utility scale solar. When you look at the temperature coefficient, when you look at the incident light, when you look at ambient particles in the air versus the efficiency of these panels, installation costs are huge advantages over other technologies for – and plus of course, the size of the panels. There is big advantages in this field. Now, the field – the utility scale solar has to develop, it's still very nascent market, it's a very small percentage of the total. As you know, most of the market is rooftop and that's where we've been having a lot of success with our crystalline silicon products as well. So we are still very excited about the overall market. We think it's good for long-term growth and we think we know how to make money in the equipment business and that's really fundamentally where we are.
Michael Sullivan: Great.
Jagadish Iyer – Arete Research: Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Jagadish, thank you for your question. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon. A replay of this call and our earnings presentation will be available on our website today, beginning at 5 o'clock Pacific Time today and until March the 3rd. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.

Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO; George Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Sweeney, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Today we’ll discuss the results for our fourth quarter and our 2009 fiscal year that ended on October 25th. We will also talk about our strategic actions and our business outlook for the current quarter and fiscal year. We have a lot of information to share with you today and we’ll do our best to deliver it quickly and make time for your questions. With that, I’ll hand the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael R. Splinter : Applied Materials returned to profitability in Q4 achieving sales and earnings growth that exceeded our expectations. We saw progress across the company with sequential growth in orders, sales and operating profit in every segment. Notably our semiconductor business is in the early phase of a recovery with gross margins exceeding 50% in the quarter demonstrating the strength of the business model. SSG is positioned to drive further profits as WFE expands in 2010. Our operations team responded well to the ramp in demand enabling the company to increase sales by 35% and generate operating cash flow of $241 million. Reviewing ’09 results, I’m pleased to say we made excellent progress on our strategic objectives for the year.  Last November at the onset of the global financial crisis we moved rapidly to lower our cost structure with a program that created $460 million in annualized savings. We aggressively managed working capital maintaining the financial strength to invest for growth. We grew share in our semiconductor equipment business let by gains in inspection, Epi and PVD. We grew our solar revenue by 40% year-over-year and took significant steps towards profitability.  We made substantial investments in our future with more than $900 million in R&D that resulted in new products across each of our markets. Applied was recognized as the number one equipment supplier across semiconductors, LCD displays a now solar PV. Each of our segments represents a substantial growth opportunity for Applied. Our business in multiple industries differentiates us from our competitors giving us unique opportunities for growth and scale. I want to thank the entire Applied team for their extraordinary contributions during a very challenging yet productive year. They focused on satisfying on our customers’ needs and on meeting the ambitious goals we set. Over the past two years we’ve witnessed fundamental changes in the industries we serve including customer consolidation and moderating long term growth rates in WFE. We are focusing this year’s strategic plan on addressing the implementations of these changes to maximize our growth opportunities and improve our competitiveness and efficiency.  Specifically, we are embedding our worldwide sales force within the business units, bringing us closer to our customers and making us more efficient. We are streamlining and consolidating our manufacturing and supply chain operations under one leader to drive best known methods, scalability and cost improvements throughout our businesses. We’re increasing our manufacturing and supply chain presence in Asia to be closer to more of our customers, reduce cycle times and increase the use of a more efficient supply base.  We’re also consolidating our solar business under one executive and aligning our activities with the evolving global market. We’re investing in common businesses processes and improved transaction processing capabilities that will make us leaner and faster and we’re improving our portfolio allocation process while focusing our R&D investments on our opportunities to grow market share.  As recently announced, I’ve also taken actions to align my executive team with the opportunities and challenges ahead. I’ll now comment on each of our businesses. In SSG we expect to grow revenue by at least 40% year-over-year. We estimate WFE to reach $18 to $20 billion in calendar 2010 up from $12 to $13 billion in ’09. Our customers have reported higher factory utilization across the board. DRAM and NAN prices have strengthened encouraging more of our memory customers to invest in our next generation of technology and our foundry customer are investing in capacity additions as well as technology transitions. We gained share in ’09 with strength in a number of areas. PVD and Epi, benefitted from application wins in advance transistors and interconnect. We believe we doubled our reticle inspection share in the year and we recently won a new position at a major NAN manufacturer for in fab applications. Our reticle inspection solution is now in production at four large customers with repeat business at three. Our Brightfield inspection has won positions in advance memory applications while expanding in to immersion lithography at most foundries and we held share in etch.  We expect another year of share gains in calendar 2010 driven by product strength in our leadership areas and growth opportunities in inspection and etch where the outlook for stronger memory spending is a significant positive for Applied. Looking at technology trends, we’re focused on the DRAM conversion to copper, NAN transition to 3x using double patterning, advance transistors in logic and foundry and emerging capabilities like wafer level packaging and 3D memory cells. We’re also focused on extending our strong market positions in PVD, CVD and CMP to the 22 nanometer node. In display we’ve seen strong demand for TVs and LCD monitors over the past several quarters particularly in China. Leading customers have returned to profitability and factory utilization remains high. These trends are leading customers to add capacity and we expect equipment spending in the industry to be up more than 40% in calendar 2010 with the bulk of the purchases concentrated at Gen 8.5. We are now seeing proposals by major customers to build advanced fabs in China. This strategic shift reflects the growing importance of China’s domestic market which saw an 80% year-over-year rise in LCD TV demand. In 2010 we expect to grow or PiVOT PVD position expanding to more customers and gaining an estimated 10 points of share. During the quarter we launched copper capability on the PiVOT system and strategic investment in Gen 10 is moving forward with multiple systems in production. In the [inaudible], while the solar market weakened substantially during the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue grew more than 40% driven by thin film sign offs and strength in crystalline silicon cell manufacturing. During the fourth quarter the solar PV marketplace showed signs of improvement as module price declines slowed and financing opportunities gradually improved. Germany remains a bright spot particularly in the crystalline silicon rooftop market. China and Taiwan are growing markets for our crystalline silicon equipment with capacity growth rates significantly above those of other geographies. In crystalline silicon our customers want to increase automation and improve conversion efficiencies. While the crystalline silicon equipment outlook for 2010 is still uncertain, there is some positive sides for capacity additions in cell equipment primarily at Chinese customers. The drive towards ever lower costs moves the industry to require thinner wafers and thin wafer handling which provides growth opportunities for our MaxEdge wire saw and Baccini metallization systems. Our plan is to address these needs and grow our served market share opportunity in cell equipment from 50% of the cap ex spend to 80% over the next three years. Steps in this direction include our double printing capability on the Baccini platform and our acquisition of Advent Solar last week. Our crystalline silicon install base now exceeds 2,500 systems creating a significant opportunity for service and aftermarket upgrades. Our progress in thin film this year culminated in the seventh customer signoff of a SunFab production line and ENN in China. This was our second tandem junction line. For existing and future SunFab customers we have driven economies of scale with leading suppliers to reduce the cost of materials by 22% and this improved process flow has received IEC certification. With steady gains in panel efficiency and factory productivity across the SunFab network we are on track to our 2010 goal of 10% efficiency and $1.00 per watt cost.  In the near term market conditions are challenging for many of our thin film customers as discounted crystalline silicon panels are impacting and demand for thin film technology. In calendar 2010 we expect worldwide solar PV installations to be up over 40% with solar representing one of Applied’s key growth opportunities over the next several years.  We recently opened a solar R&D center in Xi’an China which demonstrates our substantial commitment to thin film and crystalline silicon technology and is advantageously located in China, the solar market’s fastest growing geography. We’ve become number one in solar equipment and in less than three years we’ve built a billion equipment business that has the scale and global reach of no other competitor. Now, we are on track for EES to deliver breakeven or better operating results during this fiscal year.  In services our orders and revenue increased with 300 millimeter starts returning to prerecession levels. While 200 millimeter wafer starts are down roughly 25% from last year. We expect virtually all of our future service growth to come from 300 millimeter starts expansion. Our spares run rate is up significantly from the trough in Q2 though it is not yet approaching the previous peak. Operating margins are improving and we are focused on driving further efficiencies in services delivery as part of our 2010 strategic initiatives. In semiconductor services, the number of tools under contract grew 7% year-over-year with notably high growth in Asia. A key to growth in AGS is expanding our services in spares position in Asia where over 80% of new wafer starts will be.  In summary, Applied’s goal is to lead the industry and gain share in our core semiconductor markets, drive growth in display and services and greatly expand our opportunities in energy solutions. We will also take advantage of our global footprint and scale to deliver outstanding profitability. After a challenging 2009 we expect sales growth of at least 30% in fiscal 2010 and significant benefits from structuring the company for future success. I will now hand the call over to George for more details on our results and targets.
George S. Davis : Applied completed a challenging fiscal year with a solid fourth quarter including revenue and earnings well above our targets. We enter our new fiscal year with momentum in our highest margin businesses and a strong operating model and improved market share. First, let me summarize our full year performance in a very difficult 2009. We had orders of $4.1 billion which were down 55% from 2008 and net sales of $5 billion which were down 38%. We reported a GAAP net loss of $305 million or $0.23 per share. We were profitable for the year on a non-GAAP basis earning $37 million or $0.03 per share.  We took early action on cost reductions and surpassed our objective of $400 million of structural cost savings by 15%. In addition, we have $340 million in annualized savings from temporary cost measures related to employee salary and variable compensation. Approximately 70% of those temporary savings were in op ex with the remainder in cost of goods. We began these temporary cost measures in the latter half of 2008 and approximately two thirds of those savings were already in effect by the end of Q4 ’08. Beginning in fiscal Q1 2010, we have eliminated shutdowns other than our normal holiday shutdowns and will resume accruing for variable compensation. This will result in an increase in Q1 op ex versus Q4 as the anticipated savings from our new actions will not fully offset these added costs until later in the program. We generated $333 million of operating cash flow in 2009 and ended the year with cash and investments of $3.3 billion.  Looking at our businesses in 2009, SSG and AGS revenue bottomed in our second fiscal quarter and both segments returned to operating profitability in the second half of the year. Revenue in our display business declined almost 50% from fiscal 2008 but its flexible business model limited operating losses to one quarter. Despite the severe business conditions, SSG, AGS and display each delivered positive operation margin overall in fiscal 2009. In the EES we grew revenue by 41% year-over-year led by customer acceptance of six SunFab lines. We invested to extend our crystalline silicon and thin film solar technologies and to expand our portfolio of new products. In EES we expect to move from a loss position of $240 million in 2009 to breakeven or better on an operating basis in 2010.  Looking at our Q4 results, orders were 37% higher sequentially led by EES and display. Net sales increased 35% driven by foundry customers and SSG a leading edge capacity expansion in display. The added revenue came with strong margin flow through contributing to earnings of $138 million or $0.10 per share. Our lower effective tax rate for the quarter of 21% contributed approximately $0.01 per share compared to Q3.  Gross margin improved eight points to 37% which is close to the 39% level achieved in Q4 of last year despite revenue being 25% lower. Our eight point sequential margin expansion was primarily driven by revenue growth in our higher margin businesses. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments of $3.3 billion were up 4% from Q3. Cash from operations was $241 million or 16% of revenue. Our working capital results were strong with days sales outstanding of 62 days and a net inventory reduction of $121 million compared to Q3 levels despite a substantial increase in net sales. Our ending backlog was $2.7 million down 7% from the previous quarter end. 41% of the backlog is now related to our EES business with display and SSG each at 20% and AGS at 19%. The low percentage of SSG backlog reflects our shorter cycle times and our ability to respond to our semiconductor customers short lead time on orders. In fact, our SSG turns business in Q4 was 61% of revenue in that segment. Backlog adjustments totaled $171 million and reflected the volatility of some of our customers’ investment plans. Backlog adjustments including $168 million in cancellations and $3 million of currency and other adjustments.  Next, I’ll summarize segment results for the quarter. Our silicon systems business performed very well. Orders increased 16% over Q3 at $629 million. Foundry customers were 37% of the order book and have led in that category for three consecutive quarters. SSG revenue increased 32% again, led by foundry along with strong demand from logic and memory customers. SSG operating profits were $158 million up substantially from Q3 and represented an impressive 24% of sales. In AGS orders increased 13% to $335 million and revenue increased 14% relative to Q3 to $390 million. Operating profit was $64 million or 17% of sales reflecting an accelerating recovery in spares sales. Display orders increased 58% to $151 million as robust end market demand fueled Gen 8.5 capacity investments. Revenue grew to $200 million as we signed up multiple leading edge systems. Display operating margins benefited from the revenue improvement reaching $43 million or 21% of revenue.  In EES, orders were $357 million up significantly from Q3 as a SunFab project in China entered our 12 month booking window. EES revenue of $280 million was up 25% driven by the sign off of a tandem junction SunFab line which offset a slight decline in crystalline silicon sales. EES posted an operating loss of $30 million, an improvement of more than 40% from Q3. Over half of the EES operating loss was attributable to M&A charges and non-solar R&D. EES’ quarterly results will continue to be volatile based on the timing of factory sign offs. Next, I’ll comment on our financial expectations for the strategic actions Mike announced earlier. Total savings from these actions are expected to be $450 million over the next 18 months of which we expect approximately $250 million to be from op ex. These actions will also include work force reductions of approximately 10% to 12% or 1,300 to 1,500 employees over the same period. The pre-tax cost from employee severance is expected to be between $100 million and $125 million and we are forecasting a $0.06 to $0.07 a share charge in the first quarter. Next, I’ll talk about some of the key assumptions behind our expectations for next sales to be up greater than 30% in fiscal 2010. Our forecast assumes that wafer fab equipment cap ex will be $18 to $20 billion for calendar year 2010. Display capital spending for equipment will be up at least 40% for the year. EES net sales are expected to be plus or minus 10% from 2009 levels. Solar growth is expected to be impacted by absorption of significant capacity additions in crystalline silicon over the past two years. Upside to this view would be driven by better than expected capacity additions in crystalline silicon and from new product penetrations. Finally, we expect that services will continue to recover although at a somewhat lower rate than the underlying equipment businesses. Now, before I discuss our Q1 guidance I want to review some housekeeping items that will take effect in our Q1. First, marketing and sales expenses that were previously reported in corporate will now be reported in the business segments. This is consistent with embedding our sales teams in our businesses.  Second, we’re moving the cost of certain segment related bonus accruals out of corporate and in to the segments for better visibility. Historically, we accrued target variable compensation in the segments and then took any adjustments in corporate. The third and final change is that we will no longer include stock option expenses in our reconciliation for non-GAAP results. Our GAAP results already reflect these costs so there is no net change. None of these changes will have a financial impact on the company’s financial results. Next, I’ll review our outlook for fiscal Q1. We see further recovery in our first quarter particularly in semiconductor capital equipment. We expect SSG revenue to be up by more than 20% due to strong investment in wafer fab equipment by foundry and memory customers. AGS is expected to grow modestly quarter-over-quarter. Display is still in a ramp mode although we expect Q1 net sales to be down relative to a very strong Q4. This is a timing issue as we had a major shipment pull in to Q4 ’09. We expect EES revenue to be up by more than 20% due to both factory and bonus sign off opportunities.  For Q1 we expect net sales overall to be up 10% to 25%. We expect earnings to improve to somewhere in the range of $0.10 and $0.14 per share before taking in to account the impact of restructuring charges. This improvement reflects the benefit of higher revenue and SSG, AGS and EES partially offset by the restoration of base salaries, the phasing in of variable compensation, a 14th week of cost in the quarter and a decline in display revenue relative to Q4. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 29% with a $0.01 negative impact relative to last quarter. The impact of the restructuring charge will be in the range of $0.06 to $0.07 per share which brings our GAAP EPS target for Q1 to between $0.04 and $0.08 per share.  Now Mike, let’s open the call for questions.
Michael Sullivan:  To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than brief follow up. Operator, let’s begin.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Stephen Chin – UBS.
Stephen Chin – UBS:  A question on the linearity for the fiscal 2010 sales, it looks like fiscal 2010 sales are pretty heavily front end loaded here with conservatism built in to the second half of the year. Is that the right way to think of it? And, just as a follow on, can you share any color on normalized operating margin targets after this restructuring?
Michael R. Splinter : I’ll try to answer your question on linearity Steven and then let George answer the question on targets. I think it’s very hard for us to tell what’s going to happen in the second half of the year at this point. I think we’re pleased to see what we perceive as strength in the first half of the year and have it be pretty broad based and particularly with upticks from foundries and DRAM makers. Now, how strong it will be in the second half, I really think that depends on how the market goes in the first half and how strong we think the economy is as we head in to selling season next year.
George S. Davis : Steven, on the margins I would say that we still see 2010 as a period of recovery. We obviously are very pleased with the structural changes that we have made in our cost structure over the past two years we think that’s going to serve our business model well and when we get back in to a normalized environment we certainly expect to be back at the 20% to 25% plus margins for the company overall. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from James Covello – Goldman Sachs.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: I guess if I could focus first on silicon systems group and of the top 10 customers in SSG, with the guidance that you gave for the first quarter, how would you characterize the top10 customers? Are most of them active now, are half of them active or only a few of them active again, kind of thinking about the top 10?
Michael R. Splinter : Most of them are active now to some degree. I would say the top five are certainly very active and account for a big part, certainly substantially more than 50% of the revenue in SSG.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: Do you think they can continue to grow or would you expect them to stay at that higher level and further growth be dependent upon the rest of the top 10 and beyond the top 10 coming in?
Michael R. Splinter : I think really the issue is when do the memory guys get in the capacity expansion? Today, it’s primarily technology transition and that’s about all we’re seeing out of the memory guys. Just to kind of give you an idea, we estimate something close to a million memory wafers are going to move from one node to the next. That combines DRAM and NAN. While we’ll have maybe 10% of that number in capacity expansions so we’ve got to see bit growth higher than it is in both DRAM and NAN to really drive some substantial additional capacity expansion.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: George, how should we think about the pace of the cost reduction in fiscal 2010? And, why did you not guide EPS also for fiscal 2010?
George S. Davis : I think we’re very confident that earnings will be up strongly in line with the growth in revenues. So, we certainly feel good about the earnings outlook for 2010. We think there’s a lot of mix issues that still have to be sorted out over time. We’ll certainly update our views and help people sort that through but in general I think people can see that over the past year and really two years, we’ve taken substantial structural costs out so as you model the growth rates and we’re saying significant growth rates in display and SSG over that time period there will be a lot of earnings leverage to the upside in 2010.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: On EES, the last time you provide the guidance for breakeven or better in solar you had not yet announced the restructuring. Now that you have and also the run rate in EES is clearly higher than your billion dollar guidance for fiscal 2010, why not a better profitability target in the EES?
George S. Davis : We think that this is the right forecast for EES right now. As we said, there’s still some uncertainty in their end markets because of what we’re seeing in the crystalline silicon area so we think breakeven or better operating is still the right forecast.
Operator:  Your next question comes from C. J. Muse – Barclays Capital.
C. J. Muse – Barclays Capital: I guess the first question is just to clarify in terms of EES breakeven or better in fiscal ’10, George you’re talking about operating levels so I guess if we want to think about it on a GAAP basis excluding stock comp and the amortization on the M&A side, what kind of run rate could we see?
George S. Davis : When we say operating basis remember going forward that we’re not going to include stock ops in expenses so you don’t have to adjust for that. Really, we’re talking about approximately $50 million of M&A related charges that we expect to see in 2010 that we would take out.
C. J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Then just if I could clarify also, on the EPS guidance of $0.10 to $0.14, does that include stock-based comp?
George S. Davis : Yes, it includes everything accept for the restructuring charges. 
C. J. Muse – Barclays Capital:  Then I guess the meaty question on the restructuring side, how should we think about I guess the base level? You’ve talked about op ex lower over 18 months by about $62 million plus, COGS by $50 million. I guess what’s the kind of baseline rate we should think of as a starting point and then see the reductions thereafter?
George S. Davis : I think ongoing op ex coming out of FY ’09 was about $1.6 billion and you had roughly $50 or $60 million of what we would call temporary op ex in there so if you adjust for that that is a reasonable starting point. Again, we took out in the plan last year, we took about $310 million of what I would call structural op ex costs and so roughly $80 million a quarter came out of our run rate.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Chris Ransick] – JP Morgan.
[Chris Ransick] – JP Morgan: I wanted to kind of get an idea of how long it’s going to take for you to start capitalizing on the purchase of Advent Solar?
Michael R. Splinter : I think that will really be 2011 before we see real meaningful sales from that technology. We need to finish up the development of the capability and then get it in to the marketplace. So, I think before we see meaningful output is 2011.
[Chris Ransick] – JP Morgan: Then kind of again on solar, I think Mike you indicated you thought volume growth our install capacity for solar would be up more than 40% in the next year. I wanted to understand your view of the German subsidy reduction risk when you put that number out there?
Michael R. Splinter : I think this risk has been overblown. I believe that when you look at what will happen in Germany next year, I think it will be flat to up and then increases in Italy, China and the US will drive the rest of the upside.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: You guys mentioned that the foundries have been a big contributor to the Silicon strength in the last three quarters and 37% foundry orders is probably the highest we have seen for Applied in a long time. [Inaudible] spending at $1 billion, $1.2 billion [inaudible] so my question is if foundries trend starts to come down in the first half and memory capacity orders are not back, could we see a scenario where we could see overall orders start to come down in first half?
Michael R. Splinter : Our view of what’s going to happen with the foundry spending and kind of maybe a little bit more color on the overall capital spending, we think foundries for the year, we made a projection of $18 to $20, we think foundries are going to be between 25% and 35% of that number. Exactly how it’s going to be loaded I really can’t quite say yet. But, when we look at the number of customers that are going to reach the billion dollar range, in 2009 I think there were three customers that reached $1 billion in cap ex, we think there will be at least eight in 2010 and we do think, as I said, if there’s more bit growth there can be substantial investment in capacity. But, we have to see that bit growth first.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: A couple of things, first of all George does the $450 million in savings, does that cannibalize any of your current revenue or is that just straight savings? 
George S. Davis : Now, we’re taking cost savings that we think will not interfere with our ability to drive revenue growth. These are really structural changes that will take place over time as we go through many of the elements which Mike talked about which includes moving sales in to the businesses, consolidating our field resources as our customer bases change, global manufacturing and supply chain consolidation and movement, more manufacturing and supply chain activity in Asia which has a lot of cycle time and cost benefits. So, all the things that we talked about really we think are a combination of better competitive positioning and also more efficient not from reducing or selling off a product that is generating revenue.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: As a follow up, the last two quarters you’ve worked off backlog a bit, you’ve booked a bit less than you’ve revenued and I’m wondering if I take sort of a midpoint of the revenue guidance, roughly $1.8 billion do you think the same thing is going to fiscal Q1 i.e. you’re going to book less than you will revenue or will you book more?
George S. Davis : Not guiding, we do expect to [inaudible] to be up but we’re not going to guide orders. But, that is one of the best ways of backing in to it that I’ve seen so a good question.
Michael R. Splinter : Tim on the overall restructuring I’d just say that we really tried to go through every aspect of the way we do business and ask ourselves how we’re doing it, how we could do it more efficiently, are we doing it in the right place, if we’re not how do we get to the right place for doing that. That’s really what the number reflects and what both the headcount and the savings number reflect.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Kirsh Sankar – Banc of America Merrill Lynch.
Kirsh Sankar – Banc of America Merrill Lynch: Two questions, actually a question and a follow up. First one, lead time in the SSG business how are they right now in 4Q and 1Q and any visibility beyond the Jan quarter? My follow up question is once the cost reductions are done, how do we think of the incremental margin for the company and if possible segment by segment?
Michael R. Splinter : I think lead times have shrunk quite a bit. We’re putting a bit of stress on our supply chain right now. Our suppliers are responding, they’re working very closely with us. But, as George said 61% of our revenue in Q4 was orders within the quarter so you kind of get an idea we’re moving products to customers very, very quickly. George, do you want to comment on incremental flow through of profits?
George S. Davis : I think you saw very high flow through this quarter. It gives you an idea of how we’re already impacting our performance from the actions that we’ve taken to date. We certainly see an additional $450 will have a positive impact. These actions are broad based, they cut across the company so they will positively impact every units margins and at the annual analyst meeting we will go in to more details about how you can see that overtime.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Steve O’Rourke – Deutsche Bank.
Steve O’Rourke – Deutsche Bank: Two questions, could you say if the headcount reduction is net of new headcount that you’ll be adding in Asia and the second question, you mentioned that the SunFab line, the bookings, came within the 12 month time horizon. Are those rebookings and do you feel confident that they may push out or not push out further?
George S. Davis : On the headcount yes, those are net numbers. Then in terms of the 12 month booking window, the way we book SunFab lines is we may sign a contract but because the lead times are longer than our 12 month booking window we actually wait until we get to within 12 months of what we believe will be factory sign up which is the revenue event and that’s what’s happened now with this so there’s no rebooking at all. We just are now within 12 months of what we believe will be the revenue event.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Peter Rice – Global Crown].
[Peter Rice – Global Crown]: Mike, I was hoping you could comment, across the board it seems some of the equipment companies are taking a more defensive posture despite kind of going in to a cyclical recovery, cutting heads, cutting costs, what’s different in this upturn that’s allowing the customers to support this? As the follow up, I was hoping you could comment in the second half of the year the recovery has largely been driven by technology spending. I was hoping you could share kind of your outlook for when the next phase of new fabs will be built out and what customer segments will be driving this initial recovery?
Michael R. Splinter : Peter I think the view of the future is different than other recoveries. This particular recovery, and I would say we certainly haven’t recovered yet, is one that the environment is quite different. We still have a very fragile global economy, we have a customer base that is consolidated substantially and I think will continue to consolidate some as we go through time. We have to ensure that our cost structure and our ability to invest for the future is really intact and that’s a big part of what we are doing and we also have to align the financials and pro form for any of our groups to be consistent with the way we see the market.  So, I think that’s pretty much – it sort of gets down to really a focus if we look at AGS and SSG, in AGS 25% of the 200 millimeter wafers are gone, they’re not coming back. So, we have to ensure that AGS is set up to be profitable and effective at growing share but also be realistic about the market they’re serving. The same as in SSG. I think when do new fabs get moving again, I really think that depends. First of all, I don’t know that we’ll see new buildings before late in 2010 but there’s plenty of space to fill up for the foreseeable future in both memory and in foundry. I think 2010 is going to be a year of filling up existing fabs.  But also, I think we’re looking for those inflection points primarily in memory that are going to key them to say, “Okay, we have confidence to build capacity.” What we think those are is DRAM bit growth greater than 50% and we’re hoping and want to watch this very carefully that investments from industry and emergence of Windows 7 and growth in cell phones really does drive that bit growth in DRAMs. In NAN flash we have to see bit growth above 100% and maybe even substantially above 100%. Again, that will be SmartPhones and MP3 players and the like that drive the flash bit capacity. We’ll see SSDs also but that’s not going to be a big mover this year. Maybe in 2011 it will be the next phase of this build out.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Patrick Ho – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Patrick Ho – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: I know you didn’t give any quantitative guidance to orders but can you discuss which customer segment will drive orders or at least on the semi side of things in the January quarter? Is it going to be memory that takes the lead or will you still see foundries comprising your largest percentage?
George S. Davis : We think foundries will continue to be strong but it’s really we think DRAM is going to be the big driver in Q1.
Patrick Ho – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: The second question is in terms of the cash generation now that you’re starting to put together as you’re making money again, what do you plan to do with it? Are you going to plan to sit on the sidelines or are you going to reinitiate stock buyback like you did in the last up cycle?
George S. Davis : We still believe that share repurchases is the best way of returning excess cash flow so we will begin to share repurchase again as soon as we’re comfortable that things have stabilized in the economy, we get more than just one or two strong quarters of cash flow. I think our view of how much cash we would hold is probably a little bit higher than we had going in to the year 2009 although we feel we’re in a very strong position right now. We want to see a little more continuity in the economic recovery but we’re still a believer in share repurchase. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: I just wanted to dig in to the EES group a little bit. You talked about expanding your tam, you mentioned it as one of the key growth opportunities over the next several years yet you guided revenue flat for 2010 with 2009 plus or minus 10% so I’m just wondering when do you expect the growth to come and what would be the key catalyst to look for?
Michael R. Splinter : I think we’re quite excited about this space in particular but during those comments I was referring to crystalline silicon and we’re coming out with a number of new products there that should expand our tam. What we’re concerned about right now is wafering and how fast wafering expansion is going to occur and that’s really what we look for is as wafering orders start to come in we know that the cell orders aren’t far behind because those wafers have to go to a manufacturing line someplace. That’s our caution side, if we see that grow I think we’re going to have a very good year in crystalline silicon.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: With a $50 million in M&A charges is that for acquisitions you’ve already made or should we expect more perhaps on the crystalline silicon side in 2010?
George S. Davis : That’s for acquisitions that we’ve already made.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Within the context of the EES revenue guidance for next fiscal year plus or minus 10%, I’m just wondering what your assumptions are for project sign offs, particularly what is the total [inaudible] interest of project sign offs in fiscal ’09 and on average what’s the megawatt size on those sign offs and what’s embedded in your expectations in terms of the flat plus or minus 10% guidance for EES as a whole next year in terms of project sign offs, the number and average megawatt size? I’m got a follow up as well.
George S. Davis : We certainly have at least three to four more factories to be signed off in that forecast. We also expect a certain number of bonuses to potentially be paid during that time period. I’m not going to go in to the details on the megawatts but we have again, I would say certainly the largest factory will be coming in the latter part of the year that we have.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: My follow up question is just about some of the reorganization that’s been happening. I jumped on the call late but I wanted to understand whether or not there’s any structural reorganization specific to etch and inspection that really might help you kind of reenergize the effort in terms of regrowing the market share specifically in etch and I guess to a lesser extent in inspection since you’ve made some headway there already?
Michael R. Splinter : We’re not announcing any organizational shifts today in those groups. We just, a couple of months ago, Randhir Thakur took over as a General Manager of SSG and he’s working very closely with customers and making sure they understand our technology roadmap and have renewed confidence in our direction.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini – Freidman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.
Mehdi Hosseini – Freidman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: The first question has to do with the EES, have you done any study to find out the kind of estimated megawatt of installations that your SunFab customers could be manufacturing for especially over the next 12 months? Then George, regarding the January quarter, given such a wide delta in the guidance range, help me understand what would it take to hit the low end versus the high end of revenue guidance range?
Michael R. Splinter : On the megawatt installations since this is output from customer factories it’s very hard for me to comment but obviously the top side is their rated capacity and other than that I can’t say a whole lot. There’s been announcements about the rated capacity of each of those factories.
George S. Davis : I think the range reflects the range that we gave on revenue and I think that if you think about the low end so if for some reason revenue grew at the low end, remember we have about $0.02 to $0.03 of cost in op ex in Q1 that we didn’t have in Q4 and the tax rate impact is about $0.01 as well. So, the low end of that range is probably not as a low performance straight up comparison wise as you might consider.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Edwin Mok – Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok – Needham & Company: The first question is on the backlog, you said $116 million of cancellation, can you tell us where that cancellation comes from in terms of which group and how do we look at that going forward? Is that something that we should expect ongoing? Then just a follow up question regarding your strategy initiative, I was just wondering the guidance of $450 million of savings does that include the potential savings you can get from transitioning your manufacturing to Singapore and if not, how much will that incrementally be on top of that $450?
George S. Davis : I’ll take your second question first, the $450 does include benefits associated with that activity over the next 18 months. Then in terms of the backlog adjustments, what we’re seeing is I would say about $90 million of the cancellations were in our SSG group and really just reflect the fact that customers’ plans have been changing fairly substantially and as we talked about their order patterns are shortening up substantially. But, we’re now down to about 20% of our backlog is SSG so not a lot of volatility going forward. The rest of it is between AGS and EES, with EES mostly centered around crystalline silicon customers around the world.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Just another question on op ex, if you look at the temporary savings you had $350 million, 70% of the op came from op ex so that’s pretty much offset by the $250 million savings you’re going to get from restructuring. Just looking at the profile it looks like temporary savings come back faster and the restructuring will come slower so op ex will increase and then towards the end of the year the impact we come back to starting point. Is that the right way to think it?
George S. Davis : I think that’s a fair way to look at it and we’ll give you an update every quarter on our progress which should help you tune your model over time.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Just one quick one, so your SG&A went down significantly from $168 to $155 and you’re saying that was a onetime thing and it goes back to $168 or higher level?
George S. Davis : Again, part of what you’ll see with part of the restructuring is SG&A will improve over time as part of the actions that we’re taking. I think the way to think about it is as revenues increases you’ll see more and more flow through because the temporary costs will come back at a slower rate after we see further recovery.
Operator:  Your next question comes from [Agadesh Ire – Argus Research].
[Agadesh Ire – Argus Research]: Two questions, one is how should we think about this Advent Solar acquisition in terms of your incremental revenue opportunities going in to say 2011 because it looks like it’s a very disruptive technology so how should we think about that? The second question as a follow up is we’ve been hearing that logic and foundry customers are pursuing a double patterning stream of litho etch litho [inaudible]. How does the dynamics change because you guys have been pushing the self aligned double patterning? Can you just help us understand the dynamics please?
Michael R. Splinter : Well, on Advent first of all it’s way too early to make a forecast. We obviously very much like the technology, we do think it’s a disruptive technology but we have to prove its manufacturability and cost effectiveness and that’s what we’re going to be doing over the coming quarters. As we get closer to introducing that as a capability to the marketplace we’ll update you on how we think it’s going to change the fabrication of solar panels.  On the litho etch litho [inaudible] self aligned double patterning I don’t think there’s a whole lot of difference for us. We still win in the thing film depositions and there’s going to be a mix of these things and it’s hard to exactly tell how it’s all going to shake out litho etch litho [inaudible] obviously better for logic and self aligned may be better for flash memory. But, I think we’re going to see how the adoption rate goes over the next year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Matthew Petkun – D. A. Davidson & Co.
Matthew Petkun – D. A. Davidson & Co.: A couple of questions, first on the consolidation of the supply chain and manufacturing, I just want to be clear, you expect to net increase or decrease your use of outside partners or could we actually see an increase in your own vertical integration over the next 12 months?
Michael R. Splinter : I don’t think you’ll be seeing an increase in our vertical integration. I think what we want to do is looking across our supply chain we want to ensure that we’re working with the suppliers that both have the right technology and can stay with us in this very volatile business. We’re going to be doing an awful lot of that in Asia as Singapore ramps up and for semiconductors and Taiwan ramps up for our large footprint equipment. But certainly we’re looking to make, in this kind of a business, we’re looking to make ourselves more variable and have more variable costs not less.
Matthew Petkun – D. A. Davidson & Co.: Then the display business has been strong, any update on your opportunity in the LED market as it relates to back lighting for displays?
Michael R. Splinter : Well, we’re in the latter stages of developing a product for that market. I had a lot of discussions with customers on what they want and what they need. We’re working very closely with a number of customers. We have some eval tools out there today. We haven’t introduced the product yet but we think we’ll participate in this market in a meaningful way.
Michael Sullivan:  What I would like to do is thank everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call.

Michael Splinter: Thanks Mike and welcome everyone to the call. Last quarter we outlined encouraging signs in the global economy and in our customers’ end markets. Today there are more indications that demand is growing and for the first time in a long while we see positive trends in our business. Economic decline in the U.S., Europe and Japan appears to be moderating. In China GDP is now growing by about 8% with government stimulus driving increased demand for semiconductors, flat panel displays and solar cells. This quarter our financial results improved in almost every category and we are seeing order growth following the steep declines of the first half of our fiscal year. We now believe the pickup in wafer fab equipment will be followed by a ramp of display orders over the next few quarters. We also expect solar fundamentals to improve over the next 12 months and we see potential for a larger upturn in wafer fab equipment next year.  While encouraged, we are clearly building off of a small base and it is too soon to conclude that a broad based recovery is at hand. We are maintaining our cost reduction programs and preserving our financial strength while investing to ensure our position as the number one equipment supplier to the semiconductor, display and solar PV industries.  Moreover, we believe this is the right time to consider the lasting changes the unprecedented downturn has made in the industries we serve. Our long range strategic planning is now underway and our focus is to align our products, cost structure and capabilities with market opportunities to deliver outstanding profitability. We expect to complete our analysis over the next few months and incorporate these changes in our operating plan for fiscal 2010.  Next I will comment more specifically on our industries and business segments. In semiconductors we were encouraged to see IC demand improve over 15% in revenue and over 25% in units in the second calendar quarter. Across the industry average utilization improved to about 75%. Foundries benefited from a doubling in wafer shipments.  DRAM experienced stronger ASP’s on a bit shipment growth of about 9% year-over-year. We believe that by the end of 2010 the DRAM industry will need to transition fully to DDR3 and this will create a served market opportunity of about $2 billion for Applied Materials. Nan bit growth was about 36% year-over-year driven primarily by Smart Phones and portable media players. For calendar 2009 Applied has raised its wafer fab equipment spending estimate from a previous range of $8-11 billion to a new range of $10-12 billion.  Our silicon systems group’s performance exceeded expectations. While calendar 2009 is clearly a year of depressed wafer fab equipment spending, we do expect to gain share virtually across the board. Positive trends for us include the adoption of emersion lithography, advanced transistors and the memory conversion to copper. Leading logic customers are doubling the number of selected [epi] steps and moving to gate last structures. While emersion lithography users need more advanced mask and wafer inspection techniques.  During the quarter we saw investments by leading edge foundries that favor our CVD and PVD solutions increasing our share leadership and process extensibility to the 3X node. In etch we expect to hold share in 2009 and based on our customer footprint we have achieved repeat buys this quarter in double patterning etch.  In applied global services our silicon service and spares business was up modestly. While factory utilization rates were higher we have seen customer consolidation and a significant amount of 200 mm capacity being taken offline. As a result, wafer starts among our semiconductor customers are down about 30% from a year ago which is limiting growth. Over the next few quarters we expect moderate improvement in applied service opportunity driven primarily by increased wafer starts.  In display a number of leading edge customers are now operating fabs above 90% utilization and the industry’s outlook for profitability has improved. Panel ASPs grew about 15% from their trough in the spring of this year. Global LCD TV unit demand is expected to increase over 20% in 2009 with growth driven primarily in China and the U.S. During the quarter we saw the bulk of investment coming from Chinese panel makers at Gen 6 which is suited for 32” TV’s. In the second half of calendar 2009 we expect the next phase of the Gen 8.5 build out to begin. In this cycle we expect our pivot PVD share to grow from single digits at one leading customer to more than 20 points at three or more customers.  Turning to solar, strength in the Chinese market, feed in tariff support in Italy, Greece and France and modest growth in the U.S. are offsetting some of the cut backs in Spain. From today’s level we expect annual PV solar installations to grow at a 30% compound rate with China poised to grow at twice the rate of the industry. In 2010 we estimate more than 4 gigawatts of capacity will be added.  In crystalline silicon, polysilicon prices are flattening and module prices are falling. In China and Taiwan utilization at major manufacturers rose to the 80-100% range. In this environment, customers need to improve module efficiency, reduce materials usage and achieve greater economies of scale. Applied’s products are providing that differentiation.  As a result of the momentum of our crystalline silicon solar equipment has been stronger than anticipated. Our new MaxEdge wafering system achieved first sign off at a major Chinese customer and we are in the process of shipping 55 wafering systems to another major customer in the region.  In thin film we have talked about 2009 being a year to improve operational efficiency as SunFab sites move up the learning curve. We are now seeing factory start ups in half the original time and are rolling significant cost material reductions out to customers. We have demonstrated 8.6% stable modules at tandem junction customers and achieved 10% stable modules in the lab. During the quarter we achieved factory sign off at a sixth SunFab customer whose modules are targeted for European utilities.  Tandem junction SunFab panels are now entering the market with over a megawatt of modules already installed. While new SunFab projects are still being held back by project financing and market obstacles, we are engaged with a number of new manufacturers and with single junction customers who are exploring the timing of tandem junction upgrades. One upside development in EES this quarter was an order to supply transparent conductive oxide systems to a major glass supplier to the solar industry.  Before I hand the call over to George I would like to observe that Applied delivered a solid third quarter including a number of key accomplishments in each of our businesses. As a company we have done a good job navigating this economic downturn and I would like to thank all of our employees for staying focused and doing their part to support our customers and exceed our goals.  Now let me pass the call on to George who will share our financial results and targets. George?
George Davis :  Thank you Mike. Good afternoon to everyone on the call today. Applied Material’s performance for the third quarter exceeded our targets for revenue and earnings per share. Directionally the quarter unfolded much as we expected with order and revenue growth up off the bottom in our semiconductor and services businesses and revenue declines in display and solar.  Semiconductor equipment was the biggest contributor to our performance as we experience a strong surge in revenue and orders during the second half of the quarter. While overall sales for Applied remained well below historical levels, our cost initiatives and other efficiency actions led to earnings break even on a non-GAAP basis and positive  cash from operations of $194 million.  Now we will go into some more detail on our results. For the quarter we reported a GAAP loss of $55 million or $0.04 per share. The $0.15 improvement from our Q2 reflecting higher revenue and gross margins along with lower charges from impairments, restructuring and severance and the absence of bad debt provisions.  Gross margin improved 13 points to 29% which shows the margin leverage associated with SSG revenue growth. Factory absorption improved on higher units and we had lower inventory write offs. Operating expenses were lower by $47 million as restructuring and other charges taken in Q2 rolled off this quarter and we generated additional savings from our cost reduction program announced in November.  Year-over-year operating expenses excluding restructuring, M&A charges and equity expensing were down by $107 million reflecting both permanent and temporary cost savings activities.  Let me take a moment to summarize the results against our cost initiatives. Last November we set a goal to lower our non-GAAP earnings breakeven point to $1.2 billion in quarterly revenue and our operating cash break even to $1 billion. Clearly we operated ahead of those goals in Q3. We raised our cost saving objective last quarter to $460 million and that will be fully reflected in our Q4 2009 run rate.  Our early and significant actions in cost management have allowed us to maintain R&D investments in our key markets and fund a major expansion into the energy space while delivering strong financial performance during a difficult time. We continue to look at how we can architect the company to adapt to changes in our major end markets and to reduce or eliminate our reliance on temporary cost measures such as shut downs, bonus eliminations and other pay cuts.  Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and investments balance of $3.1 billion was up quarter-over-quarter by $64 million. We paid dividends of $80 million and had capital spending of $60 million. Cash from operations was 17% of revenue while investing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars or 21% of revenue on R&D. Strict working capital discipline was a key factor in this performance. Day sales outstanding improved from 82 days to 68 and we lowered inventory by $150 million most notably in SSG and AGS. I would like to thank employees throughout our company for their dedication to working capital management.  Our backlog at quarter end was $3 billion down from $3.2 billion at the end of Q2. 36% of the backlog is related to our EES business and the remainder is about evenly split between silicon, services and display. Backlog adjustments totaled $141 million and included $146 million in cancellations and $51 million of de-bookings partially offset by currency and other adjustments of $55 million. The cancellations were primarily related to semiconductor memory and foundry customers with the biggest impact from memory customers changing their investment strategy to push orders for more advanced nodes in response to competitive requirements.  The de-bookings primarily reflect AGS and EES orders that have not been cancelled but are now expected to be realized outside of our 12-month bookings window.  Now I would like to review our segment results. Silicon systems had a very strong quarter on several fronts including orders and revenue growth and outstanding working capital management in a turn’s environment. Orders of $542 million more than doubled from Q2. Orders by semiconductor type can be found in our earnings release but nearly 70% came from foundry and DRAM customers.  SSG revenue was $498 million, up 91% sequentially and well ahead of our expectations of flat to up 40%. SSG’s manufacturing team was able to deliver approximately 60% of the revenue in the quarter on a turn’s basis. The last month of the fiscal quarter was particularly strong for SSG both in orders and revenue, a month that competitors will reflect in their September quarter results.  SSG’s operating profits were $56 million or 11% of sales which demonstrates the benefit of our operational changes and cost reduction actions. Looking forward, leading customers are continuing to rely on short-cycle ordering which results in limited visibility beyond the current quarter. Customer concentration in orders and revenue remains very high and a change in plans by any one of the leading customers could have a material impact on any given quarter.  In AGS orders were up 26% sequentially to $298 million reflecting higher factor utilization and spares demand. Revenue of $343 million was up 7% sequentially due primarily to higher silicon spares revenue which was offset by lower revenue from other services. Operating profit was $24 million or 7% of sales.  Display orders increased to $96 million after bottoming at $13 million in Q2. We see display customers beginning to accelerate their Gen 8.5 investments in response to strong consumer demand.  Revenue decreased as expected with sales of $69 million including our first Gen 10 system revenue. While revenue for display was the lowest since the second quarter of fiscal 2002, our highly outsourced operational model for that business resulted in only a modest loss.  In EES orders of $135 million were down 4% from Q2 as solar customers are still faced with difficult market conditions and a tight credit environment. We are seeing strong demand for our new wafering products particularly from China. EES revenue was down 37% from Q2 to $224 million. Crystalline silicon revenue declined in line with the industry while SunFab revenue reflected our sixth customer sign off.  EES revenue over the first three quarters of fiscal 2009 is already more than $50 million above total EES revenue for fiscal 2008 despite challenges in the end markets. EES had an operating loss of $53 million or 24% of sales. Excluding M&A charges, the crystalline silicon business was operating margin positive for Q3 and has been for every quarter of this year. Our latest SunFab factory sign off reflected cycle time and other learning curve performance improvements.  As a reminder, the EES operating loss includes R&D investments in solid state lighting and other energy and environment opportunities that represent both near-term and exploratory investments in broadening our growth portfolio in this space.  Now let me talk about our expectations for fiscal Q4. The economic and industry trends are generally more favorable than last quarter. Our customers remain cautious and are focused on near-term opportunities. Visibility beyond one to two months remains limited. We expect that a number of factors may cause customers to change their investment plans.  In particular, consumer behavior in the back to school and holiday selling seasons and changes in the global economic outlook and we are seeing an unusually high concentration of business in a small number of customers. As a result of all these factors, our target ranges will remain somewhat wide. While we are not giving a company target for orders we do expect growth in orders quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by higher display and EES orders.  We expect revenue to be up 10-20% in our fourth quarter led by display, SSG and AGS. We expect earnings to return to profitability in our fiscal Q4 and our EPS target to be within a range of break even to a positive $0.04 per share.  Now Mike let’s open the call for questions. 
Michael Sullivan :  Thanks George. To help us reach as many of you as we can please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Operator, let’s begin. 
 :
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of James Covello - Goldman Sachs. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Specific to the semi equipment business around the order composition. I know you are not giving specific order guidance but in terms of the number of customers for calendar Q3 and calendar Q4 do you see that broadening out at all in semi equipment or do you see the high level of concentration you saw in calendar Q2? 
George Davis :  We still see a very concentrated outlook. I think we will certainly be less foundry concentrated. Q3 was clearly dominated by foundry activity. We will see a few new players coming in. We expect Logic, for instance, to be a little bit stronger in Q4. In general it is still very concentrated. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Given that some customers are now off the [snide] so to speak, what do you think it would take to get the other customers? 
Michael Splinter :  I think the big thing is what is going to drive DRAM bit growth. I think we will see some flash start investment start to come back and we have already seen some foundry come back. As George mentioned, logic should perk up a little bit but I think the big thing is what is really going to drive DRAM bit growth. We can see DDR3 conversion as I mentioned in my prepared remarks as a big push but primarily that is a technology push as opposed to a capacity push. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin – UBS. 
Stephen Chin - UBS: A follow-up question on the display group orders if we look back we see that peak in the display orders in the prior cycle were about $500 million. Do you think we could see a higher peak in this display cycle since you have this [inaudible] tool? My follow-up question would be have you put systems in place that would allow display’s operating margin to be higher than the prior cycles and margins? 
Michael Splinter :  Maybe I can answer the first part of the question and George can answer the second part. I think the order pattern over the next few quarters is a little bit hard to predict but certainly we are gaining share with pivot. So if you integrate over the cycle we should do better assuming that overall investment let’s say over the next 12 months reaches $12 billion or so which was the total flat panel display capital investment during the last cycle. 
George Davis :  On operating margin I think there is no reason why we can’t get back to the more normalized 25-35% range that display operates in. On orders in general we were particularly peaky and lumpy in the last cycle. As Mike said it is going to be hard to know whether we see it that way and whether revenue is going to be as concentrated as well. If we get to a basic run rate of recovery we should see strong operating margins out of display. 
Michael Splinter :  One of the things we are seeing is we are really seeing a conversion of the Chinese TV market to flat panels, basically almost doubling the flat panel purchases in China and probably the bigger surprise there is the U.S. is up over 25% in flat panel purchases this year. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: If CapEx were to get back to the prior peak and AMAT’s revenues in the peak between $6-7 billion what type of restructuring can you do to get your operating margins? Can you get back to the prior peak operating margins of the high 20’s?
George Davis :  Yes. I think what we are seeing is the ability to drive operational improvements throughout the company. As you know initially we started with a strong refocusing of our portfolio. We have taken actions within the semiconductor group to really restructure that business. We are, as Mike said, taking a look at longer-term actions we can take in light of various scenarios that we see for our end markets over the next 2-3 years.  So there is no reason why we can’t operate at very similar operating margins going forward. You can already see in this quarter the tremendous improvement from the operational initiatives within SSG. At a very low level their gross margin was approximately 45% in Q3 which really reflects the kinds of earnings leverage that we are going to have as revenue comes back. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: On the memory front, clearly your foundry orders and logic orders are helping you a lot in July and [October]. Several memory customers of your have talked about a particularly unique improvement in capital efficiency as they shrink from the 5X node and go to the 3X and 4X. Given that and the lumpy nature of your current orders in October could you have some quarters that are non-linear as you go out beyond January? Could silicon orders be down, for example, in January? 
Michael Splinter :  Almost anything is possible. I think the information we are really looking for first of all is how does back to school sales flow through. If that is strong I think people will have confidence to build forward for Christmas and Chinese New Year. So that could carry us right through the end of the year and then it is how do they view the 2010 economy. If back to school is weak all bets are off. We are kind of looking for these next points of data as they become visible in the next 4-6 weeks. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities. 
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: As a quick follow-up, Mike I think you made a comment that you could potentially see a larger wafer fab equipment upturn next year. What kind of drives that view? How are you looking at next year from that perspective and what could happen between now and then? 
Michael Splinter : What drives that view is the economic recovery and consumers coming back in particular in Asia where we would expect to see continued growth in PC’s, Smart phones, media players and the beginning of adoption of solid state drives. So if semiconductor companies kind of get back up to closer that $250 billion run rate we think they are going to have to replace capacity that came off line because of consolidation or because 200 mm factories are no longer viable and some of that capacity will have to be replaced. That is really the thought process behind a more significant semi upturn sometime next year. 
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Were there any SunFab bookings in the quarter? 
George Davis :  We had bookings in the quarter related to bonuses as opposed to factories. 
Michael Splinter :  I think he is really asking contracts. 
George Davis:  Let me just clarify if you are asking were new contracts signed on new factories there were none signed in the quarter. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital. 
C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital: Can you help me reconcile your outlook for share gains across all segments with also you talk about realigning your cost structure? 
Michael Splinter :  Sure. I think our products right now are satisfying customer needs but when you boil it all down this is the way I would like for you to think about it. In etched, film and CMP we will hold or have modest gains. In our PVD, FEP and PDC segments we should have relatively significant gains. I think those are driven by some of the things I said in my comments but specifically in PVD the move to copper or at least for one layer in memory and sometimes two will have a positive effect on our PVD and then a move to more advanced transistors helps there also with the metal gate share that we have. Advanced transistors also helps our front end group at the end because of our millisecond and [yield] product. I think PDC has been well chronicled what progress we are making there. 
George Davis :  Let me just add something. I have seen this in a couple of comments; a connection between the idea of looking at our business for the long run and trying to really think about what the implications are of this economic restructuring or economic crisis we are all dealing with and looking at that in terms of what our cost structure should be going forward. We are seeing in our industry customer consolidation, higher capital efficiency, plus we have done things like making investments in enterprise systems that allow us to do things more efficiently. So we are really just looking at the architecture of the company and saying how can we continue down this path of operational and financial improvements given the fact that the world has changed somewhat. Now we are looking at different scenarios for how much the world has changed and what the scenario is but that is what is driving our analysis. It is not a market share issue. It is really prudent long-range planning. 
C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital: The EPS guidance you gave is that pro forma or GAAP? 
George Davis :  That is GAAP. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri – Citi. 
Timothy Arcuri - Citi: First of all George, on one hand you sound pretty bullish about next year but on the other hand you are also talking about a cost cutting program that you are going to get into in the next few quarters. I am wondering if you are so confident business was going to get that much better next year why would you embark upon a significant cost cutting program at this point? What the top or break even of the company should be. Then as a follow-up now that you have a megawatt of SunFab modules at customers that are actually installed I was wondering if you had any balance of systems data that you could share with us? 
Michael Splinter :  Maybe I can take the first part of this. George kind of touched on this a bit but what we are going through right now is a real fundamental look at first of all the markets that we serve and what has happened to them in this economic downturn. We think that they are fundamentally changed. We think as an industry, frankly, we have to adjust to the fundamental changes of the industry and both align our products with that and our investment with that. So this is really about how to be competitive and how to be focused in the markets that we want to play in.  This is as much an industry thing as it is an Applied thing. George maybe you want to talk about break even? 
George Davis :  As we said our goal was to get our break even this year down to about $1.2 billion a quarter. We clearly have done that. Again, I would just point you to the exercise we are going through is not a cost cutting exercise in the classical sense. This is a how should the company be structured given the fact that the customers and the markets that we serve are being restructured in response to what they have been facing over the last 12 months. That is really what our focus is. I think trying to turn this into it is a cost cutting issue driven by some operational issue in the company is missing the point.  We are very focused on continuous improvement and we are going to continue to look for opportunities to be more effective. 
Michael Sullivan:  I think he also had a question that was a balance issue? 
Michael Splinter :  It is pretty difficult for us to comment on what our customers are doing but the designs we have done internally pretty much verify our estimates of 15-20% improvement between big panels and smaller size panels. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley. 
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: On the utilization you gave a blended utilization number of 75%. I’m curious where you think NAN memory utilization is at and between NAN and DRAM would it be fair to say that the capacity you see in NAN before DRAM? Then I have a follow-up. 
Michael Splinter :  Maybe I can add a little bit of color to that. What we said was about 75 blended in calendar Q2 with NAN foundry and DRAM pretty much all in that same range. What we see progressing through the next quarter or so is both NAN and foundry most factories will be very full, 90% plus utilization while logic and DRAM will lag a little bit.  We see total utilization getting close to 90% blended to compare those numbers. 
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: On the display side I am curious given the high brightness LEDs and the growing trends for the display screens, I am curious if the strength you are seeing in display how much of it is conventional panels versus panels for high brightness LED and where you are in terms a bright panel LED development to target the market? 
Michael Splinter :  Most of the display demand is conventional TV’s. TV’s are driving it. 32” in China in particular is driving the increase in utilization in factories and some of the capacity adds. As far as the high brightness LED’s this is still a market penetration time. We think that will be much bigger next year, maybe 10-20% of the totals next year. We don’t have any real big announcements about our LED program internally other than we continue to look at unique capabilities we can add to customers that will give them differentiation and drive down cost and improve the performance of manufacturing LEDs. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar – BAS/MIL. 
Krish Sankar – BAS/MIL:  Last quarter you gave guidance for sales. You kind of gave some more incremental color on the different segments. Can you maybe break it down between the top 10-20% by display versus EES? 
Michael Splinter :  As we have said we think on the revenue side we think both AGS and display to be up. We expect silicon to kind of be up in line with the overall guidance. EES is probably the big swing factor and we will just see how that plays out. 
Krish Sankar – BAS/MIL:  Just to follow-up on the EES side do you have any expectations for how many SunFab [inaudible] revenue in October and in terms of July quarter if I assume about $100 million of the revenue came from SunFab. What percentage of it was the actual sign off and how much was the bonus? 
George Davis :  I’m not going to go to quite that much detail but we do expect to sign off an additional factory in Q4. We also expect to achieve at least one bonus pay off or sign off in Q4 as well. So we are basically continuing on the pace at the sign off schedule that we expected. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.: Some clarification on your orders outlook of being up. You mentioned the flat panel display as well as your solar business. Can you provide a bit of color in terms of the silicon systems? Is that going to also contribute to the orders outlook in October? 
George Davis :  I don’t see it having any big detrimental impact but orders were up over 100% in our Q3 and again we had a very strong last month of our quarter which the rest of the industry doesn’t see until their quarterly report in September. So we have seen a very big, if you average the two quarters I think it will look very good by industry standards. 
Michael Splinter :  The other thing we are dealing with right now is it is very much a turn’s environment and exactly how the end of September and October are going to turn out, we think our manufacturing and supply chain is in line to do whatever our customers need us to do over this next 3 month period. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.: In terms of the operational plan you are trying to set for fiscal 2010 is a lot of that just trying to make your overall operations more flexible and I guess adjustable to these kinds of swings we have seen where in future downturns you won’t see I guess the decline or the pressures on the business model that we saw this time around? 
George Davis :  I think we are just taking a look at how we can maintain a very strong competitive approach to the market but be more efficient in the way we do it. Those are the questions we are asking ourselves. We will look at different ways to organize parts of the company that will allow us to be more efficient. One of the things we have with multiple lines of business that a number of our competitors will struggle with and you can see it in their SG&A and other things is we have the ability to drive efficiencies and scale within the company. We want to make sure we are taking full advantage of that going forward. This is really part of ongoing, long-term continuous improvement and it is really not just about 2010. This is part of our three year plan. These are changes and initiatives we think will take place over the next few years and will have a very positive impact. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Just to get a better handle on what you are exactly saying about SSG orders in the October quarter, can we get the breakdown of SSG orders by DRAM, flash foundry, logic, and IDM in the July quarter or do you think that will be in the October quarter?  Just a second question, based on your cost structure here, I might have missed it but I am just wondering what exactly drove such good operational performance in the EES business? Revenue dropped around 40% but you actually improved in terms of your operating margins although it is still negative. If you could help me understand what the lever points are in terms of driving improved operating margin on the EES side. Is it crystalline silicon, cost reduction, distributing R&D somewhere? Just help me understand that number there. 
George Davis :  Let me start on the silicon orders by summarizing Q3 as a reference point to Q4. I’m not going to guide specifically because again on a turns environment trying to overly predict orders is going to be a little bit difficult. We had 25% DRAM, 15% flash, 18% logic and other and 42% foundry orders. That was our composition in Q3. We expect foundries to lighten up a bit proportionately just because they were so strong in the quarter. We actually think you will see logic increase as a percent in the fourth quarter.  Flash and DRAM there is some volatility around those numbers and they will determine exactly how the numbers come out. I wish I could be more specific but it is just not knowable beyond that level.  On EES operating margin what you are seeing is primarily that was the impact of the SunFab sign off and the improved margin relative to some of the learning curve improvements we are seeing in that space. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Christopher Blansett - J.P. Morgan. 
Christopher Blansett - J.P. Morgan: I had a quick question related to the SunFab customers. Obviously there is a lot of uncertainty in the solar side but one thing that is true is if you can get financing you can get projects put into Germany and some of the other countries in Europe. I wasn’t sure if you had thought about putting a program together to help your specific SunFab customers initially finance some of the projects to help them grow their own businesses. 
George Davis :  We have been pretty clear that we are not a bank and we don’t operate effectively as a bank. We are certainly willing to work with our customers and help make their project as financeable as possible. If a project is not financeable primarily on its own merits we don’t think it makes sense for us to play that role. I think vendor finance of that nature has been problematic for many years. 
Christopher Blansett - J.P. Morgan: Related to your cost of goods sold could you give a little more clarity on your cost of goods actually declined even though your revenue increased? Just kind of give a little description of what caused that. 
George Davis :  That was a mix issue. Silicon was the primary, again it is a mix issue where you have a higher margin business taking a larger share of our overall pool. It is that effect. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini - FBR Capital Markets
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR Capital Markets: You talked about signing up another system fab in the October quarter. Can you help us understand what is the average size of these fabs or SunFabs that you signed off?
George Davis :  The factories are all different sizes. So any one quarter you can get a very different outcome. We are expecting one of the smaller factories to sign off in Q4. 
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR Capital Markets: For EES to drive up booking in the October quarter that means something has to be of a significant size? 
George Davis :  We are confusing orders and revenue. The orders we say EES is going to contribute to will be for items that will be revenued within a year of Q4 2009. When we talk about sign off, which is FAT (factory acceptance) maybe that wasn’t clear enough. My apologies for that. The sign off we expect to be in Q4 will be a revenue event for the company. 
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR Capital Markets: To the extent the bookings in the October quarter could be up driven by the EES could you help us understand what is going to be the mix between [inaudible] and the [cush] line? 
George Davis :  I am not going to go to that level of granularity right now. What I said was we know that display and AGS are going to be clear drivers and that EES will be a swing factor and part of that will be what things are booked and the mix of that. Those numbers, there is a fair amount of volatility in those numbers. We are not able to guide on that. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Peter Wright – Global Crown Research. 
Peter Wright – Global Crown Research: If you could help comment and give us some clarity on capacity growth in 2009 in terms of kind of $11 billion of wafer fab equipment spend what we can expect kind of gross capacity growth to be and with 200 mm coming off line if you could give us some perspective of where you think actually net capacity growth could be for the year. My second question is kind of clarity on the fixed versus variable costs of your business. It looks like very reliably your silicon business and your display business you have been able to get the cost down to roughly kind of 1/3 of what a normalized rate or a one-quarter average run rate would be. How should we think of your EES business? Should we think of it in the same way you will be able to manage that and if so do you think you are going to be growing your way into that $4 billion-ish number over the next 2-3 years? That seems like it is fairly tough and what type of cost cuts have to happen in that segment?  
Michael Splinter :  When you look at the kind of investments that anywhere that is in our range, most if not almost all is technology transition investments and not capacity investments. If you just look inside of the companies who have taken factories off line, 200 mm coming off line and a small amount of capacity coming online we think the net on wafers is going to be down about 15% this year. 
George Davis :  On EES, first off welcome back. It is good to hear your voice. On EES the way I would think about EES and the way I would differentiate it from our other businesses is that it is really in the investment phase. This is addressing a series of markets which we think look like very attractive growth businesses. The cost structure there reflects the fact that we are still investing heavily in the initial positioning of SunFab. We are investing in that area to get the 10% efficiency by year-end. We are not at a run rate level as we will be over time in that space.  In crystalline silicon we are continuing to expand our product portfolio that supports that market. We already have two strong, as you know, product positions there but there is a lot of opportunities for us to address other critical issues for customers. So we have product investments in that as well.  I think the focus there is investment and new product penetration and we will continue to talk about that over time. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok - Needham & Company. 
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: A question on the crystalline silicon side of your solar business, you mentioned that you were shipping I think you said 50 equipment to a customer, wafering equipment to a customer. I was wondering if that customer or those customers are they adding new capacity or just converting their lines in order to enable this in their wafers or high [frequent] equipment? 
Michael Splinter :  What we are seeing particularly in China is the addition of new capacity. The opportunities are increasing and seem to be quite aggressive in the wafer space but this is all new wafering capacity. 
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: A follow-up for George. I noticed that your unallocated costs have gone up based on your reported numbers. I was wondering is that just a one-quarter event and how do we look at that going forward? Also if you can help remind us how much temporary savings did you have in the last quarter? 
George Davis :  Unallocated costs is a temporary item. It is down significantly year-over-year so we will see that continue to trend downward over time. We have some severance charges that are in there and some one-time adjustments. In terms of our temporary cost reductions, I will just remind everybody we have had temporary cost reductions in place now for some period of time and in fact were running at about $80 million if you look at the reduction in base bonus levels and the impact of shut downs and other pay cuts on our costs for salaries. So about $320 million annualized but if you look back a year we are probably net/net only $26 million down on those temporary expenses because we had already cut back on bonuses and had already began shut downs because we were in the middle of a SSG downturn last year. So this has been a long and difficult time and our employees have just been unbelievably supportive and responsive throughout this time period. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sangareria - RBC Capital Markets. 
Mahesh Sangareria - RBC Capital Markets: I just want to follow-up on the comment on operating expenses. If you can help us work through I think the temporary cost comes up in October. How does R&D which was 234 for the last quarter and marketing and SG&A was 168. How will that trend? Some help on that would be good. 
George Davis :  R&D has been remarkably resilient intentionally because we are trying to do whatever we can to reduce costs in all other places of the company. So we will continue to invest heavily in R&D. If we look back year-over-year as I said operating expenses, and we have had a lot of cost savings in COGS too, but OpEx cost reductions have been about $107 million when you take out the noise from restructuring, M&A and equity expense. So this is really a pure look at OpEx. Of that $107 million about $81 million are what we would call permanent savings and $26 million or so reflect the impact of the temporary savings which as the business recovers further will be restored. 
Mahesh Sangareria - RBC Capital Markets:  I am a little bit confused about the statement you made about revenues by segment. Did you say that AGS and display would be higher than company average, SSG in line with company average and EES lower than company average in terms of the October quarterly revenue growth? 
George Davis :  I didn’t say it quite that specifically. I did say silicon would be in line with what we were targeting for revenue growth. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA. 
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: On tax rate how should we be thinking about that for the rest of this year and moving forward? I’m sorry to ask the question again, I didn’t quite capture it on the OpEx, how much of the temporary cost cuts are going to come back and over what time period do those start to come back?  Taking that the next step further once those temporary cost reductions are put back into the P&L what do you think the operating drop through, the incremental operating margin of the model should be? 
George Davis :  On the tax rate obviously we are running at a negative tax rate this year. We were at -26% for this quarter and expect for the full year to be around -34%. Obviously that isn’t our normalized tax rate. Low 30’s trending down over time we think to the mid 20’s.  On OpEx, we have said in our program this year we have a $460 million reduction. That is permanent cost reduction so that is about $115 million per quarter run rate of which roughly 2/3 is OpEx, 1/3 is cost of goods. In terms of when temporary comes back it certainly will come back as the business recovers. The pace of that, we will talk about what the new year looks like on our fourth quarter call and give you a little bit more of an insight into that, but that is as we said about $80 million a quarter and will come back as the company gets back to stronger earnings. 
Michael Sullivan:  Thanks Dan. With that I would like to ask Mike Splinter to share some concluding remarks with us. 
Michael Splinter :  Thanks Mike. In closing, we are encouraged by initial signs of economic recovery that point to an improvement in our business. We see positive near-term demand trends in consumer electronics and a sharply improved outlook for flat panel displays. We also see building strength in solar. Still we remain cautious and balanced in our optimism. The equipment sector needs a sustained recovery that keeps customer factories and high utilization and encourages new capital investments.  In the meantime we are preserving our financial strength and improving our operating efficiency while broadening the opportunities for our nano manufacturing technology. I would just once again like to say thank you everybody for joining the call today. Thank you very much. 
Michael Sullivan:  Thanks Mike. We would like to thank everyone for joining us. A replay of this call and a supporting slide package will be available on our website today beginning at 5:00 p.m. PT and it will be there until August 25th. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials. 
Operator:  This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Michael Sullivan:  Thank you [Kara] and good afternoon and welcome to our call everyone. Joining me today are Mike Splinter, our Chairman and CEO, George Davis our Chief Financial Officer, and Joe Sweeney our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.  Today we will discuss the results for our second quarter of fiscal 2009 which ended on April 26.

Mike Splinter will lead off the call with comments on the market environment and our company’s strategies. George will follow with a discussion of our financial performance for the second quarter and our expectations for the third quarter. After these remarks from Mike and George, we’ll open the call for questions.  And with that I’d like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter.
Michael R. Splinter:  Thanks Mike and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. As we anticipated in February, weak demand drove revenue to the lowest levels we’ve seen since 2002. We focused on the goals we outlined for you last quarter and were able to preserve our balance sheet, make significant investments in our future and deliver clear progress on the cost reduction goals we committed to last November.  The global macroeconomic environment is weak although the U.S. economy is showing signs that its rate of decline may be slowing. The market in China is responding to stimulus, driving demand for mobile handsets and infrastructure as well as personal computers and TVs. As a result, factory utilization is rising in semiconductor and display and customer confidence is growing. DRAM prices have increased about 30% since the beginning of the year, largely driven by a 15 to 20% bit output reduction. Still, the economy remains a challenge and a meaningful improvement in the equipment sector depends on a sustainable recovery in our customers end markets. They can keep factories full and encourage new capital investments. In the meantime, we’re making substantial investments in our technology and expanding our core markets, growing our position in solar energy and deepening our customer relationships.  We’re also driving new business processes and operating efficiencies to serve us well now and in the eventual recovery. Our employees are engaged in delivering these objectives across the company, and I appreciate their efforts and results they are producing. Now I’d like to give you some insight in each of our business segments. In Silicon end market demand appears to be rising off the bottom but it’s still at very low levels. In Logic our customers report shrinking inventory levels and stronger order flows. Foundry utilization is moving higher from levels below 50% in calendar Q1 to a projected level of nearly 70% by the end of Q2. And many prices have strengthened since the beginning of the year, though they are still too low to generate profits for most customers. We now expect wafer fab equipment spending to be between $8 and $11 billion in calendar ’09. And reaching the upper end of that range would require sustained pick up in the second half.  Our leading edge customers are driving the order book as the focus is on technology buys designed to move capacity to the next node. In Taiwan we anticipate investments by companies who are adopting stack DRAM technology giving us gains in FE, DPN, etch and PVD. Many customers are working hard to get positioned to invest in the next generation but their timetable is still unclear. And the few capacity purchases we’re seeing are happening on a short lead time basis. The semiconductor outlook today is for improved business in our third fiscal quarter, bearing in mind that visibility into Q4 is still limited. Technology transitions in semiconductors are creating opportunities for Applied’s technology solutions. As logic moves to 32 nanometers, we’re expanding the market for our selective FE and metal gate systems for advanced transistors. As DRAM and nan transitions to copper interconnects, we’re growing in PVD liner barrier applications. And as customers adopt immersion lithography, we’re gaining share in mass [conspection], brine field inspection and advance patterning films. In ATS while our spares business has been tracking with low factory utilization, our services business has been more resilient. With recovery in customer utilization rates we are now seeing our spares business improve and are fielding a higher number of requests for 200 millimeter technology upgrades. We’re pleased to have Applied service agreements in place at all of the SunFab Solar Lines now in production. In display, while the global TV market is expected to be flat this year, LCD TV demand is forecast to grow by over 10% to comprise 55% of the 2009 market. Low TV prices are driving demand and utilization rates higher, but our customers are still working to regain profitability. We maintain our view that display capital spending will be down by more than 50% in 2009 with our revenue expected to bottom in Q3. We do anticipate an order recovery in Gen 8.5 before the end of the year, with the broader recovery arriving in 2010. We already have a number of Gen 10 systems in start up mode as well. Turning to solar, the capping of subsidies in Spain was the inflection point in the market. This coupled with the economic and credit situation is clearly weighing on the industry’s momentum. Polysilicon contract pricing was lower this period, averaging $60 to $70 per kilogram while module prices dropped but to a lesser degree. Overall, PV equipment spending is likely to be greater than $3 billion in 2009 and down 50%, while module installations are expected to fall by less than 20% this year. In crystalline silicon, our business held up well in this environment. To increase panel efficiency a number of our customers are adding process steps that are resulting in new opportunities for a [Becini] cell systems. We also see demand for equipment that can lower production costs and we launched the MaxEdge Wire Saw which enables material cost savings of up to $0.18 per watt beyond those gained from lower polysilicon prices. In thin film solar, we passed a number of important SunFab milestones. Green Energy Technologies was our fourth customer to sign off onto SunFab and the first in Taiwan. Their factory ramp was also our fastest to date. Sunfilm of Germany became our fifth customer to achieve signoff and the first SunFab utilizing our tandem junction technology which boosts conversion efficiency by about 30% over single junction. Looking back over the past six months, we signed off five factories in four countries bringing a new level of scale to solar. Total SunFab capacity has reached 200 megawatts and our customers have produced more than a quarter million panels. We have demonstrated module efficiency beyond 9% in the lab and we’re on track to have 10% efficiency in production in 2010 with production costs under $1 per watt. We’re making substantial R&D investments to drive our progress in thin film, well beyond these targets and to broaden our crystalline silicon portfolio as well. Looking ahead we have a number of active SunFab opportunities that we plan to turn into contracts in upcoming months. In the U.S. policy arena we’re working on a variety of measures including a progressive national renewable electricity standard with a dedicated carve out for distributed generation that benefits solar. We see this policy as key to growing a renewable energy market. To summarized, Applied has focused our long-term success on opportunities, investing in our semiconductor display and PV segments to strengthen our number one position in each. We’re managing well in a tough environment, preserving our financial strength and generating new operating efficiencies. And while we’re encouraged by some positive signs in demand and factory utilization, the economic outlook remains weak and visibility is limited. Now I’ll pass the call over to George Davis who will discuss our financial results and expectations. George?
George S. Davis:  Thank you Mike, and good afternoon to everyone. On our last call we said Q2 would be a tough quarter and that we would be intently focused on managing our cash and our cost structure. It was a tough quarter as revenue fell 24% to just over $1 billion and orders declined to $649 million, reflecting a level of demand the company has not experienced for more than a decade. It was also a period of excellent cash flow performance, with cash from operations well below our cash flow breakeven model. We have taken the challenge to preserve our cash position and balance sheet strength while maintaining a high level of investment in products and technology. Consistent with that challenge we remain on track to exceed our cost reduction targets across the company. For the quarter, our GAAP loss was $255 million or $0.19 per share. Our non-GAAP loss was $136 million or $0.10 per share.  In our GAAP results the company took pretax charges totaling $166 million in response to the weak industry environment. These charges impacted our earnings by $0.09 per share and included equity investment impairments of $77 million related to our holdings in Sokudo and other strategic investments, inventory writedowns of $47 million across our business in response to lower demand, restructuring and asset impairment charges of $27 million associated with our cost reduction plan, and bad debt provisions of $15 million due to the further impact of customer solvency issues. The company’s reported gross margin for the quarter was 15% which was down 14 points versus Q1 due to lower revenue, mix effects, factory under absorption and inventory writedowns. Revenue and mix effects accounted for 11 points of the reduction as low margin SunFab revenue increased while higher margin SSG revenue decreased.  Operating expenses versus Q1 were down 24% on a GAAP basis and down 9% or $36 million on an ongoing basis. Ongoing operating expense is down 18% or $86 million relative to Q4 ’08. These reductions reflect the impact of our $400 million cost reduction program as well as ongoing short-term cost reductions through shutdowns, pay cuts and reductions in variable pay. These short-term initiatives are additive to our cost reduction program. We will exceed our $400 million target by at least $60 million or 15% based on actions identified to date and expect that amount to be fully reflected in our Q4 run rate. Approximately two-thirds of the cost reductions will be in operating expenses. We continue to explore ways to improve our operating excellence. As of the end of Q2 we have reduced our headcount by 1,600 regular full time employees and over 300 temporary employees versus Q4 ’08. Current actions will result in total reductions of approximately 2,300 employees by fiscal year end.  The company generated $84 million from cash in operations or 8% of revenue. Free cash flow was 3% of revenue with our capital spending remaining at low levels. Our cash and investments balance of $3.1 billion is essentially unchanged from Q1. Our operating cash flow breakeven objective is targeted at $1 billion and quarterly revenue once our cost reduction program is fully implemented. In Q2 we operated ahead of this objective thanks to extraordinary efforts on working capital management by our employees. Our backlog ended the quarter at $3.2 billion. Backlog adjustments totaled $527 million and included $202 million in cancellations and financial de-bookings of $307 million. The cancellations were mostly attributable to SSG customers. De-bookings reflect orders that have not been canceled but are expected to be realized outside of our 12 month bookings window. Over half of the de-bookings were in our services segment due to lower fab utilization rates, with the balance coming from silicon and display. At quarter end the EES segment represented 37% of our backlog. Silicon was 23%, services was 22% and display was 18%. Within EES thin film makes up slightly more than half of the backlog with crystalline silicon accounting for slightly less than half and the balance from glass and [waf]. Now I will review our segment results. Silicon systems orders of $259 million were slightly above Q1 levels, increasing 5% but coming off at low base. SSG order composition was foundries 34%, logic and other 32% and DRAM and flash at 17% each. SSG revenue of $260 million was down over 50% from Q1, roughly in line with our expectations. Approximately 60% of that revenue came from three customers who are advancing their plants to move to new technology notes.  SSG reported an operating loss of $96 million or 37% of sales. Adjusting for the impact of inventory charges SSG’s gross margin would have been just under 38% reflecting our strong variable cost model from manufacturing operations. In AGS orders declined 24% from Q1, in line with low [fabulization] levels and customer cost and control initiatives. Q2 revenue was down 7% versus last quarter and operating profit was just below breakeven. Revenues continued to be impacted by low demand for refurbished equipment and systems upgrades that add to capacity. The spheres run rate showed improvement in the second half of Q2 and we expect to see revenue trend upward for AGS in Q3. Display orders fell to $13 million in Q2, a clear bottom as utilization rates are now improving and customers are increasing their focus on the second round of Gen 8.5 orders. Revenue declined to $84 million, a 44% reduction from Q1. Our display group has managed its variable operating model extremely well and as a result operating profits were just above breakeven for the quarter. In EES, orders were $141 million, a decrease of 56% from Q1 due to lower SunFab and crystalline silicon solar orders. EES revenue was up 22% from Q1. Revenue was higher than expected due to an additional signoff of one of our SunFab lines and receipt of our first performance bonus from one of the factories in production. EES operating profit declined to negative 26% of revenue reflecting the impact of negative SunFab margins, inventory writedowns and mergers and acquisition charges carried in that segment. SunFab profitability will improve on subsequent lines as we shorten start up cycle times and performance bonuses are earned on certain of the SunFab factories that have already passed final acceptance tests. Now moving onto our outlook for Q3. The macroeconomic environment impacting our customers remains difficult and uncertain. We see low levels of revenue with spending concentrated in a few customers. In this environment a change in just one customer’s plans can lead to large impacts on our performance against forecasts. As a result, our guidance for fiscal Q3 will reflect a broad range.  First, I will highlight our expectations for the segments before providing our company targets. For SSG we expect revenue to be flat to up 40% with one or two customers driving the variability. For services we expect that a gradual pick up in spares run rates will increase revenue by more than 5%. For display, fiscal Q3 revenue should drop by approximately 50% from Q2, marking the bottom for fiscal 2009. For EES, reductions in the number of SunFab signoffs and a continued slowing in crystalline silicon equipment should cause revenue to decline by at least 30%. Combining these segment expectations, we expect overall revenue for the company in Q3 to be in the range of flat to down 15%. We expect a loss per share in the range of $0.06 to $0.14 depending on revenue and mix. While we are not making a specific forecast for orders, we currently expect Q3 to be higher primarily due to increases in orders in SSG and AGS. Now Mike, let’s open the call for questions.
Michael R. Splinter:
 : Thanks George. And to help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow up. Kara, let’s please begin with the first question.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brett Hodess - BAS-ML.
Brett Hodess - BAS-ML:  I’m wondering if you can go into a little bit more detail on the very broad range in the silicon area. Obviously it’s only one or two customers, but are those customers’ plans still really in high flux at this point? And what would cause them to, you know, be on the positive side or the negative side of that from your standpoint at this stage?
Michael R. Splinter:   Well, Brett, I think this is a very dynamic environment so as George characterized one or two customers can make all the difference in the world. And shift in the end market over the next couple of months could cause customers not to take shipments or to cancel orders, those kind of things can happen very dynamically in this environment. You can remember back just a couple of quarters when orders started to go down with the realization of the global economic crisis, they can go up that fast as well, but I just think it’s very dynamic right now.
George S. Davis:   Brett I also think that we’re seeing an increase in the amount of turns business in the quarter and so the uncertainty that is associated with that is higher than we might see in more normal times. And the other piece is we’re just starting from just such a low base that when you see a wide range like that, part of it is just where we’re starting from.
Operator: Your next question comes from James Covello - Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs:  I guess the question I would have is relative to the memory segment in the back half of this year, what do you think the benchmarks are going to be for your customers to start to add some additional capacity? Is it a certain profitability level? Is it a certain price? What do you think about that? And kind of tying in with that which I think is the same question, what about the issue of latent capacity in the memory segment that everyone’s worried about kind of trumping the kind of robust price increases that we’re seeing?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, Jim, I think the real thing that’s going to push capacity in the second half of the year is adoption of DDR3. At least that’s going to be one of the major factors. Those projects have to be on leading edge or near leading edge capacity. And most of what we might think of as latent capacity, there’s been a lot of capacity taken offline that’s not coming back on 200 millimeter, but to the degree that there is latent capacity most of it’s on older generation technologies and I don’t think can produce at the right cost or really the right level of technology. So, but I think the fundamental for memory guys is demand really going to pick up? Is there going to be strength in PCs and cell phone demand? I think that’s really what’s going to drive them.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Chin – UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Just a question on the solar business, I didn’t hear you talk much about any upgrades for tandem solar equipment now that you have your first signoff. And you didn’t call that solar as potentially seeing order growth, so what is your outlook for orders for upgrades to the tandem equipment now that you have your first signoff?
Michael R. Splinter:   What I would say about that is every single junction customer would be considering a tandem junction upgrade and I think that just depends on the individual timing for each of them and how their factory is running, the degree of success that they’re having in the marketplace. But clearly eventually all those factories have to move to tandem junction. And we’re not making the specific forecast by factories, so I don’t know what you want to add to that, George.
George S. Davis:   No, I think that’s right. And we are expecting to continue to see customer’s signoff factories for the remainder of the year. We’re very pleased with the overall momentum that we’re seeing there. And the year is 2009 for us is really playing out pretty much as we saw it when we started looking at the end of last year. So we’re very pleased with the overall performance. Obviously as we said, 2009 was going to be our year to absorb the learning curve and we’re certainly going through that but we’re pleased with what we’re seeing otherwise.
Michael R. Splinter:   Great Steve. Do you have any follow up or are you good? Thanks. Kara, can we take the next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse:  What was the magnitude of the inventory writedowns and do you have any charges from the EES group? And the follow up in that, given the learning’s that you’ve had with lowering the product times in SunFab, what is now the clean breakeven target for the EES division?
Michael R. Splinter: The EES inventory impact was about 60% of the overall inventory writedown and it related to the, some excess inventory with OEM suppliers. In terms of the bad debt that was not, there was no bad debt impact on EES in the quarter. In terms of breakeven we haven’t guided to a new breakeven level. You know obviously we expect thin film to improve substantially from these levels. We’ll start to see that quite frankly in the latter half of this year and crystalline silicon is already effectively operating breakeven or higher depending on the individual quarter once you pull out the M&A charges.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri – Citi.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi:  First of all, what sort of, you know, pipeline do you have left in terms of thin film orders? By my numbers it seems like you’ve recognized roughly $750 million worth of SunFab orders so it seems like maybe you have kind of $1 to $200 million more left in that pipeline. So that’s the first question. And then the second question is if the financing environment doesn’t get better, you know for your customers in the solar business, what sort of contingency plans do you have to basically keep that business growing if your customers can’t get money?
George S. Davis:   Maybe I can jump in first and come at it, Tim, from maybe a slightly different angle than you did. But to date we have shipped nine full factories and we have five that are signed off. We have five lines that are in the process of being shipped or will be shipped. And so if you look across the, and to date we’ve had one signoff in fiscal year ’08, we’ve had four more signoffs in ’09. My expectation is we’ll probably have at least three signoffs or I think three is a good estimate, additional signoffs before the end of this fiscal year. So when you think about from a revenue perspective and we have about 25% of the expected revenue from these fully secured projects has been revenue through Q2. So we’ve got a substantial amount of additional activity, not only in terms of factories to signoff but bonus performance opportunities on our existing factories. So there’s no question that obviously we would like to see the pipeline grow from where it is today, but I think the reasons for that pulling back and the financing market situation are well understood.
Michael R. Splinter: Are you done?
George S. Davis:   Yes.
Michael R. Splinter: I’d just add two things, Tim. For us I think the two big things we need to do is continue to drive the performance of SunFab up and continue on the pretty dramatic learning curve we’ve been experiencing over the last six months. And then the other thing is to work downstream to help increase the market size and the market opportunity. And whether that’s working with utilities or the government to set the right policies, those things are absolutely critical to expand the market.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi:  I guess, Mike, I’m just wondering whether you would throw money at your customers and you would kind of, you know, self finance any deals.
Michael R. Splinter: No. We’ve said all along that we view that customers should be able to secure their own financing if they have the right end market strategy, and we don’t believe that we add anything by playing the role of a bank.
Operator: Your next question comes from Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley:  George, assuming that you hit your high end of the revenue guidance flat and given what you said about, you know, Q3 orders from SSG and AGS could be higher, is it fair to assume that your revenues will be higher in Q3 given your backlog mix?
George S. Davis:   No. Malik as we said we think revenues will be flat to down for the quarter. Let me make sure I understand. Are there specific revenues you’re interested? Obviously SSG we believe will be up and AGS we believe to be up but overall because of the fall off in display and the absence of as many SunFab signoffs we’ll be down in the other segments.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley:  What I meant to say was the quarter after July will your revenues maybe be higher given your order mix in the July quarter?
George S. Davis:   Oh, Q4. Well, we’re not going to guide to Q4 but it’s a positive trend for sure.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley:  It’s pretty clear that your solar technologies are viable given the customers and add. They appeared to signoff and they paid you the revenue. The question on economics, I mean when do you think the company will be able to come up with some kind of, you know, endorsement by system installers and named degraders who have, you know, bought this panel from your customers and kind of endorse your map on $1 per watt and balance the system costs? I mean, are we looking into the next two to six months or is it longer?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, hopefully it’s not any longer than that, Atif. You know these are still the early days of the panels getting out into the field so we have to, and today most of the panels are quarter size panels that are moving out into the field. So this is going to take a little bit of time to really get the volume out there, the reliability data and the trust going. But we’re working hard in that area.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities:  There were some pretty significant cancellations, de-bookings this quarter. How well scrubbed is backlog and how much risk is there to backlog looking forward by business?
George S. Davis:
 : Well I think you’ve seen over the last two quarters a lot of backlog adjustments. We had fairly significant in crystalline silicon in the first quarter and we’ve seen in the cancellation side really the effects of certain semiconductor customers just changing their plans based on a change in their strategy. So that led to a cancellation. The de-bookings really for the first time we’ve seen bookings in our services area of any material size, and that makes up about half of it. And it really reflects what we’ve seen over the last two quarters in terms of a big drop and run rate of the factories, our customers’ factories. We expect quite frankly that there’ll be some recovery there over the next two quarters but even as you can see with the order outlook, people are still cautious on the services side and I think that’s just potential upside over the next two quarters.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities:  In your prepared remarks, you gave a range for wafer fab equipment and said the high end of that range would require a sustained pick up in the second half of the year. Do you have a building sense of confidence that that can happen?
Michael R. Splinter: Well I think as George said there are some positive trends, but boy, Steve, it’s pretty tough to be over confident in this environment where economies are still very, very weak. We’ve certainly seen some pick up in China. Will that be sustained over the summer? I think it’s very hard to tell at this point. So, you know, are we happy that utilization is up and customers are getting some confidence? Yes. But all the buys so far are technology buys. I think we would have to see a little bit of capacity buy before the end of the year to get to a number like $11 billion.
Operator: Your next question comes from C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital.
C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital:  One question to clarify, what were the M&A charges for EES? And when do those run off? And then my primary question is in terms of your EPS guide, what kind of range should we assume for gross margin, tax rate and losses if any for the JV? Any help on those three fronts would be very helpful particularly given the higher tax rate and the benefit there in the last quarter.
George S. Davis:   C. J., that was a very good question of asking four questions but I think I can go pretty quickly here. First off on the EES M&A charges, they’re running about $20 million a quarter, again about $15 of that in cost of sales. That will continue to decrease over the next couple of years as it is lower this year than last year. I n terms of our EPS guidance again as we’ve said we’re going to have a better mix outlook, so that will be favorable to gross margin. So you could see, you know, we had, depending on where revenue comes out with the mix we said it could cost us 11 points last quarter. So something between where we were today, I think 11 points is probably possible just on revenue and mix. In terms of the tax rate, I would just hold it constant at this point. There’s, you know, in this environment predictability is a little bit challenging.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Blansett - J.P. Morgan.
Christopher Blansett - J.P. Morgan:  It’s really to the solar side of the business and you have a large number of crystalline silicon customers. I wasn’t sure if you could give us an update on their utilization rates and what you think their ability to raise capital is at this time?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, I’m not sure I can give you a very detailed update. The big, I think what we see so far is, you know, a lot of the little companies around the world and China in particular have begun failing just because they can’t sell their product. But the bigger companies are still able to finance and still able to add capacity. We gave you an estimate that revenue, or that spending, capital spending would be down about 50% year-over-year. But the big players can still get money and still finance their capacity.
Christopher Blansett - J.P. Morgan:  I guess the second question, you kind of related to the technology buys in the semiconductor industry. You indicated in the upfront statements that some of your solar customers are buying equipment in kind of the same bent as a technology purchase. Could you give a little more detail on that and what it is giving them at this time?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, you can relate yield in semiconductors with efficiency. And in solar there’s very, very high motivation always to improve the yield in semiconductors. There’s equally as high a motivation to improve efficiency in solar. Of course, all of those things have to net out to be cost reductions in the end product, but there is lots of interest in different kinds of capability, lowering the resistance of metal lines, improving contact capability on solar. These kind of things that do help with the overall efficiency of the cells are very much in demand because it can improve existing capacity as well as make new capacity more saleable.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.:  First question, in terms of the memory marketplace with, you know, the Taiwan sector kind of consolidating and finally, I guess, sorting itself out. How does that impact you guys as we look to the next upturn in terms of capacity buys?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, okay, so there’s kind of the two camps, so the different technologies and obviously the one that I alluded to in my prepared remarks of converting this back cell, I think we feel like we do very well in that segment and should gain in a number of different places including FE and DPM and PVD and etch as I outlined. In the other segment, there’s no real conversion so market shares are static. But as we get back to capacity buys it will be a net positive for us.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus & Company Inc.:  In terms of the solar ramp especially on the SunFab side of things, when do you believe, I guess, the infrastructure cost investment and I guess the learning curve costs, when will that I guess sort of end? And when revenues do pick up, it’ll flow to the bottom line. When do you see that type of model hitting for the SunFab business?
George S. Davis:
 : Yes, Patrick, we said that we thought that we needed to get through 2009 and my view really hasn’t changed on that. Certainly by the end of our fiscal year we’ll see stronger profitability on the lines being signed off. We certainly see very attractive profitability on the bonuses as they’re signed off. So we’re very close to that time period.
Operator: Your next question comes from Analyst for Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.
Analyst for Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.:  In terms of solar business could you provide a breakdown in terms of orders and revenues between crystalline and the thin film business?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. We haven’t been giving out the specifics in that regard. I can tell you that if you look at the order run rates, again we had the bulk of our orders for this year were in Q1 for thin film. We’ve had kind of constant, we’ve had kind of a what I would call a steady state order book for crystalline silicon really throughout the year. So you can see a lot of the volatility in the order rate for EES is really the order book for thin film.
Analyst for Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.:  With the recent silicon orders from foundries and [memory] could you give a quick comment on your progress in getting market share in the silicon space? 
Michael R. Splinter:   I think I just gave you a bit of that in the DRAM space, but also in the DRAM space we’re as most of the manufacturers move to copper we will gain in PVD. We’re also gaining in the contact etch and some damascene etches that multiple DRAM guys in Asia. And logic is really going to be focused around high k and better lithography, immersion lithography inspection, both mask inspection and in fab inspection. So we think we’re going to see progress in all those areas.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini - FBR Capital Markets.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR Capital Markets:  Mike, I wanted to go back to your earlier comment talking about production costs of your thin film modules coming down to list at $1. Can you please help me understand what kind of minimum capacity would that require? And would you be more flexible with your customers in terms of material or component and supplies?
Michael R. Splinter: Okay, so that quota 10% and $1 is meant to be essentially a one line number. We feel that if we have a multiple line factory we would actually do better than that. So that’s in tandem junction something approaching 80 megawatts, single line performance. So I think that pretty much takes care of that question. On flexibility, does this mean kind of an open standard, mix and match equipment on the line? Is that what you’re asking?
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR Capital Markets:  Yes. More flexibility in terms of helping your customers to reduce costs at a faster rate as crystalline or other thin film technology prices that [inaudible] needs to come down?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, I don’t know that those two are mutually exclusive. We are working really hard and really fast in putting every dollar of our R&D in thin film to help drive down the overall cost per module. So, but if anybody in the SunFab network has a good idea to help reduce costs, of course we’re open to that. We want to promote the learning to be as fast as possible, so all of the SunFab customers have engineers, have people that are working on cost reduction.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR Capital Markets:  But you have to be certified by a [inaudible] material, right? Those vendors?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, certainly before FAT they do. We have to insure that we can deliver what we promised of course.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok - Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company:  My first question is on the display side. Mike, you said that you expect a broader recovery in 2010. Do you anticipate customers not coming back with ordering in the calendar second half of this year or do you think it’s going to be more like middle 2010? How do you we look at that?
Michael R. Splinter: Well we think the order progress will start in the second half of 2010 because we just believe that LCD TVs continue to take share in the overall TV market. And as the economy improves and the TV market grows a bit, I think capacity will be strained. So as soon as that happens we’re going to see orders. And we think those capacity orders will be for Gen 8.5 initially. And then in 2010 we think we’ll see the progression move to Gen 10.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company:  Let me just clarify. That was second half of 2009 or 2010?
Michael R. Splinter: Second half of 2009. I’m sorry, I said ’10. Thinking ahead I guess.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company:  And then my follow on question is on crystalline silicon, solar increment business. Recently there was some talk about some of your competitors winning business in China. I was just wondering if you can kind of talk about your competitive position in your [bachene] line and your wafer line. How do you guys view that and do you see increased competition in those areas?
Michael R. Splinter: I’m not sure I caught the end of the question. On bachene and then you said something else?
George S. Davis:
 : And on the wafering side. 
Michael R. Splinter: And on the wafering side. I think we’re very pleased with where bachene is and performance of the products and kind of next generation roadmap that we have for those products, and the progress they’re making in China. In the wafering systems I think it’s a little bit more challenging. Our share isn’t as high there so the competition between us and our prime competitor is more on a case by case basis who has the most value. But I like where we’re going. As I said we just introduced our new product this quarter and it really drives cost down, so we think we’re going to make a lot of progress with this product.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sangareria - RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sangareria - RBC Capital Markets:  I just want to get some clarification on the orders, maybe some color on what you are looking into for the July quarter. First on the services, the orders are down 60% year-over-year. The way I’m looking at your revenues are still running at like 100 plus per month. What did that February was unusually low and your back up to 100 plus run rate in income supporters for the services?
Michael R. Splinter: I’m not sure I can tie out to the numbers you just used. I can tie out to the year-over-year numbers. I think the order rate that we saw in Q2 is reflective of caution, and quite frankly we think there’s upside to that going forward in the second half of the year as we see sustained increases in utilization rates from the very low levels that we’re coming off of. So I think it may be a better conversation to take a look at service orders after this coming quarter, and I think that they’ll be as the outlook on the end of the year is there, customers will have more confidence in their utilization rates and their spares requirements.
Mahesh Sangareria - RBC Capital Markets:  Just quickly on the, again on the order rates for silicon systems group your rate for fab equipment expectation of $8 to $11 billion. For the last two quarters you were running at $1 billion a year rate, and if you take out your market share at 20% so that’s a $5 billion run rate. So are you looking at a 200% of change in the orders in the second half or the next quarter to get to the $8 billion even?
Michael R. Splinter: Okay, so, you know, off of this low kind of base that we had in Q2 you can have almost any number for, one of the numbers, you know, you kind of look at crazy numbers at this point. Our orders from foundry were up like 700% this quarter. But when you’re talking from various such low bases it almost doesn’t make any sense. I think the fundamental here is that as we said to get to $11 billion you’ve got to have some sustained growth. And we’re really, that $11 billion is in the calendar year not in our fiscal year so you can add a couple of months on to the end of that. But you’ve got to see a sustained growth, quarter over quarter through the end of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Analyst for Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA.
Analyst for Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA:  Could you give us an update on your strategies for the solar business, especially what sort of a cost per watt requirements do you get from customers and how are you going to meet them? Then I’m going to have a follow up.
Michael R. Splinter: Well I assume you’re talking about the thin film solar business?
Analyst for Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA:  Yes.
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. So the idea is to both attack on all fronts, of course, but to improve productivity, wafers are glass sheets per hour, and to drive efficiency to 10% and beyond. And then to look at every material and component that makes up the cost per watt and continually try to reduce that over the next 12 months. But certainly we have to be in that kind of a range of product out for contracts to sign in the next year or so.
Analyst for Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA:  Are there any kind of commitments to customers if you don’t meet their requirements on SunFab solar lines? Are there any penalties if you don’t meet the specs?
George S. Davis:
 : I’ll take that question. The contracts have performance requirements that, all of the contracts have some minimum performance requirements and it’s, and in many cases it has a performance type matrix so that we share in the upside with the customer and we actually as I said earlier we got our first payment under such a performance bonus in Q2. So yes there are minimum requirements. We’re clearly getting the signoffs when we said we would, which means we’re meeting those minimum requirements. We’re confident that we’ll continue to be able to do that and actually we expect to exceed those minimum requirements and perform against the bonus potential on a number of these facilities.
Operator: Your next question comes from Raj Seth - Cowen and Company,
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company:  Question for you, Mike. Excuse me. On memory if I assume that there wasn’t a lot of slack capacity in memory and I know that’s probably not realistic short-term, I’m curious if there’s a level of bit growth that would require aggregate capacity to be added in the context of pending shrinks. I mean, I guess I’m coming from a perspective that shrinks buy you some unit growth and some bit growth. I’m curious if you can provide a little perspective on what that might be.
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. I think there’s two things at work here. One is the conversion to DDR3 and then there’s just the market growth. So I think the conversion at capacity to the next generation node will largely be taken up and moving to DDR3 and then in the bit growth has to, we think has to be greater than 30% or so and closer to 40 to 45% level to really drive new capacity.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company:  One other one for George, George can you talk a little bit about your R&D priorities? I’m sure you can’t get too specific, but perhaps within SSG where you’re focused and solar versus silicon. Can you talk a little bit about where your priorities are short-term?
George S. Davis: Yes, Raj, the priorities are really independent of each of the segment. We take a look at the opportunities in each area and then go after them from that perspective. So it really lines up with where we want to compete. We’ve said in the silicon systems group we want to grow share in addition to our strong positions that we already have, we want to grow share in etch and in inspection in metrology and so we’ve increased our R&D efforts in those areas over the last couple of years. And we’re continuing to invest aggressively there. Now Mike talked about in solar we’re continuing to move and crystalline silicon our next generation products for both bachene and PWS those are priorities for us. Thin film solar there’s nothing more important in our mind than driving the efficiency roadmap ahead and staying on track. We’re on track now. We’ve had very good results in the lab that suggest we’re certainly on track for 9% this year and on our way to 10% next year. In display our focus on R&D is really on not only next generation products for our existing positions in PVD and color filter but the competitive entry into PVD through our pivot tool, and that’s a strong area of focus for us. So that’s kind of a recap, and we’ve spent a lot of time over the last two years prioritizing and prioritizing again the projects that we look at inhouse which has allowed us to really fully fund the strategic opportunities that we see without having to compromise our business model.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company:  On the solar side how much are you spending as a percentage of the total R&D spend if you can?
George S. Davis: We haven’t broken it out that way, but it’s, you know, it’s probably 25% to a third. In that ballpark. 
Michael Sullivan:  Hey, Raj, thank you for your questions. And Kara I think we have time for two more questions and then we’ll give our concluding remarks please.
Operator: Yes sir. Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri – Citi.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi:  Just a quick one. You know if I look at the margin in, you know, in the solar business that you’ve actually shown the last four quarters you know it looks like basically you’re spending about $1.4 billion total expenses in that business over the last four quarters or so. And I’m wondering out of that number, how much of that is related to the thin film business? So if, you know, just to kind of help us decide here, you know, if you were to segment those two businesses how much of that total expense number relates to thin film versus crystalline?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, I can’t tie out to the numbers that you have there. I think your numbers are high Tim. I would say also that you have to take into account the fact that we had a, last year we had about $120 million in M&A charges that were in those numbers as well. Clearly we’re committing R&D dollars there and we’re going through the start up of these factories, but those costs are really being captured as we signoff the factories. So I think your numbers are high and we can, if you want to again call the RO team I’m sure they’ll be happy to walk you through some of those assumption in a little more detail.
Michael Sullivan: Thanks Tim. Kara to you.
Operator: Your last question comes from C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital.
C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital:  I had one more question. George on the display side you talked about seeing potential orders in the second half of the calendar year starting to come in. You know you’ve got basically phase two I guess Gen 8 and a sharp Gen 10 phase three potentially coming. Can you talk a little bit about what you think the magnitude is looking to the second half and the first half of 2010 and what orders could look like relative to the strong level of CapEx we saw in 2007?
George S. Davis: That’s a good question. I wish we had the visibility to give you a clear answer on that. And it might be a fair criticism to say calling the bottom when orders are at 13 is not too brave, but we certainly do see, you know, pick up. Clearly the conversations that we’re having with our customers at all levels suggest that they’re readying for capacity additions at Gen 8.5. But again they’ve just come off a very difficult period. They had a big pick up in factory utilizations in the second quarter. Demand quite frankly looks pretty good for panels but at very low prices. So I think they’re going to have to have confidence in the Christmas season at the end of the year before we see commitments that would be material orders in the second half of this year.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you C.J. And Kara with that we’d like to just thank everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. A replay of this call and the supporting slide package will be available on our website today beginning at 5:00 Pacific Time and we’ll keep it posted there until May the 27th. Thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Michael Sullivan:  Thank you, Kierra, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to be joining you in my first earnings call here at Applied Materials. I know, many of you already and I hope to meet to many of you for the first time at our Analyst Day next week. The event will be held in New York on Wednesday, 18th from 9:00 clock Eastern until 12:30 pm with a live webcast. If you have any questions about the event please dial phone number on today's earnings press release. Our released was issued shortly after 1:00 pm today on business wire. And is also available on our website at amat.com. Joining me on the call today are Mike Splinter, our President and CEO, George Davis, Chief Financial Officer and Joe Sweeney, our General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Today we will discuss our results for the period ending January 25th. Mike Splinter will lee off the call with comments on the market environment and our company's strategies. George will follow with a discussion of our financial performance for the first quarter and our expectations and financial strategies for the future. After these remarks from Mike and George we will open the call for your questions. With that I would like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter. 
Mike Splinter:  Thanks Mike and welcome aboard. In our November call we said the weakening global economy will have significant impact on all of Applied businesses and likely affect our customers for a year or more. With that in mind we moved rapidly to lower our annualized spending more than $400 million. We are now implementing further actions including multi-week shutdowns in Q2 and Q3. And my executive staff and I will be taking additional pay cut as well as foregoing bonuses for 2009. As George will explain shortly we are on track with our cost reductions goals. Over Applied's long history we have developed proven strategies for managing challenging business conditions with an eye toward future opportunities. Our experience, flexible cost structure and balance sheet discipline are the foundation for our plans. Here is what we are doing. First we are preserving our strong balance sheet with a focus on cash flow, so that we maintain the ability to shape our future and support our business priorities. Second we are investing in our technology, products, people and customer relationships to enhance our leadership and to position for future growth. Third, we are using this period to drive operating efficiencies that will lower our cost profile today and increase our leverage during the recovery. So how bad is it? Our leading semiconductor customers say that the fall off in chip demand and pricing is the most severe they have ever experienced. Losses are mounting almost universally, fab utilization is at historic lows for both memory and foundry customers ranging from 30% to 70% to those factories that are completely shut down. We estimate that output has been reduced by about 25% over the past six months including about a 10% permanent reduction in memory capacity. There is essentially no demand for incremental capacity. Investments in next generation technology are modest and restricted. The poor utilization has resulted in an usually severe drop-off with more than 35% in our AGS revenue. We expect WFE spending to drop roughly 50% in '09 to somewhere between $10 billion and $12 billion and retain the upper end of that range; will require a clear pick up in demand in the second half of the calendar year. This is the lowest level of investment in more than 15 years. We are planning for a prolonged period of weakness. Clearly the wafer fab equipment industry will be changed as a result. However these are still their early days in this crisis and it is premature to speculate how fundamental the structural changes will be and how our customers adapt. There is much we will still learn over the next year. Now let's turn to our segments. In Silicon Systems Group our priorities are to strengthen our business and inspection while enhancing our leadership in CVD, PVD and CMP. Also putting significant focus on inventory management and supply chain health. Even though customers have stopped adding capacity. They are still driving the technology treadmill. Creating opportunities for us to position next generation products. During the quarter we maintained our momentum and innovative technologies, with the introduction of new systems for actually in wafer level packaging in context. As well its new mask inspection product for boosting little productivity within the fab. In services business has been hit by low fab utilization and multi week shut downs of customers. Despite this situation we are seeing strength in service contracts as customers cut fixed costs. Over the long run this is a fundamental and positive development for our service team. In Display demands have softened, following last year's record revenue with utilizations now as low as 30% to 40% in some factories. While panel inventory appears to be decreasing and prices are stabilizing we do not see capital spending recovering this year. So our focus is on product development for gen-10 and 11 and positioning for the eventual return to capacity buys. In solar VLSI recognized our leadership last week listing Applied Materials as a number one among the worlds PV equipment companies. We are proud of this achievement coming just two years after our first product offering. In terms of the solar outlook, we expect the crystalline silicon equipment market to be down about 50% year-over-year. We do expect our next generation products from Baccini Cell Systems and Precision Wafering Systems will maintain our strong position for the next phase of solar growth. In Thin Film Solar, we achieve a sign-off on two more SunFabs and completed certification on both single and tandem junction panels. While SunFab revenue is trending higher, the global credit crunch is impacting our new contract flow. And we expect to see a gap in additional contracts for Sunfilm lines until the credit market stabilizes. Our focus is on conversion efficiency, factory startup time, and productivity improvements to enhance the competitiveness of our SunFab offering. Governments around the world are looking at solar and CleanTech, as key elements of their economic stimulus and job growth plans. The US is the world's largest electricity market and the recovery package now moving through Congress could accelerate demand for solar over the next 12 months and beyond. Overall, our current visibility is extremely limited and it is much too soon to say how long this downturn will last. We took early and decisive actions to focus on our key priorities and preserve our financial strength. We will continue on that path. I want to thank the Applied team around the world. Our people are sacrificing with shutdowns and salary cuts, but they are making sure that we are operating efficiently and helping our customers deal with this environment. As I look to the future, I know we have the talent, products and resolve to turn today's challenges and difficulties and the opportunities for growth in the future. With that I will turn the call over the George to provide the details of our operating and financial results. George?
George Davis:  Thank you, Mike and good afternoon to everyone. As a reminder we published our preliminary results on February 2, so today I will review our final results for the first quarter. As Mike said, the company faced an extremely difficult environment during the quarter. Orders were down 59% and revenue was at the bottom of the target range. I will cover our results and then discuss the actions we are taking to reduce spending and preserve our balance sheet. GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.10 and included $133 million in restructuring charges which lowered earnings by $0.06. We also took $48 million provision for doubtful accounts and an additional $20 million inventory charge which together reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes charges primarily related to acquisitions, equity compensation and restructuring we had a net loss of $3 million or essentially a breakeven on an EPS basis. Operating expenses of $588 million were up 22% and reflected the impact of the restructuring charge and bad debt charges offset by $40 million in cost saving actions and approximately $45 million in reductions related to lower expected variable compensation.  Operating expenses on an ongoing basis were down 11% quarter-over-quarter reflecting the cost reduction efforts throughout the company. Backlog decreased by 16% to $4.05 billion. Backlog adjustments totaled $369 million. Financial debookings resulting from order push outs beyond our 12 months recognition window totaled $278 million. Of these debookings $210 million related to China based wafering customers and approximately $50 million from our semiconductor customers.  We had $94 million in cancellations almost all from semiconductor customers. At quarter end our EES segment represented 34% of backlog. SSG was 25%, AGS was 23% and display was 17%. Revenue in the quarter declined 35% from the previous quarter as expected weakness in our semiconductor and display segments was compounded by falling revenue in our global services group, notably driven by weak demand for spares. Gross margin was down nearly 10 points to 29.4% and was impacted by the mix effects of lower sales in SSG and AGS. Cash flow from operations was negative at 14% of revenue and free cash flow was a negative 19% as working capital changes lagged the fall off revenue. In particular inventories grew as the balance sheet absorbed long lead time items for Display and Solar and were committed primarily to the change in demand signals. We are highly focused on inventory management and collections and we know that Q2 is likely to have many of the same challenges we saw in the past quarter. We suspended our share repurchases program early in Q1 to preserve cash resulting in only $23 million in repurchases for the quarter. We do not expect to make any share repurchases in the second quarter. Our commitment to the dividend remains strong and we paid $80 million in dividends in Q1.  Now to our segment results silicon systems orders decreased 79% from Q4 with reduction required in all sectors as customers have minimized their equipment spending other than for advanced technology deployments. Our order composition was logic and other 58%, DRAM 26%, flash memory 12% and foundries at 4%. SSG revenue was down 27% from Q4 reflecting lower DRAM and foundry business. Operating profit fell to about 6% due to lower revenue, a weaker product mix and expenses related to inventory and bad debt. Excluding the bad debt charge operating profit would have been above 9%. Gross margin in the segment was approximately 45% despite the low absolute level of revenue. In AGS orders dropped 38% from Q4 while revenue dropped 35% as customers reduce factory utilization to historically low levels. Spares demand dropped to the higher rate than the drop in equipment spending. This is clearly outside of the typical pattern and led to lower revenue than expected based on historical correlations. As a result operating profit fell to [17%] or if you exclude bad debt expense 11%. In Display orders dropped 59% from Q4 and revenue fell 55% as the LCD market downturn resulted in extremely low customer factory utilization. And marginal demand for new equipment. Operating profits dropped to 17% on low factory absorption and higher inventory reserves.  In EES orders decreased by 34% from Q4 while revenue dropped 33% primarily due to declines in our precision wafering business. As a reminder, PWS benefited in Q4 of last year from an additional month of revenue as we aligned reporting periods. In thin film, Applied recognized revenue on our second and third SunFab production lines during the quarter. EES operating profit declined in line with the fall off in crystalline silicon revenue and the weak margins of our initial SunFab factories. In our corporate segment, the quarter-over-quarter reduction in operating expenses reflected both the adjustments for bonus accruals not utilized in 2008 and the ongoing cost reductions in our G&A functions. Let me spend a few moments on our outlook. The year ahead presents significant challenges and we are intently focused on managing our cash and cost structure. Our cost reduction efforts are well underway and we expect to exceed the $400 million in annualized cost savings from the plan announced in Q1. Total headcount reductions expected under the plan are now above 2000 positions or approximately 14% of our headcount at the end of our 2008 fiscal year. Continuing deterioration in our end markets is expected to lead to additional restructuring activities which are now under evaluation. By the end of fiscal 2009, we expect to reduce our quarterly revenue breakeven level to below $1.2 billion and our free cash flow breakeven revenue level to approximately $1 billion. Both of these measures are of course sensitive to product mix. We are also continuing to take multi-week shutdowns in many of our businesses in low Q2 and Q3 as we have done in the past two quarters. These actions typically save $35 million to $40 million per quarter in labor related cost. We believe these shutdowns allow us to keep critical resources in place while reducing cost in difficult times. We recognize that these actions directly impact our employees and we are appreciative of their continuing dedication and hard work. Because of the economic uncertainty and lack of visibility, we are now providing specific targets for order, revenue or earnings. We expect revenue decreases across all segments, and we believe overall revenue will be down by more than 30% quarter-over-quarter. We expect display and SSG to be the most impacted segments. We expect at least one additional SunFab sign off in Q2. And any revenue upside in our EES segment would come from acceleration of other SunFab factory acceptances as we are seeing improvement in our startup cycle time. Now Mike, let's open the call for questions.
Mike Splinter:  Thank you, George. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up. Kierra; let's begin with the first question please.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question will come from the line of Jay Deahna with JP Morgan
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan:  Thanks very much. A couple of questions, good afternoon. Given the pick up recently in memory prices, are you seeing any signs of life there or any indications that may be one or two to big memory guys might want to get their process going may in 3Q a little bit early, so that would be the first half topic. Then the second topic on solar and more for silicon in particular, how are you doing on the tandem junction, and are you thinking about accelerating your revenue recognition policy to 2% of completion or shipment at some point by the end of this year for SunFab?
George Davis:  Okay, I think there were three questions, Jay so let's if we can get all three of them done. Memory prices, yeah in the last couple of weeks we've seen a bit of a pick up I think, 10% or 12% last week and maybe 7% in the last week or so. I think this is more due to cutback of our supplies, shutdown of factories than to real demand pickup at this point, but I think it's still too early to say. I wouldn't say that we are seeing anybody getting anxious to add capacity. I mean people are still working on next generation of technology though. How are we doing on the tandem junction? In the lab, we are now seeing efficiency is 9% and as we continue to work on that that will continue to grow up, and our fab will have a signoff in Q2 I think for our first factory.
Mike Splinter: And then Jay on the revenue recognition, I would say we need to really get through these first SunFab startups and then that will probably be the direction we will go as percentage of completion, so my guess is it would four factory signoffs after 2009 will be my best guess at this point.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan:  Great.
Michael Sullivan:  Thanks Jay. Kierra, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup. 
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup:  Hi, a couple of things. First of all, George can you talk about breakeven in the silicon business and in solar and kind of how that’s going to layout in the next few quarters, and I guess as a follow-up, there is a lack of capital out there for your solar customers, has that made you at all reconsider your business model relative to being a little bit more vertically integrated on the thin film side?
George Davis:  Okay, I will take the first two and then may be Mike jump in on the second. So on solar and SSG breakeven, I think you saw, we continue to have very strong gross margins as I mentioned in SSG even at these revenue levels. And I think by any historic standards that team has done a great job in getting their variable cost where it needs to be and certainly it's helping us through this. That being said, we are going to continue to invest strongly in that business. It's important for positioning coming out. So we are in a breakeven at the expensive R&D is really not part of our operating model. But again, we start from a very strong position in SSG. In EES, what we are really dealing with here know is the crystal and silicon margins before you take a look at the impact of acquisition charges are actually quite, and is at a level that we were hoping to achieve coming and as part of the acquisition. It's really these initial on SunFab signoffs where we are really absorbing all the margin in the learning curve on these first few deals. I think what you will see is two things one the SunFab profitability will increase over the year as we move through the startup process. And then you will see that combined with the crystal and silicone. I think you will see some improvement in profitability there. Not ready to call the breakeven yet, because its makes such a huge factor for that business.
Mike Splinter:  Hey, Tim despite the credit crunch we are still talking to a number of customers in our pipeline that are planning, either new customers or repeat customers that are planning projects, so at least at the current time, we are not changing the business model there.
Michael Sullivan:  Okay. Thank you, Tim, and our next question please, Kierra.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus:  Thanks a lot. First question, in terms of the cancellation, you took a lot this quarter, do you plan another round of it in the April quarter and then leveling it off there? And the second question is, in terms of the memory consolidation, potentially is going to happen a lot of the Asian DRAM chipmakers, how do you feel you are positioned with the potential winners from that or the consolidators of that industry?
George Davis:  So, on the adjustments that we took to backlog reflect really our best understanding of the market conditions and our customers' situation today. So, we are not staggering them as we go, so we have to see what we learn during this quarter. And if there's further cancellations, or if we get push outs beyond our window, then we will go ahead and de-book. But we had anticipated as you may recall at the end of last quarter that while we hadn't seen any cancellations given that what was going on in the crystal and silicon markets around the world, that we expected to see some activity and certainly as you saw from the large component of wafering customers that the pushed out that we saw a fairly significant already in our first quarter. Whether that will continue or not, we will have to see, but this is our best view at this time.
Mike Splinter:  Patrick, the consolidation that's likely to take place in Taiwan, it's still uncertain who the consolidator is going to be. So it's a little tough to speculate that, one might be a Japanese company, one might be a US company. And I think we are well-positioned assuming that their technology would be proliferated throughout Taiwan, we are in very good shape with both of those companies.
Michael Sullivan:  Okay. Thank you for your questions. Kierra, next question please?
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS:  Hi, George. The question on the solar business, I know Mike you said the crystalline equipment sales could be down 50% this year. But given the new SunFab signoff this quarter, and maybe another signoff next quarter. Are you still budgeting for the solar division to grow sales, year-over-year and fiscal 2009. And my second question is that we are talking to press yesterday probably would temporarily close the Australian manufacturing plant for four weeks in June. Can you clarify what your plant in Australia, and should we model a negative growth margin stepped down in the July quarter to manufacturing growth. Thanks.
Mike Splinter:  So, yes, we should assume that SunFab will scale and revenue should increase throughout this year. What is going to happen here though, is we are going to have a gap over few quarters after essentially after our current projects go through may be some of the follow-ons go through. Because of the credit crunch right now, we are not seeing new contracts being signed. So we will see that sometime later, may be it will be into 2010.
George Davis:  And then on the margins for SSG, I think it's too early guide you to specifics, but clearly we said that we think the overall revenue will be down 30% in display and SSG was down most significantly. So that will lead to factory absorption. We have a variable model but it's not quite that variable.
Michael Sullivan: Steven, thanks for your questions Kierra.
Operator.: Your next question comes from the line Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse:  Alright thanks George I was wondering if you could clarify this how many SunFab lines are out there to which you have shipped the equipment and you have not recognized revenue on if you could help quantify the dollar value of the potential unrecognized revenues will be great. And secondly on the balance sheet you do not have the highest inventories both in dollars and in days and the receivable days have also increased. During the last downturn AMAT was very good with generating cash. This cycle it appears fundamentally different just given the high credit risk for your customers both in memory and solar. How should we think about cash generation this cycle particularly with the versatile balance sheet items?
George Davis:  Yeah first of all let me deal with the sign-off question. We signed off three and we said that effectively eight factory so there is five more. We are not guiding to the revenue but many of them have both sign off revenue at sign off and then a bonus potential. And we will talk more about those as each are realized. On the inventory side actually we have continued to have very strong cash flow discipline and I think if you look at the free cash flow that we had in 2008 even with a very different mix we are right on top of the kind of free cash flow that we are generating in 2004 for instance. So I would say this quarter obviously we are experiencing the inventory effects of having businesses that were in expansion mode as we were experiencing a very severe downturn within SSG and also a fall off in some of the services related revenue as well. So I would not say its really a change of the mix of our backlog as you know is very different than historically we are at as I said 34% of our backlog today is EES. And if you think about that over half of that is SunFab lines which are fully secured by LCDs and cash. Display which is really coming off of a big ramp up. And then the ramp down is at 17%. You got AGS at 23% of our backlog and SSG 25% so when you look at the mix of our business today. The inventory really reflects and the inventory management reflects the impacts of the different end markets there. We certainly expect to drive down inventory overtime. And we had working capital impacts this quarter. But we think they are reflective of the underlying business.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse:  Thank you.
Michael Sullivan: Kierra we will take the next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Great good afternoon guys. Thanks so much. Mike if I heard you right I think you said you believe that there has been about 10% of memory capacity has been permanently taken offline that's one of the big points of debate I think right now about some of those capacities come offline. How much of it is permanently gone versus. How much could come back on pretty quickly if pricing would continue to increase. How do you measure what's coming offline permanently versus what can sort of come back. And then as part of that my follow up would be the, fact that the spares business is down so much more than it would be in previous cycles, as part of that because customers are taking their, the stuff that's been shuttered in kind of tearing that apart using the spare parts to replace, what's left in the fab running and is that part of the reason that some of this capacity is gone. Thank you.
Mike Splinter:  Yeah, Jim. The way we are looking at this last year, we believe that 200 millimeter was some place between 17% and 20% of overall memory capacity. We think that it will be under 10% this year. And we think that that's permanent and then we think a little bit 300 millimeter, I think I am referring to will come offline this year. That's what we are looking at as being permanent. On the spares, I just think customers are using every means possible not to spend money and some of that is taking spares off, idle equipment or shuttered equipment. But if those pieces of equipment are going to come back online or in service, in upcoming months or quarters, I think we will see a snap back on spares.
George Davis:  Yeah, I think, Jim, that on our view based on this pattern that spares utilization or spare had kind of sign change in spares sales will be a good leading indicator for capacity utilization coming back. Thanks Jim.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs:  Thank you.
Michael Sullivan:  Kierra, back to you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer & Company.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Company:  Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick question here on EES, orders versus the revenue run rate. It sounds like in terms of that credit crunch and in terms of the crystalline silicon business, everything is headed for a downturn there. The orders relative to the revenue intake is pretty much in line. Can you give us a near term sort of picture on what sort of stabilizing in relative terms the EES business relative to silicon and display? And a quick follow up for George. George, how much of that $400 million in annual operating expenses are you actually going to be taking out of the EES division as opposed to other divisions?
Mike Splinter:  Right. Gary I think the big stabilizing factor right now for EES business is still Europe has terrific feed in tariffs and while Spain may be maxed out, Italy, France are ramping up there as well see increased demand out of those countries. So I think that's the big stabilizing factor in the EES market. And then of course I think there will be some anticipation soon on what's going to happen in the US. George you want to comment on orders versus derivative.
George Davis: Sure, I think one of the other factors is that even with some of the finance or debookings that we saw in the wafering side there still are selective crystalline silicon customer around the world who have capacity build out plans that are preceding and they are moving ahead and ordering leading edge equipment. Both from our wafering and from our metallization business. We also see an increase demand for our ATON tools. As capacity in these crystalline silicon factories gets larger and the value proposition for that tool increases. In terms of the cost reductions and the impact on EES, clearly that's a growing part of our business. But if you look at relative to Q4, we are pulling back on some of the spending there obviously also with some of the customer developments have slowed. But also as with every business, we are looking at every R&D program, every aspect of spending and looking for ways, minimizing those cost and EES is doing that part as well. But there still will be a significant investment in that business for the year.
Michael Sullivan: Thank you Gary. Kierra.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Barclays Capital
C. J. Muse - Barclays Capital:  Yeah good afternoon thank you for taking my questions, I guess first question considering EES is mostly coming from backlog and you guided through the crystalline silicon side could you give us an idea of what you think EES can grow in calendar '09 relative to the $1 billion credence in '08. And then secondly on the M&A front could you talk about your outlook for consolidation for the overall space and then in terms of the Applied specifically whether your focus is on silicon versus solar and I guess as part of that discussion whether any divestitures are on the table as well? Thank you.
George Davis: Let me take the growth year-over-year in EES. We generated approximately $800 million of revenue in EES in '08 and remember that also included some revenue from the glass and web business which is in their as well. We do think it will grow year-over-year as you know we are quite reluctant to forecast any parts of our business out multiple periods and this is no exception. But as we look at backlog today and the activity today we do believe it will be up over the $800 million year-over-year and it will be the one group.
Mike Splinter: And M&A space where we want the people disciplined and patient in this area. We do think that in semiconductor equipment there does need to be some consolidation or at least fewer players than we have today in market where capital intensity over a long haul has been modestly going down. It’s going to be harder to support so many companies. Another hand getting a consolidation to happen has been quite difficult if you look over the history of this market. I think there needs to be a triggering event what that will be is hard to say.  And as far as our focus on silicon versus solar, we are committed to both of those phases and as long as our company would have strategic fits. And its good for our shareholders, we would be interested. No real divestitures, major divestitures planned at this time. 
Michael Sullivan:  C.J., thank you for the questions. Kierra?
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with FBR.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR:  WFB market probably around $10 billion to $12 billion.
George Davis:  Mehdi, I am sorry to interrupt but we didn’t catch the first part of your question. Would you mind starting that over?
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: Sure. Mike talked about WFB market size of about $10 billion to $12 billion in 2009 and to hit the high end of that target the business has to pickup significantly in the second half. First, what gives you the confidence that will happen, what I see in the horizon is anything like that. So, why not just be more conservative.  And number two, George you talked about breakeven point of less than $1.2 billion, does that include additional restructuring that is coming or is that included or not?
George Davis:  Sure, let me just answer for you now the breakeven number as you know we were on an ongoing basis effectively breakeven this quarter. So its not meant to include any extraordinary items, any extraordinary reserves. It's really the ongoing operations of the business. 
Mike Splinter:  Mehdi, as far as the WFB, this is kind of projection, how we are handling things internally, we are not restructuring to plan on an uptick in the second half. We have brought down the spending. We are bringing down the breakeven point as the cost savings go through, bit as low as George describes. So we are not really planning internally on any snap back or increase in spending, but in normal years, where there is a buying increase in the second half of the year, you would expect some increase in spending to support that. But, whether it will happen, whether the downside would be 50% as we are projecting or 60%, I don’t have much more visibility than that.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR:  Sure.  
Michael Sullivan:  Mehdi, thank you. Kierra, next question please.
Operator: Yes sir. Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch:  Good afternoon. Really two questions, on the SunFab, the GAAP that you might get next year because of the credit crisis, I was wondering how some of the longer term contracts like the 8-K you had out last year on the $1.9 billion contract. How does that play into the GAAP, are those things getting pushed out further or are those still on track some of those larger longer term projects?
Mike Splinter:  Well, it's hard to describe what's happening with one customer, but they are working, they have finished their building and they are looking at their own schedule and demands. So, we are staying very-very close to them and working to make sure that the factory comes up on time and it's sized to meet their off take agreement. 
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: And then just a quick follow on the inventory. It sounded to me George that you are saying that either inventories, or days of inventories would rise again in the coming quarter for the same reason. You have got these longer lead time products that were still being built as the demand shut off and pushed out deferred? 
George Davis: What I said was that we believe that all of the same sort of pressures will exist in the quarter. We actually believe that we will have better inventory performance in Q2 than we had in Q1 and again we had fairly significant inventory increases in both display and EES. And we think any of the increases will be far more moderate or the decreases in those areas. 
Michael Sullivan: Well thank you for your questions. Kierra, next question please?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Hi, thank you, good evening. A question on backlog and kind of risk assessment. You have got 34% of backlog of with EES, some significant de-bookings this quarter. How you gauge the backlog risk moving forward when you consider the state of the industry.  And secondly the HCT de-bookings, the wafering de-bookings is pretty significant. Is that gone or pushed out. How are you looking at it? 
Mike Splinter: That is pushed out at this point and so it's PW for those on the call that aren't familiar with certain HCT that was the name of the company. And we acquired we call it Precision Wafering Services and that is PWS. For the backlog for PWS that was pushed outside of our 12 month window. We still see a number of customers that are actively taking tools at this time and supporting the backlog that we have. And some of the backlog we have is already shipped and just waiting to signoff. So there is a number of factors that give us comfort and remember half of the EES backlog is related to Thin Film and is fully secured and predominantly shipped. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: My question, one last question display [initial guidance] you just on display your order came down to basic and minimum level and the last cycle back in '07 you were able to maintain revenue on a high level because you are shipping the older backlog. How do you look at this cycle? Do you expect revenues will stay at this $100 million something level. And then my follow-up is on crystalline silicon equipment. I was just wondering do you guys see any ASP pressure given the slowdown in the end-market there?
George Davis: So on display on the revenue we were able to it's all revenue more moderated, and that really was more a reflection of the order and accept it’s pattern in the last downturn. This is different because of the absolute low level of capacity that some of our customers are experiencing. So we would expect revenue to go below previous lows and also orders are already down at low levels in Q1 and will go lower. So display is really in a holding pattern until customer start to see a recovery in consumer demand. 
Mike Splinter:  And what we are seeing in the crystalline silicon has really moved towards a better technology. What customers are looking for is better productivity say on (inaudible) cell systems, lines they are looking to be able handle thinner wafers which are going to help them reduce the cost of the cells. So, they are really looking now to technology and I think for us this is a very-very good thing because we know how to keep that treadmill going, and keep moving our developments from one generation to next.
Michael Sullivan:  Okay, Edward, thank you. Kierra, next question please?
Operator: Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, George your SSG gross margin that are bottomed at a much lower revenue level versus the 2001 cycle, especially relative to your peers. Is this an artifact of separating those tiers or services or is it really real?
George Davis:
 : I am not sure what your point is there?
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: The 45% gross margins on SSG, how should we think about the gross margin trajectory from here. I mean is this where the bottom is for the gross margin of the SSG business?
George Davis:  Well I think it depends on the level of revenue, I think 45% at the level of revenue we are at today is very-very strong. And I think if we make sure also when you compare us to competitors that you are taking their account of fact that we are generally a quarter ahead in terms of where our revenue is, because we revenue on shipment. But we think we made a lot of progress over the last five years reducing the cost of sales relative to our margin. And we have taken out as much as 7 to 8 points in that regard to number of step.  So, I think we are in very good shape from operating and gross margin perspective. Obviously, we had little bit of impact on the operating margin this quarter also from bad debt reserves. But the fact is, we know our operating margin really reflects our continuing investment in technology.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley:  Okay. Quick follow-up on display, are you actively engaged with the display vendors for solar thin film projects down the road?
Mike Splinter:  Anybody who is thinking about solar thin film is talking to us.
Michael Sullivan:  Thank Atif. Kierra, can we take the next question please?
Operator: Yes sir. You next question comes from the line of Tim Summers with Wunderlich Securities.
Timothy Summers - Wunderlich Securities:  Thanks and good afternoon everyone. You mentioned that your SSG orders in the quarter were about $246 million. You annualized that you had $1 billion and Mike, you said (inaudible) this year even to low end was $10 billion, which would give you a market share of 10%. I think we all know your market share is a lot higher than that. Does that suggest that orders in this quarter are perhaps unofficially low and you are going to see some sort of bounce going forward? Or how can you reconcile your (inaudible) numbers with this quarter's SSG orders? Thanks.
Mike Splinter:  Well, I don’t know that I can reconcile the $10 billion to $12 billion with this quarter's orders for you. And you can't measure market share on a quarterly basis. So, I think you know where our market share is closer to 20% of WFE. So, this quarter, people have stopped ordering. It is as unusual as certainly anybody I have talked to in this industry has seen. This is the worst downturn in the history of semiconductor equipment business. So, now what's going to happen from here, I think it is premature to say that there is going to be some bounce back, I won't say that, no one is seeing what I am seeing today. I would like to see one of course, what we need to see one to get to $10 billion, yes, so the borders are just incredibly and unusually low.
George Davis:  Tim, did you have follow-up?
Timothy Summers - Wunderlich Securities: I am fine, thanks.
Michael Sullivan:  Okay, thank you. Kierra, please?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Berenbaum with Auriga USA. 
Daniel Berenbaum - Auriga USA: Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for taking my call. I understand you don’t give the guidance, but just to give me some perspective on visibility. How much of your business now is turns business, and how much would you normally have visibility on quarter ahead. And then follow-up question is when you talk about wafer fab equipments are going to be $10 billion to $12 billion. It sounds like one customer could be 30% or more of that wafer fab equipment spending, may be a second customer brings you up to a 50% of that. I mean are you seeing any issues from that concentration of spending at your top two or three customers?
George Davis:  Yeah, I would say certainly the turns business is a factor, but I don't know that I could tell you it's any materially different than is at various times, because it fluctuates so much based on where we are in the cycle. So I wouldn’t take anything from the drawdown of backlog in this environment.
Mike Splinter:  On a concentration, this has been a movement for a number of years now. 10 yearsis probably to a smaller number of customers having a big part of the WFE spend. This particular downturn, I think will cause that to further get concentrated. We have been focusing for quite some time on those key areas where the R&D decisions are being made. So for those I think if you pick the top five customers that spend capital in the semiconductor area, you get to a very high percentage of our revenues. We have been concentrating on the R&D areas where the decisions are being made for a several years now to enhance our share and position.
Michael Sullivan:  Dan, thank you. Kierra?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest:  Hi, I just had a follow-up in response to a Satya's question earlier, you mentioned that equipment has been shipped to eight SunFab factories, but that’s the same number you mentioned two quarters ago and now that have signed off three SunFab why haven't you shipped to any more customers?
George Davis:  See, we do have some additional equipments shipping to two more customers and actually two more factories I should say, and that will begin in actually this quarter, so it’s just the function of the timing and the readiness of the factories.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest:  Okay. And so future customers are moving ahead with plans, or do you have any customers that are postponing their SunFab plans?
George Davis:  We have already said that, we have a number of customers that are experiencing financing issues, and so those customers are working out their financing arrangements and then a number of our customers have had fully secured financing going into this, and they are proceeding ahead essentially on schedule. And that’s where our focus is right now, and then as Mike talked about we need to see some recovery in the financing markets to get some of these other customers. And quite frankly, there is a large backlog of customers prior to the really the poor economic crisis back in the pipeline.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest: Okay, thanks. 
Michael Sullivan: Thanks, West. Kierra? 
Operator:   Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup:  George, can you actually break inventory out by product group?
Mike Splinter:  We have. We can provide that information. Essentially, I think it's probably more instructive to talk about it this way. If you look at semiconductor systems, they are down about a $100 million year-over-year, and their inventory as you would expect in this environment. It's really display that has grown year-over-year and EES, driven really not only by the addition of the crystalline silicon businesses, but predominantly by SunFab, where we have grown year-over-year. We are also seeing AGS with slight increases of inventory and that really was a function of the dramatic falloff in their revenue relative to what their normal demand signals would have told them. But those things are all being worked and so I think really I think people focus on the inventory you really have to take a look at growth our EES business, which adds about $600 million of inventory year-over-year to the company.
Michael Sullivan:  Thanks Tim. Kierra, we have time for one more one question and then we will give our concluding remarks, please.
Operator: Your final question will come from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Hey, thanks. Just a quick question on $321 million orders for EES how many SunFab launch did you guys spoken to last quarter?
Mike Splinter:  We did not make a SunFab contract in the last quarter, we did have orders, George what was?
George Davis :  We had approximately $120 million in orders related to orders related to SunFab projects.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Okay.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Great, thanks.
Michael Sullivan:  Thanks, Edwin. And what we would like to do is to thank everyone for joining us on the call this afternoon. A replay of this call and a supporting slide package will be available on our website today, beginning at 5:00 pm Pacific Time. And we will keep it there posted until February 25th. So thank you for you continued interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

John Nunziati: Good afternoon and welcome to the Applied Materials fiscal 2008 fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. I am stepping in as Robert [Freeze] is sick today with laryngitis. I would like to highlight that we will be hosting our 2009 analyst day on Wednesday, February 18th, in New York City. More details on this event will be provided soon, but please note it on your calendar. Joining me on the call today are Mike Splinter, President and CEO, George Davis, Chief Financial Officer and Joe Sweeney, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Today we will discuss our results for the period ending October 26, 2008. The financial results were released this afternoon at 1:05pm Pacific Time. A copy of the news release is available on business wire and on our website, www.appliedmaterials.com. Mike Splinter will lead off the call with commentary on the market environment and our strategies for 2009. George will follow with a discussion on our financial performance for the full year and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and then provide our target for the first fiscal quarter of 2009. After Mike and George’s remarks we will open the call for questions.  With that I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike.
Michael R. Splinter:  Let me begin by thanking our employees for their excellent work and meeting the challenges of a volatile quarter. Their accomplishments throughout the year position the company well in both our core business and new markets.  The last six weeks of turmoil in the financial markets is unprecedented and the weakening global economy will have significant impact on all of Applied’s businesses. The market for semiconductors and flat panel displays depend largely on consumer demand and for growth. The current negative trend in consumer spending and economic uncertainty have led our customers to reassess their spending plans and we are seeing a pattern of multiple downward revisions as a severity of the situation sets in. Applied Materials is taken action based on our view that this will be an extended downturn lasting a year or longer. There will be significant changes in our semi-conductor customer base as the industry emerges. First, we intend to focus on executing our core strategies while improving efficiency and reducing spending. Second, we will invest aggressively in the technology, products and customer relationships that are essential for us to emerge in a stronger market position. Third, we will be disciplined, selective and patient in pursuing strategic acquisition opportunities and Fourth we have a strong balance sheet and we will remain focused on operational cash flow and asset management to preserve its strength and maintain our flexibility to support strategic business priorities. In silicon systems although visibility is extremely limited, the trends we are seeing today suggest that wafer fab equipment spending will be down more than 25% in 2009. In display we expect cap ex to be down more than 40% year-over-year. Almost daily we are hearing customer reports of factory slowdowns, closures and capacity reductions as they deal with the dramatic falloff and demand or their products. To date the macro-economic liquidity issues have had less media effect on our solar business, however, we expect a period of pullback and reassessment in early ’09. Our crystalline and silicon customers have a large exposure to consumer demand and even with strong government support we expect a reduction in consumer discretionary spending to impact demand and pricing for solar modules. Our thin film solar customers have received equipment and are expected to continue their projects as planned. For our thin film solar customers in the process of securing financing, we are seeing some delays as those financing issues are sorted out. Overall, we do expect 2009 to be a significant growth year for our solar business group. As a result of the macro environment initial reductions we are seeing in capital spending, we are taking significant action on our cost structure. Applied will begin implementing restructuring programs in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 designed to streamline the organization, reduce operating costs and drive annualized cost savings of approximately $400 million. As part of this program, the company plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 12%. We believe these actions while significant in size and impact will not impair our investment in strategic priorities. I will now make a few comments on each of our businesses. In 2008 silicon systems made gains and positioned etched for wins at the next technology node. At the same time efficiency in both R&D and operations dramatically improved, enabling solid financial performance throughout the year. In the semiconductor market, ongoing memory over supply is resulting in weak pricing and numerous closures of 200 millimeter lines. For logic and founder factories we are seeing utilization declining rapidly to less than 70% in many factories as demand for cell phones, TV’s and automobiles drop off. We expect utilization to continue to fall through the first half of ’09. Our strategy going forward is to build on our strengths, lead on innovation through focused R&D investment and win the key technology decisions as semi-conductor devices scale to 32 and 22 nanometers. For Applied Global Services, we build solid gains throughout 2008, especially in Asia and with our solar customers. This momentum for service will continue as customers move to outsource in difficult times and look for ways to maximize their factory efficiency. In display while softening consumer demand has delayed capacity expansions, it has many factories idling capacity strategic investments for Gen10 are still moving forward. While maintaining our leadership in CVD and color filter PVD, display also recognized its first revenue from the pivot PVD array system at a leading customer, opening up a large new served available market for us. Our moves in solar this year culminated in the first customer signoff of the SunFab production line in October, an important milestone. We currently have five SunFab customers producing panels. We signed another major SunFab contract in Q4. Our conversion efficiency in factory productivity are improving in our uniform across the SunFab network. We are on track with our tandem junction technology development. We are confident we can continue to lower the cost of solar energy to the scale and effectiveness of our SunFab Thin Film technology and over time make a solar meaningful part of the world’s energy supply.  I would also like to acknowledge the US Congress for approving a new and improved investment tax credit. The US incentive paves the way for utility scale investment over the next eight years in the world’s largest electricity market. While development of this market will take time, we expect investments to grow in the US during the next year and we look forward to the Obama administration’s focus on renewable energy. None of us can predict how the global economy will eventually play out, but we are taking steps to ensure Applied Materials are appropriately restructured, operating efficiently and executing on our strategic priorities. I will now turn the call over to George to add operational and financial details to our results. 
George S. Davis:  As this is our year-end call, I will cover results for both the fourth quarter and the full year. In Q4 Applied performed at the high end of our target range for orders and exceeded our revenue and EPS guidance. Orders of $2.2 billion were driven by growth in silicon systems and energy and environmental solutions, offset by an expected significant order decline in display and an 8% decline in Applied Global Services. Backlog increased to $4.85 billion, backlog adjustments were negative at $65 million and comprised $20 million of the bookings primarily related to cancellations and adjustments from non solar EES customers and $45 million of unfavorable currency adjustments. Revenue growth of 11% quarter-over-quarter was led by EES with strong sales and crystalline silicon solar. Earnings per share of $0.17 was up over 40% and reflected strong operating performance in our core businesses and cost management. Approximately $0.03 resulted in the gain on sale of our administrative office building in Singapore and certain other non-recurring items. In our segment results, silicon systems orders in Q4 increased 40% over Q3 in line with our call for our orders to be up more than 30%. Expected strength and logic was augmented by a few large orders from DRAM customers. This was a highly concentrated order quarter coming off a low base in Q3. Our order composition was DRAM 48%, logic and other 40%, foundries 9% and flash at 3%. While SSG net sales were essentially flat in Q3, operating income improved to just under 24% of net sales. In AGS, orders and revenue were impacted by a lower factory utilization in semi-conductor and display factories and dropped 8% and 13% respectively versus Q3. Sales of spares and refurbished systems were most heavily impacted in this environment. In display orders fell significantly as forecasted dropping over 80% in Q3 as display customers pushed out capital investments. Display achieved record net sales of $334 million during the fourth quarter, a 7% increase from Q3. Operating profits were up in line with revenue. Energy and environmental solutions had a strong fourth quarter with orders up 52% and revenue up 151% driven by strength in crystalline silicon and thin film solar. As Mike indicated Applied recognized the first revenue on a SunFab integrated production line in the fourth quarter. Revenue in crystalline silicon benefitted by approximately $100 million, from a combination of deferred revenue capture and the inclusion of an extra month of PWS results, to align with Applied’s fiscal period. The absence of these benefits will be a factor in Q1. Operating cash flow for the quarter was 6% of revenue. Cash flow from operations was impacted by the required bill in inventory for EES and display and during the quarter we spent $300 million on share repurchase and $80 million on dividends. We are planning to temporarily put our stock and purchase program on hold until the economic situation moderates. We see this as a prudent step to ensure that we maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility in this environment.  Cash flow performance for fiscal 2008 was strong and we generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations or 21% of revenue. This performance is notable given the reduced level of earnings and increases in inventory of almost $700 million to meet the ramps in our solar and display businesses. For fiscal 2008, orders were down 5% at $9.2 billion and revenue was off 16.5% at $8.1 billion. Our results reflected strong performance in EES and display that partially offset the impacts of a memory led cyclical downturn in silicon systems. The company’s fiscal 2008 operating profits were $1.33 billion or 16.4% of revenue with non-GAAP basis operating profits of $1.69 billion or 20.8% of revenue. This is very strong performance in a year where our most profitable segment was in a deep cyclical downturn and EES experienced an operating loss of nearly $200 million to support the startup of our solar business. GAAP net income of $961 million was down 44% from the prior year due to the reduction in revenue and the mix effects of revenue losses in SSG. Earnings per share for the year were $0.70 down 42% in line with lower net income. Now, I will briefly summarize the segment performance for the full fiscal year. SSG delivered strong financial performance despite a negative order in revenue trend. Operating margin performance was 31% or six points higher in fiscal 2005 when SSG’s annual revenue was 10% higher. This stronger performance reflects continuing improvement in manufacturing productivity and material cost reductions as well as lower operating expenses. Despite a decline in our core semiconductor markets over the year, AGS maintained revenue at the $2.3 billion level. The fall off in refurbished equipment and spares was partially offset with higher contract service revenues resulting from improved market penetration in Asia. Strong end market demand for flat panel televisions going in to fiscal 2008 led to a record year for display in orders, revenues and operating profit. Revenue increased by 38% driven primarily by our leadership position in CVD.  Operating profits increased considerably from 23% of revenue in 2007 to 32% in 2008. In fiscal 2008 EES revenue grew to more than $800 million, up from $165 million in 2007. The major drivers for this increase were the crystalline and silicon solar products obtained in the HCT and Baccini acquisitions.  Going in to fiscal 2009, as Mike outlined, a deterioration of the global financial markets has led to a rapid slowdown in many of our customer’s investment plans. Our cost reduction program is targeted to generate overall annualized savings of $400 million with global headcount reductions of 1,800 positions or approximately 12%. We believe this will lower annual operating expenses by approximately $325 million and cost of sales by $75 million. We intend to move swiftly on this program and to capture the reduction in our run rate by fiscal year end. These savings are incremental to the actions we took early in 2007 that resulted in annualized spending reductions of $150 million. Before I outline our Q1 targets, I’d like to reiterate some of the key market issues that impact our outlook. We expect that the environment for semiconductor and display equipment demand will remain uncertain for quite some time and that volatility in our customer forecast will be very high. Based on today’s limited visibility and given the strong order performance in our fourth fiscal quarter, we see overall company orders down in Q1 by more than 30% as customers put spending plans on hold. Going forward, we intend to discontinue our practice of providing company order guidance until the level of volatility subsides. We will continue to provide actual orders in our reporting. This quarter we will also be widening the ranges somewhat for revenue and EPS where we are also subject to uncertainty but have better visibility than we do for orders. Overall, we expect that the silicon segment will face further weakening in its markets and that revenue will fall 25% or more over the next quarter. We also see display revenues dropping off substantially as customers push out equipment on order. AGS sales will be down although less than the equipment markets but demand for spares and refurbished equipment will be impacted by low utilization rates. We see healthy growth for EES in fiscal ’09 but are forecasting some revenue fall off in Q1 in our EES segment due to the absence of $100 million of positive adjustments in Q4 that I mentioned earlier and also from softening demand in crystalline and silicon.  We do expect to receive at least one and possibly two SunFab signoffs in Q1. With that as a backdrop our fiscal Q1 targets are we expect overall revenue to be down in the range of 25% to 30%. We expect EPS to be in the range of $0.00 to $0.04 per share. John, let’s open up the call for questions.
John Nunziati: Please note that during the Q&A we ask that you limit your request to one question and one follow up per firm. Let’s begin with the first question.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from James Covello – Goldman Sachs. 
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: My first question would be on the DRAM segment and Mike you referenced in the beginning that you think coming out of the other side of this your customer base in semiconductors could look very different. Do you have any thoughts about how DRAM and particularly Taiwan DRAM comes out of the other side of this given the severity of this down turn and what your customer base could look like again, particularly in Taiwan DRAM on the other side of this cycle.
Michael R. Splinter : Well, I think it’s really a worldwide question Jim and in part in Taiwan it will depend a little bit on what the government does there but I think we see two fewer, maybe three fewer companies in this space at the end of the down turn. I think initially in this last year we expected consolidation, this kind of global recession is going to pretty much ensure it happens.
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: Obviously customer consolidation isn’t usually great for suppliers, but what’s your take on that?
Michael R. Splinter : Well, it will I think make things more rational. You know what the pricing is like in the DRAM world over the last two years. I think if there’s fewer suppliers the market will be a little more orderly and I think that, in the long run is a positive. 
James Covello – Goldman Sachs: If I could get my follow up, it would be around the solar segment particularly with the SunFabs. What kinds of things do you think need improvement in order to get quicker customer sign off going forward? What kinds of things do you guys still believe you need to work on other than the tandem junction technology, maybe logistical support as you install the SunFabs or whatever other issues you guys still feel that you need to improve to get quicker sign up.
Michael R. Splinter : Signups doesn’t really have anything to do with tandem junction, the first number of factories are single junction factories. Just moving up the learning curve Jim. You start up factories, you learn an awful lot of detailed issues, every one of them has to be resolved but the good thing is we resolve them once, we learn, we move it to the next factory and each one will be faster and faster as we move through time. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin – UBS. 
Stephen Chin – UBS: Two questions on the solar profitability, I guess the first is do you think it’s reasonable to model improving operating margins in that solar division as we go through fiscal 2009? And, the second question to that is, is today’s restructuring program impact applied solar division and if so with the solar workforce reductions be similar to the rest of the company?
George S. Davis : In terms of the operating profit, I think we saw this quarter that you had a fair amount of additional revenue coming in, in the area where we’re having the highest margins right now in the solar in the crystalline silicon group so that was a positive that we said will reverse itself in next quarter when we get to a more normalized revenue level.  2009 is still going to be a working out year for us because it’s when we’re going to be going through and experience essentially the full learning curve as we roll through the initial SunFab sign offs. So, I think we’ll just have to see for the full year where the crystalline silicon side comes out. We have strong backlog in that area and then depending on how well demand holds up in that regard. That will be a positive for profitability or if we see a big pull back that will have an impact negatively. Then in terms of the cost reduction programs, every one of our operating executives has a target. They’re working their programs right now. I’m not going to comment on the waiting. Obviously, certain areas have more end market demand issues to sort out than others but we’re confident that we can execute on this cost reduction program and we’ll have plans out this quarter.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Patrick Ho – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.
Patrick Ho – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:  In terms of your cash flow going forward you mentioned that you’re going to be focused on strategic investments. Just given where the stock price is at are you still not finding any I guess use for it in the near term in terms of the stock buy back?
George S. Davis : Clearly we think there’s value in our stock and we have great confidence in our long term business plan. We just think that it’s prudent at this time to preserve the cash that we would spend in share repurchase to make sure that we have basically control of our own destiny. We have a very strong balance sheet coming in to this situation. We’re probably better positioned than we’ve ever been and we want to make sure that as we go through this thing until we really see how deep an how difficult it is to navigate this particular economy that we have the flexibility to maintain that we have going in.
Patrick Ho – Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.: In terms of your semicap orders, we have one logic customer that’s beginning its next generation ramp on the 32 nanometer node. Without I guess giving exact details of how they’re going to order, does that provide you any near term support over the next few quarters on that business front?
Michael R. Splinter : Well it does of course and you can understand if you kind of look at our picture that a big part of the overall orders and revenue are from the top four customers and really that was in part why our Q4 looked as good as it did.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities:
Best:
Best:
George S. Davis : Let me just clarify something, there hasn’t been equipment shipped to Best Solar. Now, Best Solar is building out their factories and that may be what you’re thinking about. Equipment that is shipped to our customers, and we shipped basically full shipped to seven customers and are in the process of shipping to eight, those are all secured by letters of credit, that customers are moving ahead. They had to have their financing in place to be at this stage so they’re moving ahead on schedule.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: I guess just sort of following on, what if a customer is unable to complete a SunFab project? You say you have letters of credit but do you get a substantial portion up front as a down payment that might offset potential [inaudible]?
George S. Davis : Yes, we are more than fully secured for everything that is shipped today so our basic structure for these, they’re working capital intensive as you know, is deposits up front and then prior to shipment to have everything fully secured.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: Then just on the crystalline silicon solar side, last quarter you mentioned you were around a $200 million a quarter shipment run rate. It sounds like potentially weakening demand on the crystalline silicon side. What do you think might be a low point for the shipment rate through next year?
George S. Davis : I’m not ready to make that call. We haven’t had cancellations as you saw from the debookings, you didn’t see anything there from the crystalline silicon side. What’s really been the phenomena is recently trying to catch up revenue with the shipment rates. That’s really where we are now, we’re caught up and so it will be, as we work through our backlog we’ve been running it at about the $200 million rate a quarter and until there’s cancellations that’s our assumption.
Michael R. Splinter : And remember, if people are going to bring on silicon capacity, they have to saw and shape the wafers and it has to be able to process them. I don’t think that says much about what the end demand is going to be like or when an adjustment would take place but I don’t think we’re in a position to make a solid forecast out a couple of quarters.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Analyst for Jay Deahna – J.P. Morgan. 
Analyst for Jay Deahna – J.P. Morgan: Just two quick questions, first, how many SunFab lines did you book this quarter? And, how many do you expect next quarter? Then, I have a follow up.
George S. Davis : We don’t forecast but we booked one SunFab line this quarter. 
Analyst for Jay Deahna – J.P. Morgan: And would you expect that or more next quarter?
George S. Davis : We don’t forecast out on the SunFab orders.
Analyst for Jay Deahna – J.P. Morgan: Then could we get some more specifics on your tandem junction [inaudible] line? Do you have working panels at 8% efficiency and when do you expect [inaudible]?
Michael R. Splinter : Well, do we internally to Applied Materials? Yes. But, we can’t comment on what a customer has working. But, we’re happy with where our technology is moving and how fast it’s moving ahead. The schedule for that factory sign off is in our second quarter. We think that’s very much on schedule and going to happen.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Kirsh Sankar – Banc of America Securities.
Kirsh Sankar – Banc of America Securities: I had two questions, one is given the dislocations in the solar market can Applied capitalize on those and move downstream like leveraging [inaudible] and investing in other things? Or, is the plan in ’09 just to focus on executing on the equipment part of the business?
Michael R. Splinter : Our strategy first and foremost is to focus on our equipment and turnkey and technology business. We think this is the fastest way to scale solar energy around the world and drive the pricing down. Will we do some downstream demonstrations, those kinds of things? They’re for us, at this point, more marketing than business process to help create the demonstration that this is a business people can make money at and as cost effective to install and I think we’re demonstrating those things around the world.
Kirsh Sankar – Banc of America Securities: In terms of your guidance for orders down over 30% can you just give us some granularity on the breakout between how low silicone could be?
George S. Davis : We think it will be down significantly but we’re not going to break it out much more than that for the same reason we’re not giving order guidance. The ability to forecast at the start of a quarter when our own customers forecasts are dropping or is as volatile as we’re seeing them. We wanted to give you some indication directionally of where it looks overall, but I think we’re going to just leave it at that at this point.
Kirsh Sankar – Banc of America Securities: Just a quick follow on, how many $100 million plus orders did you have in the October quarter?
George S. Davis : Let me just put it to you this way, we had four orders, four customers I should say that comprised 70% of the total orders that we had in silicone. That was the big piece. We had a SunFab order that was also larger than $100 million. I think that should give you an idea of the concentration.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Two things, first of all it looks like pricing for crystalline modules was thought to come down about 20% next year but really it looks like it’s going to be about 20% just in Q1. So, I’m wondering the pricing rabbit and the cost rabbit that you thought you were chasing, i.e. where you thought pricing would be for crystalline modules out two or so years from today, does that rapid rate of pricing decline change how you think about solar and how you might have to get more aggressive in terms of cutting price to get cap ex per watt down?
Michael R. Splinter : Actually no. You know, crystalline silicon pricing has been very stable for a long time. Any approach, any modeling that we’ve done in this business, we’ve always thought that pricing had to come down 20% a year on average to really start getting this technology in to the space where it can eventually be competitive with other forms of electricity generation. So, the fact that because of silicon shortage, pricing has been stable for multiple years really doesn’t change how strategically we think about this business or the targets that we’ve set internally for ourselves.  We know where we have to get to. The target is other forms of electricity generation, it’s not some internal solar target necessarily. As far as pricing, we know we have to keep driving the technology to get more efficient, more productive and that’s where we’re going to keep the market growing.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: I guess as a quick follow up, I’ve actually asked you this before but, given the current credit issues, does it make you rethink your business model in solar at all potentially going more vertical and not relying on customers that are in turn so reliant on financing?
Michael R. Splinter : Well, it’s hard for us to think about crossing the line of competing with customers. If that’s what you’re inferring Tim. I think there’s lots of opportunity in the solar market in various bases to help increase demand but I think for right now we want to stay focused. If we really see the business change maybe we’d reevaluate but I think we still see enough interest in our products and turnkey factories that we’re going to do quite well in this market over time.
George S. Davis : Also, at the end of the day Tim, it’s not our balance sheet that would drive the value equation there. It’s ultimately what’s the end market demand and do you have the utilities coming in, do you have the broader government subsidies. These are very financeable arrangements if the demand is right and if the demand isn’t right there’s no amount of balance sheet that’s going to solve that problem.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: George and Mike, I’m a little surprised that you saw significant increase in Taiwan DRAM orders. I was wondering if you could give me some color on whether these orders are for technology buys or capacity, some kind of trends to stack conversions or just stack capacity? Are you looking to ship these products in the next one or two quarters or do the ship dates extend beyond the next couple of quarters?
Michael R. Splinter : Well, there’s a complex question but, yes it’s for both technology and capacity in Taiwan. Some of the orders are for conversion so kind of the answer to your question is all of the above. 
George S. Davis : As I said, these were very concentrated orders and as I said 70% came from four customers but 30% of the total order book that we got for Q4 in silicon turned in the quarter and another 25% of it is going to turn in the next quarter so we’ve got a big piece of the flow through just in basically the first quarter of ’09 and then some will stretch on out to the later part of the year.
Michael R. Splinter : But our aging and our backlog is not particularly moving. 
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Mike, I think earlier on your prepared comments you made a comment that you’re suspending the buyback and you might look to be more aggressive on the acquisition front? I was wondering if you could add a little bit more color to that? Are you primarily looking in the silicon part or are you looking to make more acquisitions in the EES as you look to grow the business longer term?
Michael R. Splinter : I’ll comment on the acquisition and let George comment on the buyback. Actually, what I said was we’re going to be disciplined and patient about acquisitions. I’m quite happy with the capability we’ve developed in the company to do acquisitions and I think we want to be very selective. I think we’re going to say no many more times than we’ll say yes.  We think that there’s going to be lots of opportunity for acquisitions but what we’re going to try to do is be very strategic in both our semiconductor space and our solar space to see where there’s technology or products that will add to our offering and really make a strategic difference to the company. As you know, doing an acquisition takes a lot of management bandwidth. We want to make sure the ones that we do are really going to have impact. I wouldn’t say that we’re going to be overly selective on one business unit or another. We’re going to weight it on strategic impact to the company.
George S. Davis : On share repurchase I’ll just reiterate the fact that as you know we have been a strong proponent of share repurchases as a way of returning excess cash to shareholders so no change in that philosophical bias. Also, no change in our view that we’re a very attractive long term investment and certainly at the kind of levels today you just feel very comfortable.  The fact is we want to use the balance sheet and maintain a very strong balance sheet to make sure that as we emerge from this that we are as strong as we can be in terms of the technology that we’ve maintained or acquired, in terms of the investments that we’ve made through this difficult period and we think prudence on preserving cash at this time, particularly since it’s really not known how deep this economic set back can go. We think it makes more sense to be prudent and hold off until that sorts itself out. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from C. J. Muse – Barclays Capital.
C. J. Muse – Barclays Capital: I guess first question, on the solar front how should we think about the revenue mix between crystalline and silicon and thin film as we progress throughout calendar year ’09?
George S. Davis : Today crystalline silicon dominates the revenue picture in EES and it should even out by the end of the year, be more of an even mix. Again, I think that’s assuming that things play out the way we see them today. Forecasting has been a very difficult process in this environment but that’s how we see it today.
C. J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Then I guess second follow up questions there, when you look at 2009 and clearly it looks like solar is possibly the only growth area within your different segments, and that becoming more important in terms of an earnings driver and without the benefit of this $100 million deferred revenue that was supported this quarter. When should we see that segment reach profitability? 
George S. Davis : I think honestly we have to take a look at how customers react to this environment to answer that question. I mean we believed last time we updated on this that 2009 would be the year that we would be GAAP breakeven. Just to remind you we carried in ’08 $120 million of acquisition charges in the EES segment so there’s a big nut there that has to be worked through on a GAAP basis. On an operating basis performance has been obviously substantially better than what you see in the reported segment.  So, we’ll have to see really how the demand situation plays out whether that forecast is still valid and we certainly will have a complete update and view on that at the analyst meeting scheduled for New York. But, we’ll also have more information obviously as we get in to the end of next quarter.
C. J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Is there a certain revenue level that would drive breakeven that you could share with us?
George S. Davis : No, I think what you’re seeing today with the mix that they have today, that kind of revenue level they were clearly breakeven. But, again I think it will depend on mix and we’ll just have to see. But, we feel very good about the long term business model for the solar group. Inherently the products are profitable and the SunFab model we think is an excellent one and once we get through the basic learning costs should generate the kind of operating margins that we forecasted for 2010 and beyond.
C. J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Ong – American Technology Research. 
Bill Ong – American Technology Research: Based on your conversations with your chip customers, do you have an industry forecast of what global chip revenue should be next year? Flat, down, someway of quantifying it? Then more importantly do you have a sense of what the base line type of spending is needed just to keep the global fabs running?
Michael R. Splinter : Bill, you’re asking for our forecast on chip sales? 
Bill Ong – American Technology Research: If you understand the chip revenue and then you sort of get a sense of capital intensity for a way of figuring out what type of spending is needed.
Michael R. Splinter : We think that in 2009 chip sales will be down some place 5% to 10%. That’s kind of our view at this point. Obviously, I’d say our visibility on that is pretty low but that’s our view at the current time. When there’s less sales in the chip world there’s little need for added capacity. 
Bill Ong – American Technology Research: Do you think the capital intensity will probably still be at the 16% to 18% of revenue?
Michael R. Splinter : I don’t even know how to forecast that when units are down.
George S. Davis : Plus, capacity utilization is down so much. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray.
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: Are you starting to see some production of single junction panels from some customers and I’m wondering what type of cost per watt these customers are seeing relative to the cost road map you communicated the analyst community?
George S. Davis : In the initial phases here we’re seeing roughly $1.50 a watt. This is very early as these panels start getting in to higher volumes and the factories run more efficiently we’ll see that continue to come down. We’re pretty happy with where we are, we’re pretty much on track with where we thought we would be.
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: As a follow up, another solar equipment company demonstrated that a good chunk of its solar backlog is backed up with revocable LCs and cash deposits and I think the number was about 50% of their backlog and this is GT Solar I’m talking about. I’m wondering is there any kind of metric that you can share with us of how your solar backlog is protected there with LCs or deposits?
George S. Davis : We have, as we talked about for SunFab, we have a policy of being fully covered as we ship in and all of our eight factories where we’ve shipped equipment so far were fully secured for all of the equipment and the sign off value for the factories. Then it’s been a practice on the crystalline silicon side to take deposits and to secure credit where credit is necessary, customers commitments.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: If I look at your orders over the two quarter period, your orders on an absolute basis are actually in line with your peers so is it fair to assume that your quarter was a backend loaded for silicon?
George S. Davis : I think that’s fair because I think we would expect some of our competitors to have seen some of these orders in there next quarter they report.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: George, can you comment on the linearity of the operating expense cut over the year, how should we think about modeling it?
George S. Davis : We’re going to try and obviously address the headcount reductions as expeditiously as possible and other spending reductions but we don’t have it scaled out obviously. But, I would think in the first half of the year we would try and get at least half way out the gate and we’ll see.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Mike, just your kind of general comment about thin film continuing their projects as planned despite some financing delays. That’s kind of tough to believe given where oil is right now and given the difficulties with kind of bigger mainstream companies getting financing. Are you really referring just to the near term and kind of your basket of five to seven customers? Or, are you indeed really talking about the entire industry as a whole?
Michael R. Splinter : Let me clarify there, what I said was for those customers that we’ve already shipped equipment to, we see those projects staying on schedule. For those that are still working through their financing I said that I thought there would be some delay as they both have financing issues and maybe they have other project issues but I tend to focus right now on more of the financial situation. But, remember also that the feed in tariffs in Europe have not subsided and they’ll be increasing tariffs in Japan. We have obviously a new incentive tax credit in the US. We have a new administration in the US. China will do something on renewable energy in their infrastructure package so how all these things play out over the next year exactly I’m not sure but I don’t expect that oil prices specifically are going to have a whole lot of affect on solar energy.  Very little electricity is generated by oil, most is generated by coal and natural gas. But, it doesn’t matter, in the end we’ve got to keep driving the cost down and get the cost competitive with all forms of electricity. That’s in the end the goal.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: One question here for George real quick, George I really don’t understand the hesitancy in reiterating your profitability guidance for solar next year and basically also the sort of secrecy surrounding what your breakeven is. You look right now and obviously you’re trying to guide us to not model a breakeven at roughly around $450 million but given obviously a 50/50 mix that you really kind of talked about in ’09 and kind of rolling off this benefit I guess off of slightly higher margins off that $100 million in deferred revenue recognition, I mean what is the kind of ballpark number we should be looking at, at more a 50/50 crystalline silicon mix? Is it $500, $600, $700, just give us some help there?
George S. Davis : Clearly, you saw a breakeven this quarter. First off, I think we’ve been exceedingly transparent in our discussion on this and so my view is forecasting the profitability for 2009 when there’s a key dependency on crystalline silicon when we’re not prepared to forecast crystalline silicon for the full year, is just premature. So, we’ll keep you posted, we know it’s an important issue.  Again, we’re very interested in reaching profitability as rapid as possible and we’re taking whatever steps necessary to get there. We’ll keep you posted, it’s really more of a hesitancy to try and forecast a full year of crystalline silicon.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Just a quick follow up, I can understand the hesitancy and visibility, I mean Intel just basically cut their guidance one more time here. But, if I strip out that $100 million in deferred revenue out of EES in the October quarter, what would have been the profitability there?
George S. Davis : It would not have been profitable.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini – Freidman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.
Mehdi Hosseini – Freidman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: This morning one of these cell manufacturers talking about shutting down 40% of their lines, I expect some of the other public silicon crystalline based manufacturers to also start shutting down lines. Is that already been factored in to your comment that crystalline and thin film bookings are going to even out by sometime next year.
Michael R. Splinter : I don’t know whether we’ve incorporated something that happened this morning but we certainly incorporated everything that we know from the customers that we have and what they’ve order from us at the current time.
George S. Davis : Right. It’s really more a reflection of current backlog and the fact that we didn’t have any customer cancellations in Q4. The mix of that can change as our forecast could change based on things that we learn over the next several months.
Mehdi Hosseini – Freidman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: I guess the better question is, is booking for silicon solar business declining or would you expect it to go up?
George S. Davis : We expect bookings for silicon systems to go down in Q1, clearly.
Michael R. Splinter : He’s asking about crystalline [inaudible].
George S. Davis : On the bookings side I’m not going to guide to the individual areas at this point.
Mehdi Hosseini – Freidman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: Then when I look at your guidance for the [inaudible] as you’re up to $0.04 and the kind of revenue range that you’re guiding to kind of gives you a sense of what the EPS breakeven is. I do understand you don’t want to provide any guidance on the breakeven point but for the purpose of modeling as we try to factor in the 12% workforce reduction, how should we think about the drop through or incremental change in op ex?
George S. Davis : Sure, no. The other question was about breakeven for EES segment. We are happy to talk about breakeven for Applied Materials overall. I mean, you can see from our guidance today that if you look at the low end of our EPS guidance range and you match that up with the low level of our revenue range, that gets you a breakeven level of around $1.3 billion a quarter.  We think by the time we fully implement the cost savings programs you can reduce that breakeven by another $150 million to $200 million.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: I have a question on silicon systems, did your revenue guidance imply that silicon systems will be down close to 50% and that puts you in the $400 kind of revenue range. It’s not an exact science but your silicon system backlog for me is coming out somewhere between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion.
George S. Davis : Let me just correct you on that, we were specific and said that we thought it could be down more than 25%. We did not use a 50% number. I’m not sure where you got that number.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: But, still your backlog for silicon system will still be much higher than what your peers have reported. Most of the companies have reported that their backlogs are running that level of their revenues. Yours is still a nice multiple of your revenue run rate.
George S. Davis : Yes, I think number one you have to take a look at the fact that we had a very strong order quarter this quarter that they have not yet experienced or put in to their backlog and I think that’s probably what would account for virtually all of the difference of what you’re seeing.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: So you think that you got some new orders which will probably book in the December quarter for other companies?
George S. Davis : No, our backlog reflects a strong Q4 ’08 and I would say that we have an extra month relative to many of our competitors and these were backend loaded orders in some cases.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Yes, but that’s what I’m saying is that would imply that your peers will have that booking so their backlog should increase in December quarter for them but nobody has guided their ’09.
George S. Davis : Yes.
Michael R. Splinter : We don’t want to speak for our competitors. 
George S. Davis : You can talk to them.
John Nunziati: Operator, we’ll take one more question and then make our closing remarks.
Operator:  Your final question comes from Raj Seth – Cowan & Company.
Raj Seth – Cowan & Company: George, forgive me if I missed this earlier but next quarter sequentially what does op ex do or can you talk about gross margin and we can figure out the other one obviously.
George S. Davis : I’m not going to guide to gross margin. Obviously we’re taking actions to keep our operating costs as low as possible so we would see them coming down and continuing to come down as we roll through the cost savings.
Raj Seth – Cowan & Company: One, if I might for Mike. Mike, given the magnitude of what’s going on do you see any of your customers, at least those you expect to survive, are they changing their pace of technology transitions in a significant way or are we still following [Moore’s] law here?
Michael R. Splinter : I think that especially in a down turn people are going to actually focus on moving to the next generation of technology faster to get products that will maybe attract more buyers. They’re going to work hard to get to that next generation of technology so I think we’re going to see [Moore’s] law continue. Maybe a slightly slower pace but nothing significant here at this current time. Everybody is going to use this time to move ahead and find new products to sell.
Raj Seth – Cowan & Company: Just a follow up to one of the earlier ones, somebody asked about capital intensity, you said last quarter in a normalized environment, clearly that’s not what we’re in, that you expected capital intensity to return to 20%ish. A couple of your peers have suggested a lower number. Any change to that 20% number that you gave last quarter?
Michael R. Splinter : Well, I think when we come out of this on the other side, if there are fewer customers the factor efficiency and the capital intensity will be down a few points. But, I think the industry will be in better shape because of it. So, I think we have to see what happens during this period before we solidify any prediction but in general that’s what I’m thinking.
John Nunziati:  We’d like to thank you for joining us in the discussion of the financial results. We’d like to remind you that a replay of this call and the supporting slide package will be available on the website starting at 5pm today and will remain posted until November 26th. Thank you for your interest in Applied Materials.
Operator:  This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Robert Friess - Vice President and Treasurer: Thank you Sarah. Good afternoon and welcome to Applied Material’s fiscal 2008 third quarter earnings call. I’m happy to be participating in this quarter’s webcast as Interim Head of Investor Relations. For those of you who have not yet met, I’m looking forward to speaking with you soon. Before we began let me remind you that we’ll be hosting an analyst briefing at the European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference in Valencia, Spain on Monday, September the 1st. More details on this event will be provided soon. Joining me on the call today are Mike Splinter, President and CEO, George Davis, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Jo Sweeney, Senior Vice President and General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.

After, George and Mike’s remarks we will open the call for questions. With that I would like to turn the call over to Mike.
Michael R. Splinter - President, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Robert. As many of you know Robert has assumed the responsibility for Investor Relations, while we recruit a new executive to lead our Investor Relations functions, Robert, thank you for stepping in. Applied Materials third quarter financial results can be characterized as optimizing our company’s performance in a challenging economic environment with a semiconductor equipment market being particularly tough. During, the quarter we saw, continued softening of world economies as oil prices spiked, credit tightened and then the US housing values fell further and unemployment increased. It’s no surprise that US consumer confidence is at its lowest level in more than a decade. Over the past few months forecast for 2008 wafer fab equipment spending moved in line with our view of down 25% to 35% year-over-year as memory prices weaken and investments were delayed. While, there were some signs of strength in the PC market that showed double-digit unit growth is not translated to investment broadly by our customer base. In this light our team executed every opportunity for orders and revenue in each of our businesses to achieve our results. The Silicon Systems Group remains focused on financial and operating results and the group performed well in the most challenging quarter since Q4 2003. Let, me highlight a few examples of the team achievements in the quarter. In mask inspection with the Aera2’s unique aerial imaging capability, we are now running production at six customers with significant wins at chip makers mask and wafer fab operations. Interest in this new product continues to be strong and in bright field inspection our U-vision product is in line to increase shipments by 60% in fiscal ‘08. In edge we’re focused on becoming the tool of record in key applications for critical dimension control in high aspect ratio features. In these areas we racked up 23 new tool of record positions at major memory manufacturers to date in fiscal ‘08 and we expect these to translate into orders and revenue as customers move to advanced nodes over the next year. Our heart gap feel solution won a production tool of record position at a major flash manufacture due to a superior performance at the high aspect ratios needed to shallow trench isolation applications. Another important win came as epi earned positions, a two major logic manufacturers, gaining share and making our selectively epi solution to virtual industry standard. As memory transitions to copper interconnects, we expect gains in copper PVD applications and Applied is well positioned at nearly all flash and DRAM development lines making that transition this year. Overall, in SSG bookings for the fourth quarter are moving positively and should increase by more than 30% from the floor in Q3. Despite having all-time record revenue quarter, inching past $310 million as we delivered the largest volume of product in our display groups history. At the same time we recorded revenue on the first PiVot rate PVD systems. PiVot significantly improves target utilization to greater than 70% and lowest cost of ownership through an innovative rotary target concept. For energy and environmental solutions revenues doubled and orders were up 25% in the quarter. Our focus in crystal and silicon over the past several months has been the bill production capability to meet the rapid expansion of product demand in our precision wafering systems and Baccini’s cell systems business units. Delivery performance is improving and we expect to be current to backlog by October. Products from PWS and BCS are market leaders and we expect to expand operations and move along the road map to reduce costs for solar cell production. A key component in reducing these costs is the use of fewer grams of silicon for each watt of output produced and Applied Materials is leading the industry in that challenge. In fact, our entire crystal and silicon product portfolio is now capable of producing wafers as thin as an average sheet of paper, only a 120 microns thick. That’s 60% thinner in today’s industry standard wafer. We’re pleased with the progress this past quarter in our SunFab thin film business. We’re in the investment cycle in this rapidly developing business and our focus is on the successful start up of our first customer’s factories. We believe our process technology and full line solution provide customers the ability to rapidly expand capacity. We’re partnering with the technology leader to provide the long-term improvement costs per watt necessary to succeed. We’re simultaneously starting up multiple SunFab lines while integrating an end to end suit of newly developed process tools. The scale and operational complexity of these lines presents a tremendous challenge, but this is just the kind of challenge that Applied Materials excels in and our teams have performed exceptionally well by drawing on the overall resources throughout the company and from among our partners to support these new factories. We now have four customers that are producing solar panels. If you saw one of these panels at inter solar in Europe or in California, you understand how overall cost efficient our 5.7 square meter form factor is for large scale solar applications. We expect to get our first SunFab signed off this quarter with more to follow in the first part of fiscal ‘09. The SunFab technology platform made dramatic progress in the quarter as our tandem junction process demonstrated production feasibility. We were pleased to learn that the European patent office just issued a provisional opinion finding invalid to key claims of a patent related to tandem junction solar technology that is the basis of a law suit recently filed against one of our solar customers. The solar industry continues to gain momentum and investment prospects remain strong with particularly rapid growth in Europe and Asia. During the quarter we announced two new contracts and one follow on for SunFab earning new customers and important emerging to solar markets like Italy and the Middle East. For SunFab interest remains strong and our customer pipeline is robust. Governments around the world are implementing policies favorable to renewable energy and helping to build a strong market for solar and we are working with US policy makers to eventually pass and sign into law an effective incentive program to build the market in America at the time when we clearly needed sensible and proactive response to the global energy crisis. Regardless of incentives however, our focus is to apply our technology in production know how to enable solar to compete with all conventional forms of electricity generation. We still expect that our fiscal Q3 was the trough in semiconductor equipment orders and revenue. However, we remain cautious in our expectations for a revenue recovery through the end of the year. We are in close communication with customers on more than 40, 300 mm projects that we believe will be going forward but under the current environment there is uncertainty around the timing of those investments. We are watching bid growth, pricing and inventory indicators in the minimal area to help judge when we will see the next wave of investment in either DRAM or Flash. Our expectations are for the industry to start adding additional NAN capacity for solid state drive applications in 2009 and beyond. Growth rates for 65-nanometer foundry capacity have been slower than expected due to design complexities. Foundries are now seeing growth in 65-nanometer revenues as the ramp gained strength and utilization exceeds 90%. In 2008, we see capital and intensity down to 15% to 16% which is below its typical range of 18% to 22%. This represents a near term correction from memory overspending, longer term we see capital intensity going back to approximately 20% over the next 1 to 2 years. After reaching historic levels in the first two quarters our orders for display products was strong at $374 million, but down 25% over Q2, we believe this represents the end of the first phase of the GEN8.5 order cycle and we should expect orders in display to be down significantly for the next few quarters until the GEN10 technology and capacity cycle begins. Meanwhile, we see the major capital projects moving ahead, the top panel makers are expanding capacity to meet demand for large TVs over the next few years despite signs of the TV market softening in a short term. We expect revenue to continue at a high level for the next few quarters. In our service business, we see much less volatility than experience in the capital equipment businesses they support. AGS has weathered the downturn in silicon and shown solid revenue and financial performance. Our service group has developed a strong proposition for expanding in Asia, signing five major contracts for silicon service and three for display in the period. Applied SunFab performance service program has strong momentum at leading solar manufacturers in Europe and in Asia. We have now exceeded a $100 million in the service contracts for both single and tandem junctions SunFab lines. In order to capitalize on growth opportunities, we are making significant investments in infrastructure to enable the company to be more cost effective and efficient and expanding capacity to meet customers’ needs. During the quarter we announced our new Asian operations center in Singapore that will primarily focus on SSG products. The expansion of our Thai None manufacturing center focused on display and solar products and we continue to invest in developing our solar reliability lab and other capabilities in Xian, China. Overall, Applied Materials is executing to our strategy in today’s difficult economic environment focused on our core businesses and silicon and service making significant R&D investments in new products and technology for the next node of integrated circuits. The display team is executing at the top of revenue cycle and expanding their product lines. Solar organization is rapidly developing capability on the two fronts of crystalline and thin film silicon products and at the same time we are investing in the right infrastructure for the future. With that, I would like to turn the call over to George to comment on the company’s result for Q3 and to provide our targets for Q4. George?
George S. Davis – Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Mike and good afternoon everyone. Applied Material delivered results that were well within our target range during the period of significant weakness for the semiconductor equipment industry and in a period of heavy investment in our burgeoning solar businesses. Our silicon business has applied strongest earnings in cash flow engine so we are pleased with the financial and operating performance achieved in the third quarter although revenue declined 40% in last segment quarter over quarter. Display and solar continue to ramp capacity and capability throughout the quarter, while our services business remained relatively strong despite the difficult environment in its major end market. During the quarter we continue to execute on our operational improvement strategies, both to address the cyclical environment as well as to achieve our long term cost road map. Now, I will summarize our performance for the third quarter. Orders of $2 billion were at the high end of our target range, as all businesses performed in line with our expectations, despite significant volatility in the underlying markets. Backlog increased to $4.7 billion, backlog adjustments for the quarter were negative at $37 million comprised of $75 million of de-bookings primarily related to cancellations from a few memory customers and $46 million of unfavorable currency adjustments partially offset by $83 million of adjustments primarily for precision wafering system orders that now meet our order recognition criteria but we were in PWS’s backlog at the time of acquisition. Bookings, for display and EES have exceeded revenue for three and six quarter respectively. Revenue, of $1.8 billion for the quarter was down $302 million or 14% which was at the midpoint of our Q3 target range of down 10% to 18%, growth into display and EES segments help mitigate the significant decline in silicon revenue. Gross margin decrease to 40.2% from 45% in Q2, the decrease is attributable to lower silicon revenue, our highest margin business along with some minor affects from lower factory absorption. It is noteworthy that our gross margin performance benefited from the substantial improvements and operating performance in SSG, which earned a gross margin in excess of 50% during the quarter. Operating expenses were $514 million down slightly from Q2 and reflect our rapid increase and spending in solar, partially offset by savings from the cost reduction plan we announced in January and lower variable compensation cost. We continue to drive each of our business groups to manage operating expenses prudently while meeting the investment requirements of their respective businesses. Operating income decreased to $228 million or 12% of revenue reflecting lower revenue levels partially offset by progress on our cost control measures and other operating performance programs. Net income was $165 million or $0.12 per share at the middle of our target range. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.17 per share with M&A charges primarily related to our solar acquisitions impacting EPS by $0.02. Let’s now look at third quarter results by segment. In silicon orders were down on decrease demand from DRAM and Flash customers. This is the first quarter in the past ten quarters that orders from memory makers accounted for less than 50% of the total semiconductor related orders, led by a significant fall off in flash memory orders. Our orders composition was logic and other 37%, DRAM 34%, foundries 20% and flash 9%. Orders for 5X nanometer and below technology represented more than 55% of semiconductor related orders. So, looking at net sales we’re down 40% from Q2 continued weakness and DRAM and flash spending were compounded further delays and foundry investment. Leading foundry utilization rates improved sequentially from the second quarter and are now higher than 92%. Silicon operating income declined to 23% of net sales due primarily to the steep decline in revenue. Operating performance continued to improve relative to historical levels showing ten points of operating margin improvement relative to Q4 of fiscal 2003, when revenue was at a similar level. The initiatives arising from the formation of a single silicon organization, the exit from underperforming products, and our cycle time and M costs improvements over time achieved by our Austin team have enabled this result. In addition, the silicon group has established the foundation for further operating leverage with supply chain and sourcing initiatives. During, the quarter we broke ground on our new Asia operation center in Singapore, which will support our merchant transit and low cost regional sourcing strategies. Energy and environmental solutions. Orders in energy and environmental solutions increased 25% over Q2 due to orders in PWS&PCS being reflected for a full quarter. We also recognized orders for two SunFab lines. EES net sales more than doubled from the Q2 level driven by higher sales of crystalline silicon solar and glass products. During Q3 we began to see real movement towards a normalized flow through of revenue from PWS&PCS. We believe the convergence will happen in the next two quarters. Our crystalline and silicon products are now contributing the majority of our EES revenues and orders. Operating loss for EES increased slightly over Q2 despite higher revenue partly due to support in spending associated with the eight simultaneous SunFab lines that are in various phases of implementation. Quarterly results in this segment are also impacted by acquisition and related charges of approximately 25 to 30 million for PWS and (inaudible). We are pleased with the progress we’ve made to date with integrating these acquisitions and excluding acquisition charges both the businesses were profitable in the third quarter. We expect that operating and gross margins in our thin film business will be low in our initial SunFab projects due to learning curve related spending. We are simultaneously ramping multiple first of their kind plants in different locations around the world. Our priority is and will continue to be the success of our customers. We do expect to rapidly proliferate our early learnings, and we should see increasing profitability from this business in the second half of 2009. Applied Global Services. In Q3 despite a difficult industry environment and its four semiconductor service market our services business showed signs of resilience. While orders were down 10% and net sales were up slightly at 607 million. In the current environment while customers are tightly controlling spending on spares, we are seeing increasing demand for our service capability including in under penetrated markets in Asia. Operating income was slightly lower than Q2 due to an unfavorable product mix in some one-time charges related to a legal settlement and related exit of the legends product line obtained in the Metron acquisition. In display orders remain high but were down 24% from last quarter. As Mike described the order cycle, which started in Q4 ’07 appears to have reached an inflection point in Q3 ’08, and we expect the down swing in orders to be as significant as the up swing ones. Display achieved record revenue with net sales of 311 million, an increase of 57% from Q2 and included recognition of the first pivot PVD tool from a leading customer. Display also generated record operating profit of 103 million or 33% of net sales resulting from the increase in revenue and favorable product mix partially offset by higher spending. In Q3 we made further progress ramping our Taiwan facility, and we’re shipping more than one third of our display systems from Taiwan. Next I would like to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow performance. We ended the quarter with a cash and investment balance of 3.72 billion, a decrease of 124 million. Cash flow performance was good as we generated 320 million in cash from operations or 17% of revenue. Working capital performance for the quarter benefited from solid receivables performance and inventory increases of approximately 227 million were driven by display in solar. Customer deposits associated with our SunFab and other EES contracts substantially offset our increased inventory requirements. In Q3 Applied returned 381 million or 119% of operating cash flow to its stockholders. Of this amount 300 million was for the repurchase of 15.6 million shares at an average price of $19.22 and 81 million was for cash dividends. We expect to spend between 200 million and 400 million on share repurchases in our fiscal Q4. Before I outline our Q4 target, I would like to reiterate some of the key market issues that are impacting our outlook for the coming quarter. First, semiconductor capital equipment demand is expect to do remain flat and any revenue increase over the prior quarter appears to be modest. We do expect orders to strengthen somewhat based on customer forecasts. Flat panel display shipment demand will remain strong as customers add capacity although the order cycle is expected to decline sharply in Q4. We expect further progress integrating our crystalline silicon solar businesses which will bring revenue rates closer in line with shipment rates. We also expect services markets will be relatively flat with movement around last quarter’s level being a function of demand for spares and used equipment from our semiconductor customers. Now let me provide our Q4 targets. We expect orders to be up in the range of 5 to 10% overall with increased DES and silicon orders partially offset by a sharp decline of about 75% in display. We expect revenue to be up in the range of 2% to 10% overall driven by revenue from crystalline silicon and thin film solar products. As we previously forecasted, we expect to recognize our first SunFab revenue in Q4 ’08. We expect EPS to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.15 per share, up in line with revenue overall. Operating margin will continue to be impacted somewhat by our investment in the solar build out and our investment in SSG R&D to position our silicon products during the downturn. We believe there will be substantial upside in our earnings over time as silicon recovers and we see increased profitability in solar. With that, Robert, let’s open the call for questions.
Robert Friess - Vice President and Treasurer: Thanks, George. As a reminder please limit your question to say one per firm and one follow-up. Kara, let’s begin with the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jay Dana with JP Morgan.
Jay Dana:  Okay. Can you hear me?
Michael R. Splinter: We can, hi, Jay.
Jay Dana: Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Two questions. The first one is in the May conference call I believe if I remember correctly you stated that your customers would demonstrate working single junction panels by the end of the July quarter and tandem junction panels by the end of the October quarter. We got the first part of that done. Just wondering if the second part of that is on track and sort of in line with that, you made a statement about a release from the European patent office in your prepared remarks. Wondering if you can expand on that a little bit and indicate what that means in relative to the lawsuit against Sun film? Thank you.
Michael R. Splinter: Sure, thanks Jay. I am going to have to say this in a way, but you’ll have to ask our tandem junction customers specifically about the progress, but we feel our technologies online and we’re quite excited about the progress we made there this quarter, I would say definitely on track to your definition. On the patent we’re really as I said quite happy with the progress we made on tandem junction. I think this provisional, and it is a provisional opinion from the European patent office confirms our view that the patented is not valid and in addition of course as we stated publicly, we believe our unique and proprietary structure does not infringe that patent in the first place.
Jay Dana: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krishna Shankar with Banc of America Securities. Mr. Shankar your line is open.
George S. Davis: Krishna, can you hear us?
Krishna Shankar: Hello?
George S. Davis: Yes, hi. Now we can hear you.
Krishna Shankar: Okay, how are you George. A couple of questions, one, I wanted to follow-up. Did I miss something when you said what are the ease operating margin excluding the one time charges for acquisition and are you still besides that are you still focused that the overall photo business will be break even in ’09 or any upside to that?
George S. Davis: On your first question, Krishna, the M&A charges are running about 30 million a quarter in EES, so you can adjust that for the ongoing, and then in terms of break even we’re still saying that we believe it will be break even in 2009, and I don’t really want to update our guidance on that any further at this point, but we feel very good about what we can do to improve profitability there over time. We really expect the bulk of the learning curve that we’re going to experience is going to be over during really through the first half of ’09, we’ll have seen virtually everything you can see and in starting up one of these factories. All right. Next question.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin:  Thank you. Mike, I was wondering if you could elaborate more. I think you said on the silicon order guidance you expected silicon orders to grow about 30% sequentially. What’s giving you that confidence level? Is that mostly a few customer projects, product market share gains or what else can you share there and how sustainable do you think that looks like it will be about a billion dollars a quarter? How sustainable do you think silicon bookings could be past this October quarter? Thanks.
Michael R. Splinter:  Yeah. Thanks, Steven. What I said was that silicon orders would be up in the quarter greater than 30%. It pretty much is really focused on just a few customers increasing at this point, particularly in flash and DRAM still in this area, a little bit of foundry we expect to see some foundry order increase. I think the big question is how sustainable is that into Q1, and I think you know how cautious I am about this at this point, and I think it is just too early to forecast what Q1 is going to be like, but because I primarily think that depends on what the consumers are going to do in the second half of the year, and I really can’t predicted that at this point. If I thought the current trends would continue and inventories would continue down, I would be a lot more bullish than I currently am.
Stephen Chin: Great, thanks, Mike.
Michael R. Splinter: Next question.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer.
Gary Hsueh:  Just continuing the theme on your SSG order guidance for up above 30% quarter-on-quarter, my comment, from a bottom’s up perspective, exactly how much is that driven by your market share gains and how much of that just sort of an industry phenomena happening here in calendar Q4?
Michael R. Splinter: I think most of it is industry, Gary. I think that these are projects, but again it depends on spending pattern of certain customers. So, these are customers that we have very strong share with, so it gives us a little bit of accelerated benefit than maybe we normally have if it was other customers.
Gary Hsueh:  Okay. Just somewhat hesitant about that the trajectory, but you’re sort of walking a fine line in terms of coloring an inflection point off of a very low in the July quarter and moving up in the October quarter, doesn’t sound like you’re willing to put a stamp on your view for the January quarter, but what specifically or quantity take actively is your view for capital spending in ’09? You talked about capital intensity shifting back up over the next one or two years. Is it fair to say you expect capital pending in absolute terms up year-over-year in ’09?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes, I think it is fair to say I expect capital spending to be up year-over-year in ’09. As you know last time I said that I really felt our Q3 was the bottom of the trough, and that we would see a modest recovery. I am sticking to that at this time. I think all of those things are coming to be fact, but my big question, if we’re talking about calendar 2009 right now, my big question about 2009 is the first four months, what happens after the end of the year selling season, how well inventories are brought down and controlled, and I think if you look at overall utilization in the industry, it is very high, it is still increasing so there is not a lot of capacity out there, and if overall economies gets better, I think the second half of 2009 will be good. All that far is very qualitative. I just think too early for us to give any kind of quantitative estimate at this point.
Gary Hsueh: Okay. Last, question here for George. George, if you look at the EES numbers, the revenue numbers somewhere around $200 million in the October quarter and roughly $500 million in terms of orders, there is a pretty big gap between orders and revenue. How should we model basically revenue kind of trailing behind orders for EES and you mentioned in the second half better profitability. Is that surely by an increase or big increase in revenue or do you expect to start a tail off the amount of OpEx increase in EES in the second half of ’09? What’s really driving that profitability? Revenue? OpEx growth slowing or combo of both?
George S. Davis:  Let me deal with the orders question really from a backlog perspective because the backlog performance differently in the solar business than it does in the traditional semiconductor equipment business, so where as the orders are coming on, we’ll see them much more spread out over the year than the front loaded order conversion to revenue that used to seeing in the semiconductor space. So, I think that is probably the biggest difference there. In terms of improving profitability, I think we’ll come at it from two angles. I think there is a lot of spending that’s really bundled up in impacting gross margin that on these early projects where we’re working to integrate all of these tools coming together for the first time in the factory and making the adjustment that are necessary to get the production worthiness of these factories to where we both would like them to be, so that’s one track and we’re make ago lot of progress on that front, going through a lot of learning, but we’re very pleased with the progress there, and the other piece of course is the OpEx not only to support the start up of these factories but the initial installations on these things, so there is a lot going on that will -- that I think will become far more efficient over time and subsequent factories and so depending on the growth OpEx may actually increase over time, but the effectiveness and efficiency and the flow through to operating margin will be substantially better.
Gary Hsueh: Thank you
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs:  Good afternoon, guys thanks so much for taking the question. Question on the flat panel display segment. If I heard you right, I think you said real significant decline in orders, 75% and increase in shipments. I just wonder isn’t that a little in-consistent if customers are cutting orders because of excess capacity why do they need to take more shipments and therefore is there any risk to the shipment guidance or shipment push outs for flat panel display over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.
George S. Davis: Thanks, Jim. Our view is orders are going to be down substantially, and we didn’t say that revenue was going to be up quarter-over-quarter, but sort of flat plus or minus. It is not the big contributed, we said on the upside for the quarter for revenue would be EES, and that AGS and display and silicon all are kind of flat plus or minus around the mean. So, what you tend to see with the big order pullbacks and display is that the backlog holds up very well. You can see some stretching in the pattern of the revenue over time, but we don’t see any reason to think that we won’t have a similar pattern in this go round. We’re expecting strong revenue, but we’re not forecasting growth.
Michael R. Splinter: Jim, I just add into that, this is Mike, that these factories do take a long time to start up, and also those customers do make down payments on their machines, so they’re quite motivates, take those machines, work the bugs out of the factory, make sure it is running so that they can ramp up the factories as demand shows.
Jim Covello: Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.
Weston Twigg:  Just, going back to SunFab for a minute, one of your customers CIG net solar commented the majority of its customers want have their quarter size to remodels rather than the full size GEN8 modules. Seems, likes that takes away the value proposition which is to lower the total balance of systems costs by reducing the number of panels installed. I just wonder if you can give us your view on how long it might take to change the customer mindset to the idea of using the larger GEN8 panel and how much success you’re having there?
Michael R. Splinter: If you had the opportunity. Hi, Wes. If you had the opportunity to attend inter solar, you may have seen our installation video. So, people have to get used to installing the bigger panels. This will take a little bit of time. We’re working with those installers now so they understand the handling and how to do this, but there is no real technology here. So, as time has passed we’re seeing pretty dramatic increased interest in handling the full size panels. I think that will be a trend that we’ll see over the next year or so, but we also have thought about this from the very start to offer the flexibility to cut panels in one quarter one half size, but I think what we’ll see is mostly one quarter and they then full size panels as the handling techniques get more familiar to all the installers.
Weston Twigg:  Okay, great. Just, wondering if you can ask one more on the HCP side. I believe last quarter you mentioned that orders were tracking about 200 million. Is that consistent with this quarter and then also just wondering how the manufacturing capacity expansion is progressing in terms of total capacity for those two projects?
George S. Davis:  Sure, the capacity expansion is progressing very well and the rates in Q3 were some where to the – to that level that we did at the $200 million that we talked about in terms of shipments we expected actually to be up fairly substantially in Q4 on a shipment basis because of the primarily driven by increased --- actually pretty much driven by increases in both locations, so the naturally reflects in at the capacity additions and also just timings some shipments.
Weston Twigg:  Okay, thanks.
George S. Davis :  Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line if Tim Arcuri with Citigroup.
Tim Arcuri: Hi, guys couple of things. First of all, George, now that you’re pretty and fair into your solar business, can you give us some sort of update in terms of what the break even will be in the business? I think you talked about crossing over to profitability previously sometime in the first half of ‘09 sounds like that might be more like maybe mid-year to back half of ‘09 now and I’m wondering can you give us some kind of you know idea as to what the breakeven revenue level is, number one, and number two, I wanted to know when you think you are going to recognize the revenue on tandem junction?
George S. Davis: Well, number one, on the solar profitability as we said Cheney and PWS want to take out the M&A charges pretty much breakeven now and an ongoing in for better and we see they are improving overtime immediately. It is really the timing of when thin film makes the turn, and that will be a function of a couple things, one timing of revenue recognition and again how rapidly we’re able to basically proliferate the learning curves. Since we’re right in the middle of that, I am not ready to forecast that right now. I think the overall picture is as we said, and we still think the 2010 profitability outlook that we’ve discussed of 25% to 35% operating margins in this business overall is still very viable. So, we’ll continue to update and inform as we go along and we’re going to get every quarter we’re just going to be that much further along on the learning curve. Also, within EES we have the glass and web businesses, which are already profitable, albeit at lower margins than some of our established equipment businesses and then we have some R&D activities on kind of new generation opportunities that we’re looking at that also impact the overall operating performs.
Michael R. Splinter: George can you answer the question about tandem junction?
George S. Davis:  Sure, we are not going to forecast that. I have changed that. Thanks Tom.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho: Two questions, first George on the acquisition related charges of $41 million were they on the line item? And secondly, for I guess either you are Mike in terms of the silicon orders for the fourth quarter what type of linearity are you see -- are you seeing some of these orders coming in the month of October is that what’s giving you confidence versus some of your equipment peers? Thanks.
George S. Davis: So, on M&A you’ve got the 41 about 35 of it is in cost of sales and the balance is in OpEx. And in terms of within the segments the majority of it as I said is in the EES.
Michael R. Splinter: Hi, Patrick I think that the orders are pretty lumpy because there are few bigger orders and but I would not say that they are all in the last month of our quarter, not at all.
Patrick Ho:  Great, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar: Hi, Question on margins. I guess if I look into the October quarter your guiding revenue is that despite the 30% growth in silicon which is high margin, sounds like flat panel is flat. What’s the mix factor driving EPS slightly lower at the mid-point?
George S. Davis: Yeah, I think the biggest impact is that most of the revenue increases we said is coming out of EES, and so you have less flow through to profitability at this time. So, the way I would describe Q4 is we’re still in the investment phase for solar. We expect silicon to stay at low levels similar to where we were in Q3. So, we’re keeping strong cost controls in place and quite frankly our established businesses are all performing very well given their respective cycles. So, that’s I think really to see the upside which we expect to be quite considerable in EPS we are going to have see SSG recover and then flow through profitability in solar.
Satya Kumar: Okay. And a follow up question on orders you are guiding up 5 to 10% you sort of talked about silicon and display and if I think fab solutions and somewhere in between the last couple of quarters for orders, I get about $100 million increase for the adjacent groups is that about right? And could you give a little more granularity in terms of what the contribution might be from the SunFab portion and the non-SunFab portion for bookings in October?
George S. Davis: Yeah, I am not going to give you that detail of breakout, but let me characterize overall what we see the moving pieces are for the coming quarter. So, we’ve said we think it will be a 5% to 10% AGS is flattish generally around this quarter display we said it’s going to be down 75% or so. So really all of the orders uptick is coming from silicon and EES. Mike said silicon is going to be greater than 30% up on orders, so then the rest really is coming out of EES. We have talked about Cheeny and PWS contributing the majority of the orders, and we see that continuing.
Satya Kumar:  Thanks.
George S. Davis:  You are welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray.
Jesse Pichel: Yes Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my call. Mr. Sprinter, you mentioned 120-micron wafers in your prepared remarks. Does that represent a new wire saw or is that simply qualifying a new process on existing equipment and to that end, is AMAT developing new device structures for crystalline solar cells?
Michael R. Splinter:  Okay. So, first of all let’s sit on the 120-micron we are developing new products for 120-micron capability and are working with customers on those today. Our machines are now capable across the board to all of our products from saws to deposition to metallization to testing etcetera. So, I think that’s kind of explains where we are there. Part of our strength is to be able to keep the technology rolling and keep it moving fast, and that’s the idea we want to bring to not these acquisitions so that we really stay ahead in this field. And then on developing device structures, we’re certainly interested in supporting customers in that area. But at this point that’s what we’re doing we’re working with various customers on improving different sales structures but are doing independent work in that area at this point.
Jesse Pichel: Do you anticipate new AMAT offerings for the crystalline silicon solar cell equipment near term?
Michael R. Splinter:  Yes.
Jesse Pichel: Thank you, very much.
Michael R. Splinter: Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with FBR.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. Going back to the SunFab, I want to get an update on the certification process. Back in the silicon west I think Mark was talking about certification starting towards October timeframe, and could you give us an update and would it be fair to assume that as this lines are certified at the customers site we would see an acceleration in those efforts and would that help with a faster than expected revenue recognition?
George S. Davis: Well, okay. First of all, certification is on track, no change from what Mark talked about a few weeks ago both tandem junction and single junction are in the certification loop, and I think before the end of the year on single junction shortly after the end of the year on tandem junction after once we have those certifications done, then customers just have to demonstrate that their panels are equivalent to that certification. So, that takes substantially less time, but right now I think customers are having no problem getting contracts for buying their panels. Demand is significantly higher than supply at the current time. That might change next year or the year after, but right now customers are able to find people to take their, to sign off, take the agreements that are completely selling out their factory.
Mehdi Hosseini: My follow-up question is there any relationship between certification and revenue recognition and then of all your customers how many have come back with a significant second set of orders?
George S. Davis: I will let Mike -- let me first address the revenue recognition question, and then Mike will come back on the customer profile. So, in terms of revenue recognition, each of our contracts is slightly different for what constitutes customer acceptance. Some of the contracts have some form of certification anticipated as part of the sign off, and some do not, so it varies by customer. So, it’s one factor, I wouldn’t say it is necessarily a gating or deciding factor for our contracts.
Michael R. Splinter: Mehdi, we’ve had two customers come back for follow-on orders at the current time.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Michael R. Splinter:  Next question?
Operator: Alright, I do apologize. Your next question comes from CJ Muse with Lehman Brothers.
CJ Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. When you look out over the next four quarters for EES, what do you think the mix will look like between crystal and silicon and thin film?
George S. Davis: Well, certainly thin film is going to start to close the gap, and again for the next few quarters for sure the crystalline silicon will be well ahead of the thin film.
CJ Muse: Okay. When do you think that will surpass that level?
George S. Davis: In sometime in 2007, but it’s not, I don’t have a point in time estimate for you.
CJ Muse: Okay. And then I guess on the operating margin side for the service business, looks like it is tracking a little bit lower. lower. Can you help I guess help me understand what’s going on there? Is that display in solar entering the mix at lower margins or is it something else that worked there?
George S. Davis: No, as I said in my prepared remarks, there was some settlement activities and other items. If you look at the ongoing operating margin for them, it is right in line with history. So, that was more of a one-time item. So, it will be if they came in at 26% on an ongoing basis.
CJ Muse:  Great, thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of [Mattis Malic] with Morgan Stanley.
Mattis Malic:  My questions, George, nice job on the gross margins for SSG business. The gross margins appear better than your peers like [Lambry] and Novell less. Where do you think you can take the gross margins once the revenues come back?
George S. Davis: It is interesting. What we tried to do is increase the variability and improve the cycle time over time and it is really I just applaud you’re seeing over time a lot of the great work our team in Austin has done reducing their cycle times and we’re much more in-variable in that sense, so we do expect it to -- we do expect to have some leverage obviously as revenue comes up, but what you’re really seeing is we have tremendous ability to ride down a difficult environment and still preserve very attractive profitability overall. It is one of the reasons why we’re able to continue to fund R&D at a high level and still basically preserve our overall business model as a company.
Mattis Malic: Got it. And, then one follow-up for Mike. Mike, you spoke about credit tightening in the markets and I can see memory makers getting impacted from it, but can you talk about credit tightening in your solar customers? Are you seeing any signs there or baking any worst case scenarios in your models?
Michael R. Splinter: We haven’t seen anybody that can’t get money at this point, but I would say the hurdles to get it have gone up dramatically. The, amount of information, the detail at which the lending or financing institutions are looking at the various projects are much more severe than they were six months ago, but I think fundamentally they still believe it is a great place to invest and there is money to be made.
Mattis Malic:  Thank you.
Robert Friess - Vice President and Treasurer: We’ll take one more question and then move to final remarks.
Operator:  Your final question will come from Edwin Locke of Needham & Company.
Edwin Locke:  I didn’t mean to squeeze in. A question on the solar side. You mentioned you have eight lines in start upright now but some of what you reported in loss you only booked six line. How do you reconcile the difference there and does it mean you can book these lines or what happened there?
George S. Davis: No. What we said is when we believe when we’re within one year of sign off that we’ll go ahead and book the order and so we’ve gone ahead and that’s been the basis and we’ll continue to be the basis at this time.
Edwin Locke:  I see. Great. And, then my follow-up is on display side. You mentioned that it appears that the current GEN8 cycle is investment is largely over. How do we visualize this cycle? Do we expect a down cycle or very low booking level for the next few quarters and look at loss cycle looks like lost like four or five quarters. Should I look at it that way or how do you visualize that?
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. I think you should largely visualize it in that way. I don’t know about five quarters, but we think that in the second half of next year we’re going to start to see increased orders for the GEN 10 build out and along the way here of course some of the smaller suppliers will invest in increased capacity in GEN 8.5, but I think this is kind of the trend in the display business, very big cycles of ordering, pretty smooth acceptance of equipment, and started up of those factories. Meanwhile a big drop off until the next generation is ready. I would say that one of the things that in talking with customers is that, they are all very clear about moving to Gen10. So, I don’t think any question in our mind now about the viability of a Gen10 or a Gen12 for that matter in the display business. So, the cycle continues here, everybody believes this will continue to drive costs out, and the market, the TV market continues to move to bigger and bigger LCD panels and I just think it is a matter of time until LCD is basically 100% of the TV market.
Edwin Locke: Great, thanks.
Robert Friess - Vice President and Treasurer: We would like to thank you for joining us in our discussion of Applied Materials financial results. We would like to remind you that a replay of this call and supporting slide package will be available on our website starting at 5 pm today and will remain posted until August 26. Thank you, again for your interest in Applied Materials.
Operator: That concludes this evening’s teleconference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Applied Materials’ fiscal 2008 second quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards you will be invited to participate in the question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 13th, 2008. I would now like to turn the conference over to Linda Heller, Vice President of Investor Relations, Applied Materials. Please go ahead.
Linda Heller: Thank you, Kara (sp). Good afternoon and welcome to Applied Materials’ fiscal 2008 second quarter earnings call. I’m happy to be participating in my first quarterly call here at Applied. For those of you whom I’ve not yet met, I’m looking forward to speaking with you soon.  Before we begin let me remind you that we will be hosting our traditional analyst briefing at this year’s SEMICON West show on Tuesday morning, July 15th. This year’s event will be focused specifically on the Silicon Systems Group. More details on this will be coming to you soon. Joining me on the call today are Mike Splinter, President and CEO; George Davis, Chief Financial Officer; and Joe Sweeney, Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary. Today we will discuss our results for the period ending April 27th, 2008. The financial results were released this afternoon at 1:05 p.m. Pacific Time. A copy of the news release is available on Business Wire and on our website, www.appliedmaterials.com. Today’s earnings call contains forward-looking statements including those relating to Applied’s performance, products, growth opportunities, strategic positions, displays in solar momentum, operational efficiencies, cash generation and deployment, and financial targets, customer spending and the outlook for the semi-conductor display and solar industry. All forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in today’s earnings press release and in the company’s filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 13th, 2008, and the company assumes no obligation to update such statements. Mike Splinter will lead off the call with highlights on the current industry environment and company progress. George will follow with a discussion on our financial performance for the second quarter and our targets for the third fiscal quarter of 2008. After George and Mike’s remarks we will open the call for questions. With that I would like to turn the call over to Mike.
Michael R. Splinter: Thank you, Linda. I’d like to take a moment to welcome Linda Heller as Vice President of Investor Relations. Linda joined Applied the day before our annual meeting in March and she has been getting acquainted with many of you since that time. She’s already a great addition to our team. As we report on the second quarter, Applied Materials is growing in our display and solar businesses and managing effectively through the current wafer fab equipment downturn. The overall business environment is clearly marked by a shifting global economy with uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Based on recent conversations with customers, we expect to see a further slowdown in semiconductor capital expenditures. We now anticipate wafer fab equipment spending to be down 25% to 35% in calendar 2008, down considerably from our earlier view that called for a second half recovery lead by Foundry and Flash. Our current view is more negative than what you might derive solely from spending cuts announced during this past quarter. Within the key markets for semiconductors in calendar 2008 we see DRAM investment down 50%, NAND Flash down more than 15%, and finally in logic both slowing by more than 20%.  So the real questions on everyone’s mind are: Is this the bottom? What will drive our recovery? And of course, when will it happen? I see a number of factors.  First, yes, we think this is the bottom. However, to return to growth we must see sustained increases in DRAM unit prices that translate into improved profitability and cash flow. While average DRAM contract prices increased more than 15% in the last 30 days it’s still well below levels necessary to support meaningful investment. In addition, these difficult market conditions have produced plans for industry consolidation that could allow for a more rational future capacity growth. Supply and demand looks to be in better balance in the second half of the calendar year as demand outgrows bit supply led by growth in PCs and significant adoption of DDR-3. Second, we expect the next phase of capacity build out for NAND Flash to meet the growing demand for new applications. The most exciting application on the horizon is the adoption of solid state drives which offers significant value in power, space, and performance for PCs and Enterprise systems. Beginning in 2009 and over the next several years we expect NAND Flash manufacturing to ramp up to an incremental three to four million 12-inch wafers per year at the 4X nanometre generation to enable this market. Third, we’re closely monitoring Foundries to see when they’ll ram capacity for 65 nanometre and increase leading edge investment at 45 nanometres.  As I said at the beginning of this year, this is a year of execution for Applied Materials and that’s where we are focusing our attention.  Our silicon management is navigating through a very rough cycle while driving new product introductions and substantially improving operating efficiency. We have recently announced the Applied Aera2 for mask inspection, Tetra for mask clean, and the Inflexion for bevel polish. We’re pleased with the early customer reaction, in particular our mask inspection system is already running production at multiple customers. Together these three products provide more than a half a billion dollars in new market opportunity. Two-thousand-and-seven was not a great year for our CMP product line. Our served available market declined due to substantial productivity improvements delivered by our systems and we failed to capture the business at a major Flash manufacturer. Today improvements in our Reflexion CMP products are being recognized by key customers as we minimize the effects and deliver high productivity. We continue to pursue long-term opportunities in etch and inspection. In 2007 overall etch share, as well as our share in inspection, was essentially flat. We expect that etch share will be lower in 2008, impacted by the reduction of spending by memory companies where we hold a majority of our positions. In 2008 we expect gains in inspections through the further adoption of U-vision and Aera2 as the defects related to immersion lithography become even more difficult to detect. We have improved our position with Flash customers in order to be ready for the future capacity build out. We shipped our 200th producer for advanced patterning films, which is used in nearly all advanced memory fabs for as many as 10 lithographic layers. In solar our team is focused on multiple, simultaneous sun fab start ups and growing our equipment business with crystal and silicon customers. This is an exciting time as we move through the launch phase of a global business that is changing the dynamics of solar energy. We are facing the challenges of the start up of multiple factories simultaneously and performing critical R&D to boost cell efficiency and reduce costs. At the same time, we are using the power of Applied Materials to deploy nearly 500 people in the field, putting the right expertise in the right place to help customers succeed with fast ramps of their factories.  Our thin film sun fab offering has strong market momentum, as evidenced by the disclosure in March of our first contract for a gigawatt scale project. Solar customers understand the cost benefits that come with the combination of technology and scale. Sun fab 5.7 square metre solar panels are expected to start rolling off production lines by mid-year. There are currently four factories in start-up mode, two of them are already depositing silicon on glass. Soon we will have eight lines in start-up. Our internal manufacturing and supply chain is executing on schedule for each of our customers’ factories and is ramping on pace with growth.  We’ve made great progress over the quarter with improved efficiency and uniformity of both the single and tandem junction films. We are getting excellent results on tests and have established a reliability lab in Sheon (sp). We are pleased to announce today that Sun Film awarded Applied a contract for a second tandem junction sun fab line. While our sun fab product has captured a lot of attention, I want to also highlight the significant business that we have established in crystalline silicon equipment. We are now providing equipment for the highest value-added steps of the crystalline silicon process flow, from wafering to anti-reflective coating and metallization, to test and sort. In fact, our ATON PVD is the tool of choice for lines with capacity greater than 50 megawatts and is shipping at record rates.  In precision wafer systems integration is on track and as of the close of Q2 we had increased manufacturing capacity about 90% since the acquisition in June 2007.  Our Baccini team had a record quarter for shipments as our capacity improvements started to catch up to demand. The market acceptance for solar PV is growing. The costs of photovoltaic solar electricity at $0.15 to $0.25 per kilowatt hour has already reached good parity with the peak rates of several important markets, including California. And as our 5.7 square metre sun fab panels start to move to the field in volume by year end we’ll begin to see the installation advantages of these larger panels and expect a 15% to 20% decrease in install costs. Our service team is growing its capabilities for solar and display customers while maintaining strong financial performance. AGS continues to perform well despite the difficult conditions related to semiconductor equipment. Revenue is up modestly year over year, largely from the impact of new business areas. AGS is making good progress in the down turn, capturing six new silicon service penetrations this quarter with three of them in Taiwan.  Despite the closing of some 200 millimetre memory fabs, we see 200 millimetres as an area of strength for the next six months for both after-market upgrades and refurbished tools. In addition, we recently introduced our sun fab performance service program and just announced a multi-year agreement with T-solar in Spain.  Our display team is meeting the demands of an unprecedented ramp. Orders in the first six months of the fiscal year have already topped our full-year record achievement in 2006. Q2 orders stayed strong after the record quarter in Q1. Industry capital spending is estimated to be up more than 50% in calendar 2008. And we expect our revenue to be up roughly the same percentage in our fiscal year and continuing to ramp into 2009. The PiVot PVD system is gaining acceptance as customers are seeing a significant improvement in up time, in cost of ownership due to improved target utilization. PVD almost doubles our available market and should provide growth opportunities as we move to the GEN10 size systems.  Overall, Applied is executing well in a very dynamic environment. In silicon we are substantially improving our operating model while maintaining our commitment to invest in R&D, shifting the targets of some programs and reprioritizing others, and ensuring that we fuel innovation. In solar and display we are in a period of rapid growth and experiencing the inherent execution challenges that come with it. We are focused on our cost structure and will continue to keep costs in line with our business model.  Our employees have shown considerable dedication and resolve to get results in our different businesses and flexibility to meet the demands of changing conditions. Discipline and execution are critical to capitalizing on this environment and I’m pleased with how our teams have performed to date. Now I’ll turn the call over to George to comment on the company’s results for Q2 and to provide our targets for Q3. George?
George S. Davis: Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone. As Mike noted, we met our Q2 targets while managing the challenge of multiple businesses that are facing very different market conditions. Steep ramps in solar and display are in sharp contrast with the challenging conditions for silicon equipment.  Our services business continued to show solid performance during the period. Given the leverage of our silicon segment to overall performance, we have taken both short-term and long-term cost reduction actions. We are taking additional measures in the third quarter, including shut-down time and those businesses affected by lower demand, discretionary spending reductions, and executive pay cuts. Now we’ll summarize our second quarter performance. Q2 orders totalled $2.4 billion, a 3% reduction from Q1, and we’re at the low end of our target. The lower orders were primarily due to a decrease in display orders from the record levels achieved in Q1.  Backlog for Q2 increased to $4.6 billion. Backlog adjustments for the quarter were positive at $210 million comprised of additions of $367 million in beginning backlog from the Baccini acquisition and $80 million in currency adjustments offset by $238 million of de-bookings primarily for silicon equipment. Our backlog is at the highest level it has been in many years as the impact of the ramp in display and the growth of our solar bookings have more than offset the drop in silicon orders. As a result, we currently have backlog that is relatively evenly distributed across the segments.  Revenue for the quarter increased 3% to $2.1 billion and was within our target range, reflecting higher display and silicon sales partially offset by lower EEF sales, which I will discuss shortly. Gross margin for Q2 increased modestly to 45% from 44.8% in Q1 reflecting slightly higher revenue levels. Second quarter operating expenses were $529 million and reflect savings from the cost-reduction plan we announced in January partially offset by increased investment for our ramp in solar and display. Operating income increased to $438 million or 20% in revenue compared to 18% reported for the first quarter. The increase reflected higher revenue, the absence of restructuring costs, and the operating expense improvements I just mentioned.  Net income was $303 million or $0.22 per share meeting the high end of our target range.  Let`s now look at second quarter results by segment. In silicon orders were down slightly, as expected. Our order composition was DRAM 40%, foundries 22%, Flash memory 13%, logic and other 25%. Orders for 70 nanometre and below technology represented 94% of silicon orders. Q2 silicon net sales were up 2% compared to the prior quarter as increased demand from foundry customers offset weakness in DRAM and logic spending. Operating income was $448 million or 35% of net sales. Our performance clearly shows the benefits of the many actions taken to improve the operational and financial performance. The silicon management team has done an excellent job over the last three quarters of capturing the benefits both operationally and commercially from the formation of a single silicon organization. These actions include: one, prioritization of R&D resources to the most critical projects and portfolio management leading to exit of unprofitable businesses and projects; two, improved cycle times in our manufacturing lines and continuous push to lower material costs through global sourcing and various supply chain initiatives; and three, headcount reductions to increase synergies and eliminate redundancies while flexing our temporary work force and discretionary spending to absorb volatility. To put the impact of these actions in context this quarter`s operating profit is eight percentage points higher than Q1 2006 when revenue was at similar levels. We are continuing to invest in long-term margin improvement through our global sourcing activities and made further progress in Q2 on our strategy to reduce costs and move certain manufacturing and procurement functions off shore. During the quarter we set plans in place for an Asian based merchant transit and manufacturing site in Singapore.  Orders in energy and environmental solutions totalled $257 million for the second quarter, down slightly from Q1 due to the lower orders from PWS. Q2 orders included $152 million for our Applied sun fab thin film lines and a modest amount from the first month of Baccini results.  Net sales of $85 million were down $37 million due to lower sales quarter over quarter in solar and glass products. Q2 sales do not yet include amounts for Baccini. We will report our first full quarter of revenue for Baccini in Q3. Our combined crystal and silicon solar products are now on an estimated shipment run rate of approximately $200 million per quarter. The operating loss for EDS of $71 million increased from Q1 reflecting the lower revenues and increased operating cost associated with the build out of our solar business, including multiple, simultaneous start ups and certain acquisition related charges for Baccini. In our services business Q2 orders were down 1% from Q1 due primarily to lower orders for spares in line with semiconductor industry conditions. Net sales increased 1% from Q1 due to higher display service sales offset by lower sales of refurbished equipment in (inaudible) software.  Operating income was $159 million or 26% of sales, a slight increase from Q1 due to improved margins and product maintenance.  As a reminder, in Q1 2008 we now, as of Q1 2008, we now reflect service results for display in solar under AGS. A segment level reconciliation of this change is available on our website.  In display orders in Q2 remained high, but were down 11% from the record level achieved last quarter. Still Q2 ranks as the second best ordered quarter ever at $493 million. LCD customer investment (inaudible) demand remains high remains high. In just two quarters this year display has already exceeded its previous annual record for equipment orders of $883 million that was achieved in fiscal year 2006. Display net sales of $198 million for Q2 reflected the increased level of order activity that began in the latter part of fiscal year 2007. Display operating income increased to $59 million or 30% of net sales due to higher revenue and product mix partially offset by higher cost. Display is ramping PECVD equipment manufacturing capability to supply both the display and solar requirements with new capacity in our Tainon facility. This facility will enable the manufacturing organization to support ramp requirements of these two businesses and leverage our primarily Taiwan-based supply chain. We expect to continue with a healthy outsource model even as we more than triple our production of CVD and PVD tools. Next I would like to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We entered the quarter with a cash and investment balance of $3.85 billion and increases of $484 million. Cash flow performance was very strong this quarter as we generated $874 million in cash flow operations with 41% of revenue.  Working capital performance for the quarter reflected strong receivables and collections performance partially offset by inventory build of approximately $200 million in solar related businesses.  We are taking a prudent approach to managing our working capital requirements at solar. Our sun fab contracts typically require cash payments and letters of credit that must be coincided with the timing and magnitude of working capital investments.  In Q2 Applied returned $381 million or 44% of operating cash flow to its stockholders. Of this amount, $300 million was for the repurchase of 15 million shares at an average price of $19.97 and $81 million was for cash dividends. Two-hundred-and-sixty million in cash was generated from the exercise of 14 million stock options. We expect to spend between $200 million and $400 million on share repurchases in Q3 2008. Before I give our Q3 targets I want to recap three major things. One, our business groups are performing well, showing strong financial and operational results while executing very different growth opportunities. Two, we are seeing a steep decline in SSG indicating a cyclical bottom in our fiscal Q3 and we`ll continue to manage both cost and while fully funding R&D. Three, we continue to benefit from a strong ramp in display and solar and we are pleased with the progress of our sun fab lines and have seen the first repeat orders from our early customers. Now I`d like to move on to our guidance. Our targets for Q3 are: We expect orders to be down in the range of 15% to 25% driven by a very weak quarter for silicon equipment and lower display orders coming off back-to-back record orders for display.  We expect revenue to be down in the range of 10% to 18% due to a decrease in silicon partially offset by increases in our other segments. We see a strong pullback by both Flash and DRAM memory customers in our third quarter. We believe this near term caution by our customers will impact silicon equipment sales by more than 40% versus Q2. We expect EPS to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.14 per share reflecting lower revenue, the mixed impact of reduced silicon business, growth in spending in solar and display partially offset by continuing focus on our cost initiatives.  With that, Linda, let`s open the call for questions.
Linda Heller: Kara, please begin with the first question.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer and Company.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of controversy here over cost per watt and the models that you enable with your customers. I keep talking relative terms about cost per watt for the industry and benefits of installation costs for the 0.5G sort of format. Could you give us some idea on single junction and tandem junction technologies to aim at and what’s your assessment of cost per watt to your customers in terms of their manufacturing model. And number two, what are some of the big levers in terms of reducing cost per watt for your customers over the next two or three years?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure, Gary. Thanks. Okay. So, I think what we’ll see over, first of all, what I think we’ll see over a period of time is a pretty strong trend to tandem junction. Even those customers that currently have single junction will see upgrades over a period of time to tandem. We’re already, in fact, seeing that, so the big focus is how fast will tandem junction costs come down. We have a target to improve efficiency over the next few years to 10% or more. We have a target to get to the cost per watt produced of (inaudible) and a standard sun fab line we think the big lines, gigawatt scale lines we’ll see another significant reduction because of the capital efficiency there. It is not quite quantified that you can expect it to be kind of in the 15% to 25% range of cost improvements. One of the, so as you know, we’re just starting up factories, so these numbers are all projections. One of the good things that we believe we’ll see across our factory network is very fast line as multiple factories, many engineers around the world, start to run these factories in production. So we’re already encouraged by what we’re seeing and the companies that are starting up their factories now and driving fast start up and improved operations. That’s kind of where we are and for right now I think the big thing for us is to get these factories into production and really start learning at a very fast rate.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, Mike. What about the levers, I mean, beyond efficiencies. (Inaudible) assume uptime and availability enabled by your kind of service division is another big lever in reducing cost per watt. Can you give me a sense of what percentage or relative reduction we can see with the increasing availability and up time as you (inaudible) learning curve?
Michael R. Splinter: Sure. I’m not sure I can give you all the kind of data that you want probably. We’d have to go through the spreadsheet. There are all kinds of things. Gas usage. Up time. Panel yield. Obviously efficiency productivity of our systems. Basically the speed of deposition, we’re working very hard to improve the speed of deposition. The microcrystalline layer is quite thick, so improving that speed is critically important to the cost. Electricity use of the machines. One of the things that we’ve done to work with customers, and it’s a hallmark of how our service agreement is structured, is that if the cost per watt goes down we win, we essentially get paid more in the service agreement if the cost per watt goes down for our customers. So this really aligns our motivations with the motivations of the customers. They win, we win, and hopefully the market wins.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin – UBS: Thank you. Mike, this is about the guidance. You’ve admitted that you believe (inaudible) will be down I think you said 40% (inaudible) it appears that silicon is approaching from the levels seen back in 2005 and maybe even 2002. Mike, when do you think the company will see a recovery stemming from equipment orders? Do you expect orders in October to still see some sort of recovery in silicon.
Michael R. Splinter: We do. I would say that we’re seeing levels that are kind of like 2003 levels. But anyway, yes, this is, these are, this quarter is especially soft. We think there will be improvement in the next quarter and into the first quarter of our first fiscal quarter of 2009, but again I think we have to see a return to profitability by memory companies for them to have real confidence to invest and also have the wherewithal to acquire the kind of money that major fab requires.
Stephen Chin – UBS: Okay. If I can just follow up on a question on the solar. Are any of these solar equipment orders being recognized in the July quarter from the large gigawatt customer that was announced in early March? If now, when can we expect orders to be signed off for that very large project?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, we’re not going to guide by specific customer. The orders that we booked for this quarter were for the contracts that we announced last year. 
Stephen Chin – UBS: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: Hi. Yeah, I just had a couple of questions here. One, jumping over to the semiconductor equipment side radical inspection. I’m wondering how many tools do you ship so far and how many of those have gone to fabs and how many to mask shops?
Michael R. Splinter: Almost all have gone to mask shops at this point. We’d just be starting to ship tools to fabs. We have four customers at the current time. 
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Great. And also just wondering, how big do you think that market is and how much of that market do you think AMAT can get by the end of 2009?
Michael R. Splinter: Well, we think it’s over $300 million to $400 million. I’m not going to make an estimate of how fast this product will ramp. I think we really have to get through this initial phase. But we like our machine for both in fab as well as radical inspection and mask shops. So I think the focus of our efforts here right now are going to be on really advanced mask where people are especially defect sensitive and have to figure out what’s going to print on the wafer before they either ship it to fabs or ship it to a scanner.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Great. And I just had a question jumping back over to the solar side. I just wanted a clarification. Did you say your target is a dollar wide in standard thin film lines and that you might get a 15% to 25% improvement over that at a larger scale?
Michael R. Splinter: That’s what I said, yes.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Deahna with J. P. Morgan.
Jay Deahna – J. P. Morgan: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. A couple of questions here. The first one I believe would be for George. George, when do you expect to shift your revenue recognition policy for sun fab tools to shipment based in line with the rest of the company from acceptance based now?  And the second question I believe for Mike. Can you give us a little more detail about the progress of your first set of customers and some of the challenges and optimism in terms of getting working single-junction panels for mid-year and when you would expect the first working tandem-junction panels. And then last, but not least, when you’re calling the bottom in 3Q is that an order and a shipment/revenue bottom for semi equipment? Thank you.
George S. Davis: Okay. Why don’t I take the first and the third. Hi, Jay. On the shipments based question for our solar fabs I think it’s early days on that. It’s a little different than our standard because we’re basically selling a full line as opposed to a single piece of equipment. Today we’re signing off based on customer acceptance. After we get through the first few fabs then we’ll take a look at what makes the most sense. But it’s different than our existing business so we’ll be looking at everything from sign off on shipment to percentage of completion, things along those lines. And then –
Jay Deahna – J. P. Morgan: Just a quick follow up on that one before you answer the other two.
George S. Davis: Sure.
Jay Deahna – J. P. Morgan: If you sell, if you ship roughly two 60-watt tandem-junction lines per month in calendar 2009 I estimate that’s roughly $2.5 billion in revenue. Now, if that’s recognized on shipment versus acceptance that could have a huge difference in the expectations for revenue and earnings for solar in calendar 2009. So to put it a little bit differently, do you think by the time we get into calendar 2009 it will be a little bit more in line with the normal company revenue recognition policy?
George S. Davis: I really go back to what I said before, Jay. I think it’s really too early to make that call. But we’re certainly focused on that and our real attention now is on getting these initial lines up and running and performing to our customer commitments. 
Jay Deahna – J. P. Morgan: Okay. Then the other two, please. 
George S. Davis: You want me to jump into the bottom? I’ll take your third question which is do we see Q3 as a bottom in revenue and orders. It’s clearly a bottom in revenue. Orders are down. We’re seeing orders down fairly substantially as well for silicon. Whether, you know, they both look like a bottom, but revenue clearly.
Michael R. Splinter: Hey, Jay. It’s Mike. On the progress on single junction, as I mentioned, we’re seeing two factories, two customers already depositing silicon. That’s a great sign as it’s the most critical element in making the cells. We just have a great set of people distributed around the world at every one of our customers’ factories. These are experienced people with experience in installing semiconductor equipment or display equipment. So we haven’t had, you know, trained these guys, these people from the beginning, but they have factory experience, they know how factories are supposed to run. So that gives me a lot of confidence we’re going to be able to get the equipment up, get it running, test out the cells and really see output over the next few months. And then on the tandem shipping, obviously going to be later in the year. We expect to see output before the end of the fiscal year.
Jay Deahna – J. P. Morgan: Before the end of the fiscal year?
Michael R. Splinter: M-hm.
Jay Deahna – J. P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: My question, George, I don’t know if you’re trying to quantify the silicon orders in the July quarter. Should I think of (inaudible) approaching at about one in the quarter?
George S. Davis: Yeah, I think it’s a little volatile to be that specific, but it’s coming down in line with the revenue drop off.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: What’s sort of driving that decline? When I look at your other US equipment peers they’re sort of having a big (inaudible) decline of 40%. For (inaudible) materials it’s a lot higher, down 60%. What is driving that underperformance in silicon for you relative to other (inaudible) companies?
Michael R. Splinter: I think you’re going to have, I’m not going to talk about other companies, but I have to talk about what we’ve seen in the last several weeks. I think the big shift is change in our view about what’s happening with Flash. We had expected Flash memory to have a pretty strong second half. In fact, that’s not going to happen. It’s going to be down 15% on the year. We see 50,000 wafers being pushed out. I think when others consider that, I’m not sure whether you saw Tokyo Electron’s announcement earlier today, but their view is pretty much in line with where ours is. So this is not just a, the big shift is Flash, but pretty much everybody is down. There’s only one company investing in foundries and they’re investing very incrementally at a pretty low level. DRAM we all know the story. And logic has been cautious. There’s not a good story in the total. We see 10 factories in total that have pushed out major, either pushed out or lowered their capacity goals for their factories. 
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Okay. That sounds good, Mike. If I could follow up on solar a little bit. One for Mike and one for George. When do you expect your customers to first ship GEN 8.5 panels from the get go and when do you expect that will happen with tandem.  And to George, there’s been some deterioration in the balance sheet metrics. The inventory levels are increasing to sort of the highest levels in five years and so are payables. How should we model that as we go forward as you ramp solar. And, also, if you could just remind us what your break even now is in solar and how the profitability will develop as you start recognizing solar revenues?
Michael R. Splinter: So to answer the first part of the question, we expect production panels in single junction coming off the line by mid-year, so we expect them to be selling in the second half of the year. In tandem junction we expect late in the year for panels to be coming off their lines so they’ll start selling production panels at the end of the year. 
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: In select full panels or are these cut panels from the GEN 8.5 cells? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, the cell is whatever customers demand. As you may know, our line allows for three sizes of panels: quarter size, half size, full size. As we get into production we’ll see more and more, as our customers get into production you’ll see more and more of the full size panels just because as the infrastructure develops they’ll be less costly to install. 
George S. Davis: Let me address, I’ll start with the balance sheet. Actually, I think we have a very good story on the balance sheet and in the way that we’re running our solar contracts. Virtually all of the solar contracts operate on the same basic principle of deposits and LCs to line up with the commitments that the company’s making. So the fact is that we are ramping very heavily and we do have to build revenue. I think what you’re seeing in the accounts payable and other liabilities line is really the growth of our deposits which are carried there on the balance sheet.  So I think that’s a good story for us. We haven’t had to draw down our cash balances to fund this ramp. We’ve probably had above expectation cash flow from operations this quarter because of the working capital discipline in our other businesses. So I think all in all we’re very comfortable with where that’s going and the approach that we’ve taken. In terms of the break even, I’ve said that we expected EDS to be break even in 2009 despite all of the build out going on this year. As revenue picks up in the second half of this year we think they closed the gap on that very quickly. So they’re performing as we expected despite very, very strong growth in spending to meet customer demand.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Citigroup.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Thanks. A couple things. First of all, if I take your silicon revenues down about 40% in the July quarter that’s down roughly 44% year over year. That’s like 2X what the average of kind of your other large peers are. So yet, if I look at your margins your margins are actually better than they’ve really ever been at this revenue level. I’m wondering, is there some element of you kind of selectively walking away from some business that just isn’t as profitable or is this kind of a customer mix issue? And particularly, how do the margins look coming out of this in the silicon business. And then I had a follow up question.
George S. Davis: Yeah. Okay. Do you want me to go?
Michael R. Splinter: I’ll start, you finish.
George S. Davis: Okay.
Michael R. Splinter: Okay. Hey, Tim, I think if you look at this lots of things are at play, of course. When are you that we exited some businesses and, as I commented, in certain areas we’ve been challenged by competitors. But those are very small percentages. We’re talking about major change in demand here. And major change in orders quarter over quarter. So I think this is what’s happening in the industry and others will update over a period of time.
George S. Davis: Yeah. I think also we should remember too that we report revenue on shipment and others on sign off. So we tend to be going down earlier on the down cycle. So that may be part of the factor in your math.  I will say that the decision to exit certain businesses and the portfolio realignment work that the semiconductor equipment team has done over the last year is having a real impact on the profitability and on the margins and, as we talked for a long time, the impact business was chronically unprofitable for us. So you’re seeing the impacts of that, the departure from the ECP business, as well as having a positive impact. But really it’s also about cycle time reductions that we’ve gotten in the factory. Its continuous push for material cost savings. So there’s a lot of things going on at cost of sales that are quite positive. And then of course the formation of the single silicon group, we’re also seeing some opex benefit on top of that.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Okay, George, I guess just on that front. What sort of incremental margins should we expect given some of the cost savings? What sort of incremental margins should we expect in the silicon business coming out of this?  And then I had a question on solar relative to the timing of that cost per watt road map. If you look at one of the major peers out there, they’re going to be at $0.90 incremental cost per watt this summer. So if you’re saying that gigawatt scale fab is roughly, say, $0.80 if I take the kind of mid-range of your guidance that you had said before, what sort of timing do you think that number will be achieved by given that peers are going to be at $0.90 incrementally by this summer? Thanks.
George S. Davis: Let me talk about the margin coming out. I think this quarter gives you a good example of the leverage that we’re seeing. As we’ve pointed out, in Q2 over a comparable period, as we roll through some of the improvements that we’ve seen, we’re eight points of operating margin to the good. Five points of that, from a waiting standpoint five points of that was in the gross margin area and three points in opex. So I think we can, you know, we’ll continue to see leverage both in gross margin and operating expense and coming out of this. I think again we announced the fact that we’re moving some of our manufacturing and merge and transit activity to a hub within Singapore. So I think there’s things that we’re going to continue to do that should add to the benefits that we’re already seeing.
Michael R. Splinter: So Tim, on the second question on the cost road map, the answer is as soon as we have a gigawatt factory up and running, one of our customers has a gigawatt factory up and running in large scale volume, which is going to take some years, it’s probably going to take a couple years to get it at very high volume. I really think specific, very precise cost numbers are hard to make at this time when we’re just first starting up initial factories. I think we’re going to learn an awful lot and as we do we can update with real numbers. Our numbers are theoretical certainly at this point. it isn’t that we haven’t analyzed them in detail. We have, our customers have. Our customers have confidence in them and have confidence in improving over what we’ve projected. But we gotta get into real production and move up the real learning curve and that’s what I think everybody in our company is so excited about. Now is the time to really get after that and do it for real.
George S. Davis: And Tim, I think you see with a lot of competitive estimates that particularly on the smaller form factors that it’s always about cost per watt, but you never get cost per watt installed and that’s a big factor. 
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: (inaudible) pricing.
Michael R. Splinter: Pricing is certainly different than cost.
George S. Davis: Yeah, exactly.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Of course. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray.
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: Hi. Good afternoon, Mr. Splinter, Mr. Davis, and team. Thanks for taking my call. Can you explain why the sales in your energy and environmental section was down quarter on quarter?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah. It was really pretty minor. It was down $37 million. It was really our sales out of our PWS group.
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: And PWS is what exactly?
Michael R. Splinter: That’s the wafer sawing business.
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: And you know, I’m hearing the solar customers complaining of long lead times for the HCTS equipment, which I guess is PWS. So is there, was there any decline in output there at HCTS to explain that decline in sales?
Michael R. Splinter: No. I think what you’re seeing is, quite frankly, just kind of a timing of sales and we expect the second half quite frankly in sales to be up significantly in that area. I think all of the, everybody in the space is dealing with very significant ramp in customer demand and so lead times are certainly impacted somewhat, but that’s really not the issue here and we feel quite good about the outlook for the second half of the year.
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: That’s great. What are lead times today? On the call, in the prepared remarks you mentioned that higher capacities are in progress. What are lead times now and what do you think they will be in about six month’s time? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, I mean, we’ve got a number of different solar products all of which have different lead times. On the crystal and silicon side it’s –
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: (Inaudible) in particular.
Michael R. Splinter: I think six to nine months on the outside and four to six months on certain products. So just depends on which products. And then obviously on the bigger tools for the sun fabs we have a little longer lead times.
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: And where would those six to nine months lead time on the first products go in another six months? Would you reduce that to three months or six months?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah. I (inaudible) forecasting we certainly see it a road map to bring it down and I think that’s one of the advantages that both HCT and Baccini saw and joining with Applied is our ability to help them manage the ramp, bring their cycle plants down, all the things that we’ve done in numerous businesses.
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: That’s fair. And one more question if I could. Sharp recently announced a triple junction product using (inaudible). Do you see triple as a future upgrade in your road map similar to the way that your single junction customers are now upgrading to tandem?
Michael R. Splinter: Actually, I believe Sharp’s triple junction, Sharp has had a triple junction for a long time. They’ve used their own CVD equipment. They created a joint venture with Tokyo Electron to execute this. People are going to explore lots of things to improve the performance and efficiency, but really it depends whether adding that complexity results in reduced cost per watt. So there’s lots of things you can do to improve efficiency, but if they don’t reduce cost per watt they won’t get implemented in the production. 
Jesse Pichel – Piper Jaffray: That’s good. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve O’Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Steven O’Rourke – Deutsche Bank Securities: Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, I want to make sure that I just understand the energy and environmental solutions operating loss on the (inaudible) increase quarter over quarter pretty substantially. How should we expect that to trend over the next couple quarters and what’s fundamentally driving that?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, I think most of it is growth in operating expenses. We had a little lighter revenue offsetting that. I think they’re going to see revenue pick up and absorb a lot of that expense. So again, we’re trending for break even pretty rapidly.
Steven O’Rourke – Deutsche Bank Securities: Are the costs rising substantially with the start ups that you have in progress now?
Michael R. Splinter: Oh, yeah. We’re supporting basically eight start ups all over the world and then building out just the normal capability to run a business.
Steven O’Rourke – Deutsche Bank Securities: Fair enough. As far as the Baccini business goes, are you able, how much can you increase shipments this year over last year just on a percentage basis. And considering the market position you have do you have any pricing strikes there that you could execute?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, you know, I think in Baccini it’s, we’re seeing substantial increases over last year, as you would expect. We haven’t, we’re not going to guide this specific, but certainly we’ve seen very, very strong revenue increases and we’re going to be booking, we’ll take our first revenue in Baccini in Q3 and you’ll get a sense from what we report of the impact there.
Steven O’Rourke – Deutsche Bank Securities: Fair enough. One last question. How do you expect SST orders to trend over the next couple of quarters?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, I mean, I think clearly we have been pleased all year with the strength of the flat panel display business, so we have record orders in Q1 followed by the second best quarter ever in Q2. We see it coming off throughout the year as we see it, then we’ll start to see revenues ramping as they meet the order pattern. But again, it’s been a substantially stronger demand pattern than we thought we would see coming into the year.
Steven O’Rourke – Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you.
Linda Heller: Kara, we’ll take one last question and then we’ll make our final remarks.
Operator: Yes, Ma'am. And your final question comes from (inaudible) with Lehman Brothers.
Lehman Brothers: Hi. This is (inaudible) calling for (inaudible). I have a question. When you mentioned that you’re taking additional cost-cutting measures (inaudible) outlook (inaudible) reductions that you talked about your analyst day and, if so, how should we think about your opex levels throughout the rest of the calendar year?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, I think opex levels we’ve been able to manage the expansion of opex in our growing businesses and opex has been coming down as we’ve gotten the benefits of consolidating our single silicon group. Really rationalization of spending across the company. So we’ve taken a lot of action already and I would say that the stuff that we’re doing now in Q3 really is taking down temporary employees shutdowns and things along those lines. Given the fact that it looks to be a bottom and we would expect revenue in the quarters to begin coming up in Q4. 
Lehman Brothers: And then in terms of solar, you mentioned that the second half of the calendar year should be up. Is there (inaudible) do you see one of the quarters actually being a function in revenue recognition or should this kind of trend really early? And then how are you going to (inaudible)?
Michael R. Splinter: Yeah, no, we, I think it’s still too early to give a guidance on the pattern. Again, we expect the bulk of the revenue for the orders that we talked about and the contracts that we talked about to be in 2009 and the exact pattern of that will really depend on how well the sign offs go and our first fabs and we’re right in the middle of that. So it’s too early to call that.
Lehman Brothers: That’s fine. Thanks a lot.
Linda Heller: Okay. We’d like to thank you for joining us in our discussion on Applied Materials’ financial results. We’d like to remind you that a replay of this call and its supporting slide package will be available on our web by starting at 5:00 p.m. today and will remain posted until May 28th. Thank you for your interest in Applied Materials. This concludes our call.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

George Davis: Thank you, Randy. Good afternoon,everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q1 was a dynamic quarter for thecompany. We met or exceeded our targets in all respects while experiencing verydifferent end market conditions in our business segments. We took steps toaddress our operating performance and cost structure in our semiconductorequipment and related services businesses, while at the same time investing tomeet the growing ramp in our solar and display units. We also increased our sharerepurchase activity to return value to stockholders, reflecting our optimism inthe long-term potential of Applied. Order momentum was particularly strong inQ1, a turnaround in display resulted in new orders rising by 13% over Q4significantly exceeding our target of down 5% to 15%. High consumer demand isdriving capacity additions across all major LCD customers. Our order book alsoreflected the first orders related to our SunFab thin film solar lines. Theseorders increased our order performance by approximately 7 points. As expected, we experienced lowerdemand for semiconductor equipment driven primarily by DRAM customers. Backlogfor Q1 increased about $400 million to $4.1 billion. Backlog adjustments wereminimal and totaled $32 million. We completed the acquisition of Baccini after the close of Q1, so those results and anyadjustments related to the acquisition are not yet reflected in our numbers. Revenue for Q1 decreased 12% to$2.1 billion, slightly better than our target of down 13% to 18%. This decreasefrom Q4 reflected lower net sales to DRAM and LCD manufacturers, partiallyoffset by higher sales in our Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. Gross margin for Q1 decreasedmodestly versus last quarter to 44.8% from 45.5%, primarily due to the effectof lower revenues, partially offset by lower material costs and our costreduction efforts. Q1 operating expenses were $562million and included restructuring charges of $38 million for severance costsrelated to Applied's cost reduction plan announced on January 15th and the $11million for implant facility retirements. Our estimate for severance cost hasincreased since the announcement, primarily due to costs associated withexpected international reductions. Operating income decreased to$373 million or 18% of revenues. Non-GAAP operating income was $493 million or24% of revenue. Net income was $262 million or $0.19 per share at the high endof our target range of $0.16 to $.20 per share. Excluding the impact of thecost reduction plan related charges, EPS would have improved by $0.02 andexceeded our guidance for the quarter. Non-GAAP net income of $345million or $0.25 per share reflected a 26% decrease from Q4. Non-GAAPadjustments are detailed in the press release. Now I would like to discuss oursegment results. As noted in our press release and in our recent AnalystMeeting in New York,we have renamed two of our segments. Adjacent Technologies has been renamedEnergy and Environmental Solutions, or EES, reflecting that organization'sclear focus on energy. Fab Solutions has been changed toApplied Global Services, or AGS, to reflect our decision to manage allservice-related activities in that unit. This will result in service revenuefor display and solar being included in AGS going forward. We will provide segment levelreconciliation on our website to facilitate your segment analysis. There was nomaterial solar service in fiscal year '07, so the adjustments will only affectthe display segment. For Q1 '08, display service revenue was $24 millioncompared to $35 million in Q1 '07. Let's now look at the Q1 resultsin the segments. Silicon orders of $1.1 billion were down 20% over Q4, asdemand for equipment from DRAM customers declined further while foundry andlarger customer demand remained low. Our order composition was DRAM, 34%; FlashMemory, 26%; Foundries, 14%; Logic and other, 26%. Orders for 70-nanometer and belowtechnology represented 85% of silicon orders. Q1 silicon net sales were down18% compared to Q4 in-line with expectations, again primarily due to decreasedinvestment by DRAM and Logic customers. In the face of falling revenue,operating income performance in Silicon Systems was strong at $445 million or36% of sales. Ongoing effective cost controls, as well as disciplined portfoliomanagement and material cost reductions, all contributed to improvingperformance. In Applied Global Services, Q1orders were down 6% from Q4, primarily due to lower orders for spares in-linewith industry conditions and declining fab utilization. Net sales decreased 2%from Q4, due to seasonally lower sales for spares, partially offset byincreased factory software sales. Operating income decreased 7%,compared to Q4, in-line with a decrease in revenue and mix. These numbersinclude display service for the first time. Display orders for Q1 for equipmentwere up 363% from Q4 and up 1,500% year-over-year, as LCD customers began toinvest again in response to rising LCD panel demand. Display sales of a $133million were down from Q4 as expected, reflecting the low order activity seenin fiscal 2007. Operating income decreased to $34million or 26% of net sales due to lower revenue levels and product mix,partially offset by lower cost. Again, these numbers reflect onlyequipment-related revenue and orders. Q1 orders in Energy and EnvironmentalSolutions totaled $260 million, up 165% from Q4, and they include recognitionof our first applied SunFab thin film line orders and the first full quarter oforders for our precision wafering system products. Net sales of $122 million, was up98% from Q4 and they were driven by increased solar-related revenue includingthe contribution of the PWS revenue and higher sales of our ATON tool. The Q1 operating loss for Energy andEnvironmental Solutions of $48 million resulted from increased operating costassociated with a build-out of our global thin film and crystal and siliconsolar team, M&A charges related to the HCT acquisition and costs related tothe expansion of solar marketing efforts. Next, I would like to discuss ourbalance sheet and cash flow. We continue to have strong cash flow performance,generating $390 million in cash from operations, which represent 19% ofrevenue. We are investing in working capital to support the solar and displayramps while managing SSG inventories in-line with industry conditions. We maintain our long-termobjective for cash from operations at greater than 20% of revenue, but weexpect that fiscal year '08 levels will be impacted somewhat during these ramps.Working capital changes in the quarter reflected this pattern with reductionsin inventory related to semiconductor equipment, offset by the increase ofworking capital to support the solar growth. We ended the quarter with cashbalances and marketable securities of $3.36 billion. In Q1, Applied returned $683million or 175% of operating cash flow to its stockholders. Of this amount,$600 million was for the repurchase of 34 million shares at an average price of$17.84 and $83 million was for cash dividends. We remain committed to generatingstrong cash flows and funding our investing needs while returning excess cashto our stockholders. We expect to spend between $300 million and $500 millionon share repurchases in Q2 '08. This is in addition to the $334 million inspending related to the close of the Baccini acquisition made at the beginningof the quarter. Now I will turn the call over toMike Splinter for his perspective on the quarter and his view of the keyindustry and market changes affecting our business. Mike?
Mike Splinter: Thank you, George. Q1 performancewas at or above our targets and the strong bookings in display and solar gavefurther evidence of the solid foundation of our growth plans. During thequarter, Applied Materials faced a weak global market for semiconductorequipment and at the same time, experienced a significant upswing in demand forour display products. 2008 is a pivotal year forApplied Materials to focus on execution and growth. We have restructured ourindustry leading silicon equipment business to improve operational performanceand competitiveness across our product portfolio. We have expanded the role ofApplied Global Services to be the service provider for all of our businesses totake advantage of our global footprint and we are investing to meet theextraordinary customer demand for our display and solar products. In a tough year for our core siliconbusiness, we have great optimism about our long-term prospects. In 2008, weexpect to extend our leadership in silicon equipment, establish Applied as thekey enabler to the solar industry and significantly expand our served marketand display. We intend to do this while maintaining a disciplined operatingmodel that generates strong profits and cash flow. Let me touch on some of thedetails about the cost reduction actions we took in Q1. In semiconductorequipment-related services, we announced a global cost reduction plan designedto generate about $150 million in annualized savings. We believe these savingsare achievable from the efficiencies of moving to a single silicon businessunit and the related product portfolio rationalization. This was a difficult,but necessary step that affected approximately 1,000 people in theseorganizations. This action is part of a roadmapdeveloped by our Silicon Systems Group to improve its operating model by 4points over the next three years, while funding the R&D, as necessary, tofurther improve our product competitiveness. During this down period, oursemiconductor team is working hard with customers to gain acceptance of our newproducts. New technology solutions including single wafer oxidation steps and E.HARPfor next-generation shallow trench isolation are gaining momentum. Metal and gate tech continue toadvance ahead of the competition, and we are collaborating with key memory customerson advancing the state-of-the-art for self-aligned double patterning, which nowappears to be the only technology that enables flash memory to move below 30 nanometers. Applied Global Services hasbroadened its scope to provide services for display and solar customers. Weexpect to offer an expanded suite of technically differentiated services inthese areas by leveraging the products and technical resources of AGS. This is how we can provide oursolar customers with comprehensive service including process support, partsservice, abatement, and manufacturing systems. During the quarter, we signedour first solar service contract for a SunFab line. In addition, we are expanding ourservice offerings in our core business from 200-millimeter productivity upgradesto chamber performance services and integrated software. Display has certainlyprovided the biggest positive in the first quarter. Strong end customer demandfor large format flat panel TVs has led to the need for significant capacityadditions. 2008 looks to be a record yearfor new orders and display, and could be a record year for revenue, even thoughwe expect revenue in the first half to be soft in-line with the low order levelfrom last year. We have significantly increasedour served available market in display with the launch of the new AKT-PiVot forarray PVD. Our leadership team in display is managing the double challenge ofmeeting an unprecedented ramp in LCD-related demand while supporting the PECVDcomponent of our rapidly growing SunFab line. Display has developed a highlyoutsourced model for manufacturing over the past several years and the supplychain supporting this model is ramping in-line with demand. And ramping fast isexactly what we're doing in solar. Scale is an important factor in lowering thecost per watt of our solar over time. At our New York Analyst Meeting,we talked about how we see the industry moving to take advantage of the scalethat our SunFab and film production lines provide using our industry leading 5.7square meter glass. Our thin film solar approach isgaining traction and enthusiastic customer acceptance. We were pleased to berecognized as the Green Energy Innovator of the Year by the prestigious Platt'sGlobal Energy Awards for our pioneering work on the Applied SunFab Thin FilmLine. In addition to our work in thinfilm solar, we are investing to build our capabilities for crystalline siliconas well. With the close of our acquisition of Baccini, Applied Materials is nowoffering products in the high value-added areas of the crystalline siliconsolar process. Areas where we offer differentiated products to lowermanufacturing costs while providing systems that create and process in ourwafers, all with the end goal of lowering the cost per watt which will increasethe end market. Looking forward, demand for solaris robust and growing and we are in discussions with many new customers. We arealso happy to report that our existing solar customers are talking about repeatorders. Overall, our solar business is accelerating and at the same time,Applied Materials technology is accelerating the adoption of solar around theworld. Unfortunately, the economicenvironment in the U.S.and the world is not as bright as the outlook for solar. We see the uncertain U.S. economicenvironment and the potential for slowing global growth to be our near-termchallenge. This is all set for AppliedMaterials by the positive momentum toward investment in clean energy, as aneconomic and political priority. Silicon Systems is facing a softinvestment environment. We said in our last call the wafer fab equipmentspending is forecast to be down 5% to 15% in 2008 and it's still looking thatway. In memory, DRAM is expected to be down greater than 30% and NAND flash isup but not enough to completely offset the difference. Foundry spending is expectedto be modestly down and investment for Logic should be roughly flat. The environment for display thisyear is much improved with expectations that industry investment will be upabove 40% in 2008, driven by an LCD TV market that is projected to grow atannual rates greater than 28% from 2007 to 2011. The build-out of Gen-8.5 acrossthe industry is coming fast as every manufacturer is speeding to add capacity.Looking forward with Sharp leading the way on Gen-10, we can expect the nextwave of flat panel TV factories. Overall, Applied Materials ismoving prudently in some areas and investing broadly in others to optimize ourperformance through these exciting and challenging economic times. Our costreduction plan for the silicon sector is well timed for the market conditionswe face and our strengthened solar and display is outpacing our expectations. Our employees are driving oursuccess and are putting their energy behind the projects and initiativesfeeling our progress. As a company, Applied is focused on execution in 2008 todeliver on the first leg of the growth commitments we made. And now I'll turn the call backover to George to provide our targets for the next quarter. George?
George Davis: Thank you, Mike. Our targets forQ2 are that we expect orders to be in the range of down 5% to up 5%. This iscoming off very strong order performance in Q1 and reflects expected strengthin solar and display. We expect revenue to be in therange of flat to up 5%. We expect EPS to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.22 pershare, in-line with mix effects and higher spend in solar and display. Thank you, Randy. Let's open thecall for questions please.
Randy Bane: That completes our preparedremarks. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. Operator, pleasebegin with the first question.
Operator: Our first question comes from theline of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Great. Thank you. Congratulationson the display order execution there. My question is how sustainable do youthink this momentum is. For example, can Applied exit the year with tradebookings tracking at over $2.5 billion annual run rate, do you think that's possible?
George Davis: Steve, I think what we are seeingis a substantial push by our customers to pull display orders into the firsthalf of the year. And I think our order outlook, while we are not being able tomaintain the record level of orders that we achieved in the first quarter, allevidence is we'll have another strong quarter for display in the secondquarter. But is that run rate sustainablethroughout the year? No. We still think overall, that orders for the year forthe overall company will be up, as we discussed at the New York meeting.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Can I ask the second question?Can you share any color on Moser Baer's announcement yesterday that they hadsecured additional solar equipment? Can you give us any color of how AppliedMaterials began the primary equipment prior to the Moser Baer?
Mike Splinter: Well, Steven, first of all, asyou know, Moser Baer was our first solar thin film customer and we have been indiscussions with them for sometime. So as we said in New York, we are in discussions with somemajor customers on gigawatt scale fab lines, but we don't have a specific thingto announce today.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay, thanks, and congratulationsagain.
Mike Splinter: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Harlan Sur with Morgan Stanley.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Hi, good afternoon. Niceexecution on the quarter. I think it's fair to assume at this point that theteam is probably in negotiations with all of your initial customers for theirnext round of expansion on the solar side. So, I guess the question is, whatkind of ramp rates are we talking about here? Are we going to see second phaseexpansion maybe doubling the initial capacity, and then a big step up to, let'ssay, a few 100 megawatts of capacity or even gigawatts of capacity?
Mike Splinter: It really depends on the customerHarlan. We said in New York, we are discussing with up to four people on prettylarge scale gigawatt kind of scale factories that almost everyone of ourcustomers today just thinking about a follow-on factory, some significantmagnitude bigger than their first one.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then my secondquestion, as you mentioned in the last call, Mike, that your pipeline supporteda growth outlook for at least your silicon business to grow in the secondquarter order-wise directionally. Is that still the case here in April?
Mike Splinter: Yes. So we think that siliconorders in revenue will be up modestly in Q2, but I certainly wouldn't call it amomentum at this point.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri - Citi: Hi, couple of things. First ofall, Mike, if I look at the thin film bookings, it looks like maybe by the endof April, you will have booked maybe 400 to 500 million of that, of whateverthe contract value that you currently have is. So, can you give us an idea,based upon contracts you have signed today, how many orders do you have beyondwhat you have included, which you will have booked in January and April?
Mike Splinter: I am going to let George answerthe first part of your first question. Tim, I will catch up with you on thesecond part.
George Davis: We booked a 160 this quarter. Weare not going to forecast the specifics for next quarter, but we do anticipatebooking some additional orders off of last year's contracts. So, we expect tobook the majority of all those during this year as we've said already. There isno change in that outlook. Whether we get 50% of it in the first half or not,we are not going to guide that right now.
Timothy Arcuri - Citi: Okay. My second question is,George, can you give us some idea then on the backlog? You haven't had thismuch backlog in terms of months since 2003, late '03, and you posted fourstraight double-digit sequential revenue growth quarters after that. So can yougive us some idea of the age of the backlog? How much of that is shippablewithin six months, for example?
George Davis: I think what you are seeing ismore of a balance issue than any change in the dynamics of our backlog. I mean,you have more of longer lived orders both in display and in services making upthat mix. So that's a little bit of the phenomenon you are seeing. Most of theorder, the behavior for the orders in terms of when they are going to berecognized for instance on the semiconductor equipment side is basically withinsort of the normal pattern quarter-and-a-half out that we normally see.
Randy Bane: Operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Jay Deahna with J.P. Morgan.
Jennie - J.P. Morgan: Hi, it's [Jennie] here in for JayDeahna. Can you give us a status update on the initial SunFab installed; areyou still targeting working panels by mid year?
Mike Splinter: Yes, [Jennie], we are expectingproduction output by the middle of the year and things are moving along quitewell, for real detail though, I think you have to ask Moser Baer the specificquestion, it is their factory.
Jennie - J.P. Morgan: Are you still expecting overallcompany orders to be flat to 10%, revenues to be flat and modestly down infiscal '08, as you had said at your Analyst Day?
Mike Splinter: Yes, that's right. We are notchanging that projection at this point.
George Davis: That's correct.
Jennie - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks a lot and nice work on thequarter. I know some of your cost reduction efforts have come from the exit ofsome of your select semi-cap businesses like Ion Implant, ECP. What othermeasures exactly you are taking to further reduce cost in that segment?
George Davis: The headcount reductions wetalked about, that was the January 15th announcement; talking about theheadcount reductions both in the Silicon Systems Group, the Services Group thatsupports the semiconductor equipment side. And then, all the staff groups thatare within that were impacted as well. So, the headcount impacts which willprimarily be felt as we roll-out through the year were a big part of that costsavings. And that's really what's driving the bulk of the cost savings.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. So it's nothing like supplychain management and things like that, that's the driver, it's mainly theheadcount reductions?
George Davis: Well, over the long run, we'vetalked about the global supply chain strategy that Tom and his team are puttingin place and I think that'll continue to drive. We've obviously had a focus onmaterial cost reductions year-in and year-out. But we believe we need to reallysignificantly expand our global supply chain to get to the next level andthat's what Tom and his team are working on. So we expect that over time tohave a big impact. But I was really talking more about what we're seeing in Q1.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, great. And just oneclarification on the numbers, the items associated with acquisition, was thatin cost of goods?
George Davis: The bulk of it was in cost ofgoods.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thanks a lot.
George Davis: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer & Co.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Hey, great. Thanks for taking myquestion. Something I just don't understand about guidance, you're highlightingkind of flattish guidance as solar and kind of display driven sort of quarter.But you're also suggesting that silicon systems businesses will be booking flatto slightly higher. So what's going to drive sort of the minus 5% Q-over-Q kindof scenario in your guidance for orders?
Mike Splinter: The big thing that is on thecautious side is that this is off the peak on displays. Display was anincredible quarter for orders in Q1 as George has alluded to, up 1500%year-over-year. So we are going to be a bit off that peak in Q2.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. Perfect, Mike, and thatleads into my next question. If I just look historically, even after youpurchased Applied films, the peak and the last peak in flat panel display,CapEx spending for your order number was roughly $355 million in the Octoberquarter of '06 and now you are booking $555 million. Is that a fair comparisonor is ATON really sort of driving the difference here between peak to peak?
George Davis: No. The apples-to-applescomparison is really you have to pull -- you had serviced in your $355 million,so it was $310 million for equipment.
Mike Splinter: So, it gave a bit little biggerdifference.
George Davis: Yeah. So it's really anextraordinary quarter for display.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. So it's fair to say thatdisplay business is heavily front-half loaded and pretty much loaded in theJanuary quarter.
George Davis: Yeah, I wouldn't discount that. Ithink they are going to have a strong second quarter and probably will exceedthe previous record as well, but it's going to be hard to top this quarter.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. Got you. One last kind ofquestion, George you had mentioned that you got 7 percentage points of bookingsgrowth from SunFab that would imply a $175 million in bookings?
George Davis: The exact number was $160million.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: $160 million, okay. So justwondering why the other part, the crystalline silicon side is just kind ofrunning flattish. Why we haven't seen growth this January quarter like aseasonally slow period for crystalline silicon? Or is there some otherexplanation why we are not seeing bigger growth there outside of SunFab?
George Davis: Now remember also within the EESGroup, we also have glass and web, so you've got a number of moving parts. Youcan't, and again I am not going to breakout every detail of the order book, butyou had kind of a run rate level of PWS orders in that. And so I think wedidn't see anything that would suggest that you are having a drop off.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you.
George Davis: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Yeah. Hi. A quick question onyour SunFab. It seems like you have pulled in the order recognition by at leasta quarter. Can you talk about what specific milestones you might have achievedparticularly with demonstrating performance on tandem solar cells that you nowhave SunFab orders being recognized?
George Davis: Satya, what we had said, is thatour order recognition policy was, when we believed that we were both within 12months of sign-off with the customer, and we had assurance that the supplychain was available to serve that order and all prior orders, then we would goahead and book. And so these orders set that criteria.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: So, is it fair to assume thatover the last three months you have increased your confidence of demonstratingyour specs on the tandem cells at your customers sites or your?
George Davis: I think our confidence across theboard on solar continues to grow, and that’s sort of reflective of what we'realso seeing from the customer side as well.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay, that's helpful. And when Ilook at your Silicon Group, I'm trying to reconcile what I'm seeing with youguys with the other companies, the peak, the trough orders are down 45% for youguys in silicon over the last three quarters. Most of your peers are downbetween 10% and 20%. And if I also look at your comments that CapEx will bedown 5% to 15% this year, and your comments of taking share; you lead the bookabout $1.4 billion a quarter in silicon on average each quarter to get to justdown 10%. What's the disconnect? Are youlooking at a pretty steep hockey stick recovering silicon bookings in the backhalf of the year?
George Davis: Yeah. We said that we saw thatsecond half would have to be significantly stronger than the first half inorder for the scenario to play out that not only we were seeing but most peoplewere forecasting for the industry. And we've already gone over some of thetiming issues, one customer made a big difference in timing issues in thepervious quarter and again, I don't have your data right in front me. But ourview really hasn't changed about what has to happen in '08.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: And real quick, you are guidingto basically down EPS and up revenues, what are the moving parts as to why thatshould be the case in May?
George Davis: Yeah. What we've done is actuallywe moved the order guidance up $0.02 and really from where we were last quarteron flat, up 5%. And I think it was a given, we know we're going to continue toincrease our investment in solar. We know that there are some revenue mixissues that may play out. So, I think it’s just representative of the volatileenvironment that we're in and the continuing investment that we've got and wethink it's the right range, but we have moved it up $0.02.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Good order guys. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Mehdi Hosseini with FBR.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: Thanks for taking my question. Iwant to better understand the thin film bookings. Can you please help meunderstand of the initial capacities that are out there for qualification; whatis the current output? What is the kind of megawatt of production capacity thatis out there, so that you could actually attract additional customers? And the number two question hasto do with the specific line-up that you have. Are you planning to acquire, orto have all the different pieces of equipment manufactured in-house because Iunderstand that some of the pieces are actually outsourced and what is yourstrategy forward in that area?
Mike Splinter: I am not quite sure of your firstquestion. But overall in the industry, there was a little more than a gigawattof capacity installed in 2007 and we said 6 to 8 by 2010. So there is widerange of capacity to be added over the next few years. As far as our philosophy on whatproducts we are going to do internally and what we are going to source fromother suppliers in the SunFab thin film line, we are going to do the high valueadded steps internally. That's pretty much always been philosophy as how we dowell and how we make a good profit in this business. So, things like, CVD, PVD, areright in our skill capability. Some of the automation is. But things like anautoclave, we are not going to ever make an autoclave, I don't think. So that'sa lower value at piece of equipment. It's an important piece of equipment in aprocess, but I don't think could create a differentiation there.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: Just as a clarification on thirdpart of my question. I was trying to figure out what is the kind of capacityyou have as a demo out there. Is there a first line that is up and running thatyou can use to sell to potentially new customers?
Mike Splinter: We have a demo line inEisenhower. With that, we can show our technology to our customers, and theycan see how the technology performs.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: As it stands right now, you don'thave a customer that is actually shipping panels?
Mike Splinter: Yeah. Out of the SunFab line,that's correct, we said we will see production panels by mid-year.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: Okay. And then going back to thesecond part of my first question. What about, in terms of improving the yieldquality, is there any metrology part of the line that is critical that youwould want to do in-house and then how about TCO, some of the processors doneto help improve the efficiency rates?
Mike Splinter: Well, Mehdi, you have toremember, this is about moving square meters of glass and it has very fastthroughput times; the process just has to run. You might want to know whethersheets of glass are chipped, but other than that I expect our processors to runat high yield and under a good control. We don't think that you need any realmetrology, any kind of off-line metrology, if that's what you are thinking of.But something like TCO, yes, we would be considered, that's a step we wouldconsider. It has impact on yield. It's a high value-added, highly technical step.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: So that's an area that you couldactually would go out and acquire technology or develop internally?
Mike Splinter: We have the technology to be ableto do that.
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks somuch for taking the question. George, first just the quick one. I understoodyour commentary earlier about why the EPS is little bit lower on flat revenues.But what I am trying to understand is, is that above the line or below line? Inother words, is that all gross margin pressure or some of that going to come inthe OpEx side as well?
George Davis: I think it comes from both sides,Jim, and we had a lot of activities around shutting down factories and doingthings in Q1, that won't be doing at the same level in Q2. We've got increasinginvestment in solar. So a lot of the OpEx will come out of those areas, themanufacturing obviously and the cost of sales but increased investment. Also it's our biggest quarter forinvestment in our business transformation process where we're getting to thepoint where we're going to turn on the first part of that. And so, this is kindof the homestretch on that piece.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: So taking your revenue guidance,I could get to your EPS guidance by modeling a 300 basis point decline in grossmargin. But that's obviously not all the debt is going to come out of the grossmargin. Do you think it's half or you think it's less than half?
George Davis: I think that's too significant. Ithink you are really looking at the combination of things, obviously, it alsohappens to be a quarter where our stock option expense tends to be a little bithigher than the first quarter. So there are multiple items. I think mix and thevolatility of the outlook just lead us to say, we're comfortable moving ourguidance up $0.02. We're still guiding within that range or above where weachieved, even after you take out the cost of restructuring that we incurred inQ1. So we think it's prudent, given the environment.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Okay. If I could just ask onefollow-up. Obviously, very good things going on long-term in the solar businessand in the near-term in the display business relative to silicon business. Thelast time we had this much excess capacity in the silicon segment, with so muchof the business come from DRAM, it really took a couple of years to clean itout, not a couple of quarters. And I'm wondering why you think that would bedifferent this time?
Mike Splinter: Well, Jim, you can pretty muchsee the cutback in demand or in the capacity additions by the DRAM makers. Ithink you know those as well as I do. The thing that encourages me about demandis prices continue to stay very low and I think that we'll see devices;laptops, desktop, cell phones, all load up on DRAM bits which are veryinexpensive. So in almost every applicationthat you can think of for DRAM, I think you're going to see bit growth wellabove the estimates today. So, we're still thinking quarters and I don't thinkwe have a magic ball to see. We're still thinking that by the third quarter,the supply and demand balance is out pretty much.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Mike Splinter: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-upquestion from Tim Arcuri with Citi.
Tim Arcuri - Citi: Hi. George, now that you have allthese moving parts, can you give us some view as to what the kind of afinancial model might look like as revenue ramps in July and back half of theyear? For example; if you take kind of the current mix, what would gross marginlook like say $2.5 billion and $3 billion revenue?
George Davis: Yeah. Tim, I understand whereyou're going. Let me maybe characterize in a little different way. We expect tosee the operating model for the Silicon Systems Group to continue to improveover time. They are taking a lot of steps that I think will have both near-termand longer-term impact. So, their operating model over time will just continueto improve. On display, which is what I thinkyou are seeing is, we'll see most of the ramp in revenue at the end of theyear. So again, it will be how much of it comes in at the end of the year andso how much of that sort of manufacturing processes is absorbed and we see thebenefit of that leverage. Energy and Environmental Systems,as we said, while we'll expect to see both Baccini and PWSrevenue in there, we'll still be in the build-out phase for the thin filmbusiness and also we'll be incurring the M&A cost associated with both ofthose acquisitions at that same time. So I thinkyou're still really going to wait until fiscal year '09 to see the start of thepotential for Energy and Environmental. Display, it really depends on therevenue piece, but it should look very good at the end of the year and it lookspretty good quite frankly right now, and then silicon systems very, very strongperformance relative to their historical model.
Tim Arcuri - Citi: Okay. So George I guess, as youlook out into '09, you should be back in '09, you should be back on the samesort of margin model that you were back say in mid-'07?
George Davis: Yeah, I don't see any reason whywe wouldn't be.
Tim Arcuri - Citi: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Bin Pang with Harris & Company.
Bin Pang - Harris Company: Thanks for taking my question.Just a clarification on the pattern that you expect for Silicon Systems, you commentedthat you expect to see or the industry I guess expect to see hockey stickscenario in the second half. Is that going to be led by DRAM?
Mike Splinter: We think that it will first beled by foundry and then by memory and we do expect both flash and DRAM to comeback a bit in the second half of the year.
Bin Pang - Harris Company: So the memory capacity that youexpect would be added in your fourth quarter, or are you talking about yourfiscal fourth quarter?
Mike Splinter: Talking really about calendaryear on capacity on capacity ads.
Bin Pang - Harris Company: Okay. And one follow-up on theflat panel business. Is it possible to separate exactly how much of the orderstrength in the quarter that just passed was due to the hire or serve developmentmarket?
Mike Splinter: The bulk of what are seeing inthis quarter was our historical presence, PECVD tools tend to get orderedearlier in the cycle and so there is imbalance towards that.
Bin Pang - Harris Company: And I guess the follow-up, flatpanel orders will be for your newer products?
Mike Splinter: Yes, for array, for our colorfilter testing and the PiVot array PVD.
Bin Pang - Harris Company: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of CJ Muse with Lehman Brothers.
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: Yes, thank you for taking myquestion, hoping to sneak into probably display side, given that you're goingto see strong bookings in January and April in that lead times, nine plusmonths. Does that suggest that your FPD road should be higher in fiscal '09than fiscal '08?
George Davis: Right now, it looks like if youjust model it out, that we would sort of peak in revenue in the first quarterof '09, so in the first part of ’09. But we think we're going to see some ofthis benefit in '08, it's part of why we think there is disconnect right nowbetween The Street estimates where we're coming out this year and where we seewhich is, I think The Street has this down 10% and we are somewhere betweenflat and down 5% based on display having the biggest impact.
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: Got you. And then a follow-up, onthe margin side, when do you expect to breakeven on the energy environmentaldivision and what kind of initial operating margins are you expecting, as yourevenue the initial SunFab business?
George Davis: So, certainly, we expect tobreakeven in '09 for sure. And then in terms of the margins coming out of thegate, I think I am not going to forecast that. We will have to see. Becausewe'll have a lot of mix of businesses in there and quite frankly, the marginson the initial deals will vary depending on how much of the learning curve istaking place at which contract.
CJ Muse – Lehman Brothers: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. I think in yourprepared remarks, you mentioned service contracts booked with SunFab lines. Howdo the service contracts work with these new lines and how are they connectedto a standard warranty for example?
George Davis: Well, the service contracts comeafter the warranty period. Of course, during the warranty period, we take careof service, spares are purchased and then the service contract essentially isto take care of all aspects for maintenance on the line. And depending on thecontract, it might be multiple years of service.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: So you booked service contractsfor the lines that you've initially installed these couple of lines.
George Davis: Actually, I said we had onlybooked in the prepared. I said we booked one.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Fair enough.
George Davis: You got that first one. We got tobook one before you book a buzz.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Fair enough. And you talked aboutfollow on factories for SunFab. Will they all be tandem junction do you thinkand can you give us an update on when you think the first tandem junction lineis projected for startup? And when you might think a reasonable timeframe isfor product out?
Mike Splinter: So yes, I would think they areall going to be tandem junction from here on out. We may even see some upgradeson some of the single junction lines later on, but basically, around the end ofthe fiscal year, we will see some output from the first hand of junction line.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: So by October of this year, youwill see some output.
Mike Splinter: We think so. Yeah.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Fair enough. Thank you.
Mike Splinter: We said that we would ship, or wewill have shipped the first hand of junction line by the end of March.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Jay Deahna with J.P. Morgan.
Jennie - J.P. Morgan: Hi. It's [Jennie] here in again.Just a clarification. Have you signed one of the gigawatt contracts?
Mike Splinter: We have no announcement on thesign of gigawatt contract at the moment.
Jennie - J.P. Morgan: Do you expect when it will besigned in the next three to six months?
Mike Splinter: Well, you can never tell aboutcontract negotiations, but we are in serious discussions on the topic. Sohopefully, we can come to an agreement with at least one of the customers thatwe are having discussions with at this time.
Jennie - J.P. Morgan: And when you're negotiating thesecontracts, how do you get comfortable with their financial wherewithal; if theycould fund such a large contract?
George Davis: We look at all the normal thingswe look at for any customer, which is do they have financing, can they securetheir commitments with the appropriate instruments. So it's a balance of itemsthat gives us comfort.
Jennie - J.P. Morgan: Do they have to have it securedby the time they sign the contract?
George Davis: It varies depending on thecustomer.
Jennie - J.P. Morgan: Okay.
George Davis: And that's true, whether it's agigawatt scale or it's a smaller scale.
Jennie - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Yes. Thank you very much. Onemore question on the revenue recognition for SunFab. This revenue recognitionis going to be for the whole line at a time or you will do it by equipment byequipment?
George Davis: Our current plan is for the lineto be upon customer sign off.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So it's going to be like abig size whenever it happen, it won't be like per tools $20 million to $30million order.
George Davis: Right, for the initial ones,that's correct.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And the second question onthe EPS guidance, are you assuming any non-recurring charges in that guidance?
George Davis: No.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay.
George Davis: Again, we have the normal ongoingadjustments of stock-option expensing and M&A. But it doesn't include anyanticipated restructuring cost.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: So M&A means amortization ofintangibles?
George Davis: Correct. And all again, we have areconciliation of all that in the schedules with the release.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: All right. Thank you.
George Davis: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray.
Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray: Yes, good evening. Of the fourgigawatt factories, should we assume that's both crystalline and thin film?
Mike Splinter: No, you should assume that theseare thin film factories. In the crystalline silicon area, we're more sellingmachine by machine in our more traditional way, or our more traditionalbusiness model. I guess I would call it in that regard an example was ourATONs. We had our breakthrough in Japan selling our first ATONsystem, as these crystalline factories scale up I think they'll use more of ourlarge scale systems though.
Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray: You use the word utility scaleoften, did that mean you are in discussions with European utilities and is thata far fetched question? Is the SunFab so easy that a utility could run it andit wouldn't be outside of their core competency, assuming it came with someperformance guarantees from AMAT?
Mike Splinter: Well, I don't think we candisclose real customers, but utilities are different than power providers andwe have to look at how the industry is set up, but I think what you wouldcertainly say that we're in talks with companies who are interested in beingpower providers.
George Davis: All right, and many of ourcustomers have looked to put electricity into the grid out of their fabs.
Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray: I am under the impression thatOerlikon offers guarantees with respect to throughput and efficiency. DoesApplied offer that at current?
Mike Splinter: The Applied contract is setup onwatts out. So in the end, I think our customers want to produce watts andthat's what's so critically important. One that we often talk about is scale soyou mentioned utility scale, but the size of our panels allow the installationand wiring and bracketing to be done much more efficiently. And this is one ofthe areas why we chose to move to the larger size panel.
Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray: My question is, one of theadvantages of the big public thin film company we know now for solar is thatannually it gets throughput improvements of about 6% plus per year. Do youanticipate that the AMAT lines would also have similar annual improvements? Anddo you think there is a way for your service business to potentially capturesome of the value of a 6% plus annual throughput improvement on a watts basis?
Mike Splinter: Well, Jesse, one of the thingswhy we are so confident about our solar business is our history of 40 years ofdriving cost down. This has been hallmark of Applied Materials engineering, andI see that continuing. It's a thing we learned in silicon, we showed in displayfor the last 15 years. We have driven down the cost, helped our customers drivedown the cost of displays by 20 times to improve productivity. Now, we areusing the same capability in solar, and so I'm very confident we're going to beable drive our roadmap and be very aggressive on moving the cost down.
Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray: And can you capture some of thatimprovement through --
Mike Splinter: We'll see how the servicecontracts are structured. It will depend on the specific customer, but we likeperformance-based contracts. We have performance-based contracts today in thesilicon area. That means we can apply our technology. It's a win for us, it's awin for our customers and that's the way we like to schedule our contracts.
Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray: Great. Thank you so much.
Mike Splinter: You bet.
Randy Bane: Operator, we have time for onemore last quick question and then we'll make our closing remarks.
Operator: Our final question comes from theline Edwin Mok with Needham and Company.
Edwin Mok - Needhamand Company: Thanks for squeezing me in. Justa quick question on the $116 million for SunFab, you guys have said before youare going to have seven lined up in running by sometime this year, are weexpecting due to recognizing level of revenue for those otherwise?
George Davis: Our outlook really hasn'tchanged. We've said that we expect to book during this year; that we anticipatesome revenue at the end of this year but the bulk of the revenue for thecontracts that we are signed in '07 will be in early '09. 
Edwin Mok - Needhamand Company: Maybe a different way to askthis, sorry, just in terms of booking, you guys said you booked $106 million,but just one time?
George Davis: Right.
Edwin Mok - Needhamand Company: So you have six more lines inthis year, I mean, you don't book six times?
George Davis: Those orders represent more thanone order.
Edwin Mok - Needhamand Company: I see. Okay. Thanks for that,guys.
Mike Splinter: Okay. Thanks, Edwin and I thinkjust a clarification what we've said, we will ship seven lines by end our Q3.And just a final note, I'd just say, if you look at the orders we reportedtoday and the targets we set, it really reinforces our confidence in thestrength of our strategic direction. Applied is focused on execution in 2008.We're going to keep that focus and even in a difficult economic environment we'regetting the results and building terrific momentum. Thank you all for attendingtoday and look forward to talking with you in three months.

George Davis: Thank you, Randy and good afternoon everyone. Fiscal 2007was a strong year for Applied Materials, both financially and operationally. Wegrew revenue to record levels, achieved a 24% increase in earnings per share,and generated record levels of operating cash flow that allowed the company toreturn substantial cash to stockholders, while at the same time investing inR&D on pace with the highest levels in our history. Now I will comment on: both our fiscal 2007-year and fourthquarter results and then discuss the performance of our four segments. Forfiscal 2007, Applied's net sales were up 6% over 2006, led by strength insemiconductor memory capacity expansion throughout the year. Earnings per share were up 24% year-over-year and non-GAAPEPS was up 16%. Improving operating efficiency and portfolio managementactivities were key factors in achieving this performance in a year where webegan making substantial investments in our solar business. Non-GAAP adjustments are detailed in the press release. Neworders at $9.68 billion were 2% below fiscal 2006, as foundry and displaycustomers reduced their capital spending plans. Cash from operations increased 13% from fiscal 2006,reaching a record $2.22 billion or 23% of net sales. 2007 was also our year of entry into the solar market. Wehave been pleased by the strength of this market and the level of demand forour SunFab product. During the year, we revised our 2007 expectations for thinfilm solar contracts from an initial estimate of $200 million to more than $600million. And we have now exceeded that number as well. For the fourth quarter, our results were within the range weforecasted for orders and revenue and exceeded our target for earnings pershare. The company showed strong cash flow and improved balance sheetperformance as well. Orders totaled $2.21 billion for the quarter, down 3% fromQ3, with lower orders in silicon partially offset by order increases in ourother three segments. Backlog at the end of Q4 increased to $3.65 billion. Backlog adjustments for the quarter were positive at $383million, composed primarily of $311 million of HCT orders. We also benefitedfrom adjustments in display orders and foreign currency. Q4 revenue was 8% lower than Q3, and within our publishedtarget. Lower silicon revenue in Q4 was partially offset by increases in allour other segments. Gross margin decreased by two points to 45.5% in Q4,primarily due to the impact of lower revenue, product mix, plus the one-timecost associated with the facility closure and asset impairment. Q4 operating expenses were $30 million lower than Q3, withheadcount essentially flat at 14,550 employees. The reduction in OpEx came fromlower equity compensation expenses. Amounts received from the research anddevelopment collaboration agreement, and continuing cost focus, partiallyoffset by increased operating expenses related to the HCT acquisition and thesolar business expansion. Now, I will discuss our segment results. As anticipated,silicon orders for Q4 were down 17% from Q3, as customers decreased theircapacity additions. Our order performance was substantially above thesemiconductor equipment industry, due in part to a large order that was bookedat the end of our fourth quarter. In Q4, memory accounted for 67% of orders. Our ordercomposition was DRAM 45%, flash memory 22%, foundries 14%, logic and other,19%. Orders for 65 nanometer, and below technology represented 81% of siliconorders. The growing concentration of orders at the leading edge isbeing driven by NAND flash and logic customers’ technology buys at the 5Xnanometer and below applications. Q4 silicon net sales were down 15% compared to Q3 asanticipated, primarily due to lower spending by foundry and DRAM customers.Operating income was $550 million or 36% of sales, down in line with lowerrevenue levels and lower factory absorption. We formed the Silicon Systems Group in Q3 to drive bothproductivity and effectiveness in the semiconductor equipment business. We arealready starting to see the benefits of this change in all aspects of thebusiness, from shorter manufacturing cycle times and lower material costs, toincreased focus on commonality and engineering efficiency. Tom St. Dennis and his team have plans for continuing toimprove the productivity and operating efficiency of this organization, whilefully funding its product initiatives. We will cover the potential of this newstructure in more detail at our January analyst meeting. In fab Solutions, Q4 orders were up 14% over Q3 as customers’fab utilization increased. Net sales increased 3% over Q3 to $572 million, dueto higher spares and refurbished equipment sales. Operating income was up slightly,primarily due to higher revenue levels and product mix. Display orders for Q4 were up 80% from the low levelsexperienced in Q3, as panel makers began to experience more favorable marketconditions. Net sales were up 7% over the previous quarter. Operating incomeincreased slightly from Q3, reaching 26% of net sales. Cost reduction measuresand product mix changes accounted for the bulk of the operating improvement. Adjacent technology orders totaled $98 million in Q4, up 83% from Q3. Net sales of $62 million reflected increased solar and web equipmentsales. The Q4 operating loss for adjacent technologies of $30 million, reflectthe charges of $9 million related to the HCT acquisition and increased spendingin solar research and development, partially offset by higher revenue levels. Next, I would like to discuss our balance sheet and cashflow. We continued to have strong cash flow performance, generating $693million in cash from operations, which represented 29% of revenue. Free cash flow in Q4 was $632 million or 27% of revenue, upfrom 22% in Q3. Working capital performance benefited from $191 millionreduction in accounts receivable and a $49 million inventory decrease. Capital spending for the quarter was $61 million,depreciation and amortization totaled $81 million, and DSO was at 79 days. Cash and investments decreased by only $25 million despiteseveral large cash outlays, including $463 million for the HCT acquisition and$200 million for a scheduled debt retirement Applied returned $483 million or 70% of operating cash flowto its stockholders. Of this $483 million, $400 million was for sharerepurchases that retired 19 million shares at an average price of $20.95, and$83 million was for cash dividends. Net cash proceeds related to employee stockprograms was $450 million during the quarter. We remain committed to generating strong cash flows andfunding our investing needs, while returning excess cash to our stockholders.Since the beginning of fiscal 2006, we have returned $6.1 billion tostockholders through share repurchases and dividends. We expect to spendbetween $500 million and $600 million on share repurchases in Q1 '08. Now I will turn the call over to Mike Splinter for hisperspective on the year and his view of the industry environment. Mike?
Mike Splinter: Thanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strategyfor 2007 was clear: growing the core, expand into new markets and achieve a newlevel of operating performance. And we delivered on all three! In 2008, with changing market dynamics, we will focus onexecution and efficiency in all of our businesses and on expanding the buildingwave in solar. First, let me summarize a few key achievements of 2007. Applied Materials surpassed our prior peak revenues and atthe same time, delivered double digit increases in profitability and earningsper share. This performance was particularly good considering theweakness in display CapEx and the modest growth of wafer fab equipmentspending. In our year-end call last November, I said that we would grow our SiliconSystems business by roughly 10% in '07 and that's exactly what we did, eventhough wafer fab equipment spending was expected to be up only about 6%. In Display, we nearly doubled our served market with therelease of our PiVot PVD system, and we grew share in CVD and our testingproduct line. Our solar business within our energy and environmental systemsgroup is off to a good start with over $700 million in contracts. In Silicon Systems, share gains in etch and inspection, werethe top priorities. We realized new product traction in etch, winning nine of14 run-offs at the leading edge of technology nodes, and we gained share drivenby applications for silicon and metal etch. We also beat our target for repeat orders for UVision, bywinning at four of the top five memory makers. This year, our PDC divisiondelivered record revenue and profit, to improve performance and enhancecustomer satisfaction; we took a major step and streamlined the organization bycombining all the semiconductor equipment divisions into the Silicon SystemsGroup. Recently, Hans Stork joined that team as Chief TechnologyOfficer, further enhancing our capability. Silicon Systems has momentum, withincreased customer collaboration and focus on operational efficiency. In fab solutions, customer factory utilization was lowerthan we thought it would be over the year. And as a result, our servicebusiness did not meet our growth expectations. We remain confident about thegrowth opportunities for this business due to our expanding install base andfab-wide breadth of services. We are earning a larger share of the business in Asia,a region that is traditionally been a challenge for service penetration.Today's announcement of our agreement with Elpida is one example of thatgrowth. We expanded our software product portfolio to offer completeapplication stack for customers to manage and optimize fab performance. And we broadened our capabilities for chambered cleaning, agrowing market, as smaller geometries require even more stringent control. In Energy and Environmental Solutions, 2007 was a year ofestablishing our position in solar. We launched our SunFab integratedproduction line for thin film solar, and we have announced a significant numberof contracts. In addition, we acquired HCT and have increasing traction withour ATON deposition system. As a result, bookings and revenues in the adjacenttechnology segment are starting to reach meaningful levels as our crystallinesilicon glass products grow . Operationally, we achieved success and we are makingprogress on efficiency and cost improvement. We have shown that we can acquirekey technologies and capabilities and smoothly integrate them into the companyand get results. We're actively managing our portfolio of products, asevidenced by our decision to exit beamline implant and electrochemical plating.And we continue to invest more than $1 billion in R&D, to grow our marketposition and shareholder returns. Before I comment on the upcoming year, I'd like to commendand thank the entire Applied Materials’ team for their achievements during2007. I am confident we have a great team and a solid foundation for the yearsahead. We see the first part of fiscal 2008 as challenging,particularly in the silicon businesses. It's a dynamic environment and cautionsignals from customers reflect uncertainty. We expect semiconductor CapEx to bedown roughly 5% to 15% during the year. We expect investment in DRAM to pull back, while flashshould continue to be strong. Investment by foundries was weak in 2007 and weexpect that foundries will remain cautious until their demand picture gainsclarity. Logic and foundry will follow roughly the same trend as in'07, with a focus around ramping production volumes in 65-nanometer andcompleting development of 45-nanometer technology. But, we expect to build onour momentum in etch and inspection and we are targeting our Silicon Systemsbusiness to outperform the market at a similar pace as last year. Our new organizational structure in Silicon Systems isexpected to improve operating expenses and margins through many projects,including further globalization of the supply chain. In these times of uncertainty, it is especially important todrive costs down systematically, concentrating on both short-term and long termactions to improve the performance of the business. We are focused on both. The environment for display is recovering; as factories arefull with high demand for large sized flat-panel TV's. The industry spend isexpected to increase more than 20% in 2008, with considerable upside and anapproaching product transition to Gen 10 systems. Orders are already improving, but revenue will only beginreal recovery in our second quarter. We expect to gain leadership in all fourof our product categories. The prospects for our Energy and Environmental Solutions businessare promising. The move we are making in solar is like a bow wave, broadeningout as we move forward. There is broad customer demand as thin film solar is now acompelling value proposition. Today's announcement of a new SunFab contractwith XinAo in Chinasignifies the breadth of the adoption of our 5.7 square meter format. We are focusing our team on execution, and we are shippingmachines and working with our customers to start up SunFabs around the world.We aim to create a worldwide solar farm standard with our 5.7 square metermodule format. In addition, we are developing our product portfolio incrystalline silicon by enabling thinner wafers and higher factory productivityin module efficiency. Overall, we delivered a record year in 2007 and we have setthe stage for 2008. We expect Silicon Systems will perform better than themarket in a very difficult environment. FAB solutions will expand share in Asia.Display will grow faster than FPD CapEx, and solar will effectively executetheir SunFab start-ups around the world. 2008 is our time to demonstrate the power of applyingnanomanufacturing technology to grow the company not only in our core butbeyond. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call back over to George for hiscomments about Q1. George?
George Davis: Thank you, Mike. Our targets for the first quarter of fiscal2008 reflect a first half softening in the semiconductor equipment markets fororders and revenue, compounded by a bottoming of display revenue in line with thetrough order levels experienced in the first three quarters of 2007. At the same time, the display team must prepare its supplychain and manufacturing resources to meet the requirements of upturns in bothflat-panel and solar. In light of this outlook, we are maintaining strictcontrols on costs across the company to manage the near term risk and arelooking to accelerate productivity improvements that are designed to capturepermanent cost reductions. Our targets for Q1 are; we expect orders to be down in therange of 5% to 15%, the impact of the large order I discussed before has thesingle biggest impact on our guidance relative to others in the industry. Ourtarget does not include any orders for our SunFab thin film production lines. We expect revenue to be down in the range of 13% to 18%. Thedrop in display revenue expected in Q1 '08 has a negative impact ofapproximately three points on our estimate. We expect EPS to be down in line with revenue, and in therange of $0.16 to $0.20. Thank you. Randy, let's now open the call for questions.
Randy Bane: That completes our prepared remarks. We will now begin ourquestion-and-answer session. Operator, let's begin with the first question,please?
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar withCredit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Yes, hi, can you hear me?
George Davis: Yes, say Satya.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Sorry about that. Just a quick question on your fiscal firsthalf comments on semiconductor orders: Most of your peers have actually guidedorders up sequentially into December and even talk about scenarios ofincreasing orders in March. Your orders were actually down in October in silicon. Why isit that you're not actually seeing that recovery in silicon?
Mike Splinter: I think it's primarily one major order. As we’ve looked atthe ups and downs of this thing, we looked at it in many different ways, reallynarrowed it down to one very big memory order in October.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay.
Mike Splinter: That’s really a timing issue, Satya.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. And a quick follow-up to that on margins: The gross marginswere down 200 bps sequentially. If I look back to fiscal Q2 of '06, you hadlower revenues with similar mix between the different product groups, buthigher margins: how would you sort of explain the year-over-year decline ingross margins? Are there any, meaningful, changes to the pricing environmentfor semiconductor products?
George Davis: No. We had some higher M&A impacts that would bereflected year-over-year, but it was primarily due to, we had some one-timeeffects that had greater than a one point impact on gross margin. So, if youlook at our operating margin, it was at least a point and a half above what wehad as a GAAP margin.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh, withCIBC World Markets.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If I kind of lookat your bookings guidance and continued softening in semis off of a $1.3billion mark, $1.3 billion was sort of the low point in terms of semi bookingsby my calculations in '05, and if we're really looking for CapEx down 5% to15%, I would have thought we could see some stabilization here off of yourOctober number. Now, should we interpret this as some market share loss or isthere some rotation happening here that you guys are a little bit less exposedto? I mean: what's going on in terms of semi orders seeing further softnessversus the bottom in '05?
Mike Splinter: Well, you asked a little bit of a complex question and Idon't necessarily want to go back and analyze '05, but if we look at what'shappening in the market today, I think what you will find is that it was a bigorder of timing. If we look forward and look into our Q2, we've gone over thisproject-by–project, what's happening product-by-product, what's happening,customer-by-customer, our bottoms up look is for increase in orders in Q2. But, and I can't be too specific about that at this point,because there's a long road ahead and a lot of both economic and financial datathat will happen at the year-end, as well as how the whole selling season goesduring the holiday period, but there's no real share loss in these numbers. Andreally there, when we look at the order picture, usually we think that therewill be multiple big orders during a quarter. It looks to us like everybody ispretty cautious during this yearend period.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Yes, okay. So it's just really a timing issue and lumpinessin the business? I mean your October quarter was pretty lumpy in terms of thatone customer booking at the tail end, so I guess that's really it. Just onsomething a little bit more positive here, I understand that basically, you'regoing through an installation of the SunFab on the thin film side here in Asia.Can you give us any kind of detail or any kind of granularity on how that'sproceeding and if you've got any more visibility on the lead time between aninstall and revenue recognition in the back off of '08?
Mike Splinter: I will let, George comment on revenue recognition. I wasjust out at that operation. It's in India.Our CVD system is on the floor. Our PVD system is there. The automation systemsare all there. Our team is set to go. The customer is finishing up thebuilding. They have a ton of people just working to complete it, so as far asany published schedule, we're on track there. We have everybody scheduled downto the hour on these kinds of projects and that goes for pretty much everyone. I'mreally quite excited about how fast I think we're going to learn as we buildmore and more of these SunFabs around the world
George Davis: So, on the revenue recognition and really on bookings aswell, might as well cover both at this point, our position really hasn'tchanged. We expect to begin booking these contracts some time in the first halfof our fiscal year. We've said that we believe that first revenue would come atthe tail end of our fiscal year, but the bulk of the revenue that we see fromcontracts today would be in early '09.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Great! Thank you, George.
George Davis: You welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri withCitigroup.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi, guys. Just kind of a big picture question: If you compareyour solar business to the semi business, and you look at your business modelthere, solar seems like more of a commodity than is semiconductor. It's reallyall about cost, and it seems like your tools represent about 70% of the cost ofthe line in solar versus only maybe 10% to 15% of the cost of the line in semi.So, if you also look at the customers, they're all trying to verticallyintegrate as well, so: would it seem logical that you also try to become morevertically integrated in that segment?
Mike Splinter: Hi, Tim. At some time you'll have to explain to me in moredetail your thoughts on this, I'm quite interested in them, but really, the waywe're thinking about this is if we can get many, many customers buildingSunFabs, we're going to be able to have thousands of engineers working ondriving the cost down. That's what's really going to make the market accelerateand expand and if we can be successful in establishing our 5.7 square meters asa worldwide solar farm standard, there's a very, very powerful business concept,so that's pretty much the path we are moving down. As you know, we've reallymoved a step beyond our normal equipment only horizontal business segment, butnow selling really the technology and starting up the entire fab for customers,guaranteeing output basically, and participating together with the customers, andenhancing the performance of those factories.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay, yes, I guess to me it just, if your tools really arethat value added, it just seems like it would be better over the long term foryou to actually make the panels yourself. I guess just as a quick follow-up,George, whatever your bookings for or your contracts were for solar in fiscal'07, you said they were more than $700 million. Can we assume that all of thatnumber, at least that number, will become orders during fiscal '08?
George Davis: We are not going to give out a specific guidance on that,but unless there is something that comes up on them that we don't see today, Iwould expect to be able to book them this year.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next went comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Thank you. Mike, how should we think about your commentaryabout the flat-panel equipment orders improving? Should we expect flat panelorders to be a gradual improvement for Q3 2008 or is it possible that we cansee a big step function increase in one quarter given that AMAT is stillgaining share in CVD and is expanding to PVD? How do you before see this flatpanel recovery occurring?
Mike Splinter: Well, what we see so far, we already saw a pretty good jumpquarter-over-quarter, and if you look year-over-year at our numbers they are, Ithink we said 80% quarter-over-quarter; year-over-year they're up way over 100%. So, that's the definition of a jump. From Q2 on out, I think it's hard tosay. It depends a little bit how fast Gen 10 factories come on, if one of theother major companies commit to a Gen 10, obviously we could see another majorjump in orders. In the shorter term, it's mostly filling in existing factoriesas fast as they can fill them in with equipment.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay. And if I could just change the topic to solar, can youguys give us an update regarding the synergies across the flat panel equipmentand the thin film solar equipment? Can we assume that AMAT successful flatpanel Gen 8.5 process results? Or: can we assume those are repeatable in thethin film solar equipment?
Mike Splinter: Well, the equipments are basically the same, Stephen, andthat's one of the things that gives us so much confidence that we're going tobe able to expand this factory base and grow the capacity very quickly is theCVD system is pretty much the same CVD system we use in the flat-panel area. We'reshipping already and the deposition system is the similar as we use in theglass business. So, we're quite confident about our equipment capability andour thin film capability in those two areas. Other products that we're buyingfrom third party suppliers are less sophisticated and are add-on process steps,so the critical ones we control so we're pretty confident about that.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Deanah withJPMorgan.
Jay Deahna - JPMorgan: Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?
Mike Splinter: Yes.
Jay Deahna - JPMorgan: Okay, Good afternoon, Mike. A couple of questions on solar:First of all: it looks like the bookings in applied technology has almostdoubled to $98 million in the fourth quarter from $55 million. I am justwondering: what drove that increase? And: over time, what is your strategy forcrystalline silicon? And: how do you see sort of your revenues balancing upbetween those two over time? And then the last question is: can give me yoursense on the competitive landscape in thin film solar equipment, in particularwith [Erlicon] and sort of identify who else is out there that couldpotentially do a whole line? Where is Allvac, etcetera?
Mike Splinter: Sure. So, on the silicon, crystalline silicon bookings areup to $98 million, really two factors. One is HCT, and the other is traction onATON, and as the crystalline silicon lines have gotten bigger, the productivityof ATON has really come into play. You have to have a fab 50 megawatts or abovefor ATON to really be effectively utilized and we're starting to see that now. Italso helps with efficiency and color uniformity, so it has multiple benefitsfor customers. What we're trying to do in the crystalline silicon area rightnow is to really get focused in those areas that really are critical to movingthe technology forward. Thinning wafers it was really the reason why we wentafter HCT, because we felt that their technology was critical to both handling andmoving to thinner wafers. This is important, because silicon is still so muchof a cost per watt. And we think if we keep going on a road map, we cut thenumber of [grams] for silicon in to half and then if we keep moving on thatroad map over the next few years, in half again, and then with our ATON tool asI just described, it really is another major factor in the performance of thecrystalline silicon. Now: how we view the relative revenue? Because ourparticipation in crystalline silicon is small and there's more competitionthere, and the popularity of our thin film lines right now, our thin film lineswill far exceed our crystalline silicon revenue by 2009, or in 2009. On the competitive landscape, the key here is the 5.7 squaremeter. No one else is in our 5.7 square meter space. Why is that important?It's important, because in the solar farm, and really in any solar installation,but where these products are aimed at is the solar farm area. You got to reducethe installation cost, the bracketing, the cabling, the inverter costs, themounting costs and that's really why we chose the larger size. Because we knowthat in an industrial-like installation or a major roof top installation on abig box building, you'll be able to drive those installation costs down withthe larger panels, and get an even bigger effect over just raw efficiency. So,if the cost per watt and efficiency are equal, the larger format will win inany major industrial application. So that's kind of it but Erlicon and Allvacare the big other players in thin film, both at the 1.4 square meter size.
Jay Deahna - JPMorgan: And just one quick follow-up: Do you see kind of a Moore'sLaw, to use an analogy, road map to get the efficiencies on thin film down tothe point where that could actually accelerate the market? Is that sort of byyour technologists, a clearly defined road map that your engineers can executeto with some level of confidence?
Mike Splinter: Yes, and I think Mark Pinto at our January 17th analystmeeting will kind of go overall of the elements of how we are thinking aboutwhat technology we have to develop and create to keep the efficiency rolling onthin film silicon. Silicon is a material people know, they can handle it andknow how to deposit it and we just think that the flexibility of that and thenumber of engineers we're going to have working on it are going to all help usdrive the efficiency up and the productivity up as well to reach the best costper watt produced in the industry.
Jay Deahna - JPMorgan: Thanks a lot, Mike.
Mike Splinter: Thanks, Jay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur withMorgan Stanley.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Hi, good afternoon. Mike, within your view of growingSilicon Systems business faster than the market in '08, I'm just wondering: ifyou can articulate which segments will be the drivers of that growth?
Mike Splinter: Sure. I pretty much noted it, but we're going to continue tofocus on our etch and PDC area for share growth and we expect to be competitivein all of our other areas. We fiercely compete in those areas over a longperiod of time; we expect to do well there. In PDC, as I said, we've gained additional traction inUVision; we think that's going well. We have a mask inspections system outthere that perhaps will get a little revenue in 2008. In etch if we look at, Ihighlighted some of the really critical leading edge kind of applications wewon, but if we look at the broader number, we participated in 60 run-offs, won41 of them, that are quite a bit above our historic average. So, we're prettyencouraged in those areas, and EPI has just been great as more and more of theDRAM guys have to use EPI. They use a lot more wafers than the logic guys, so EPIis a big play there.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great, thank you. And then given your CapEx, the widerange of the CapEx outlook for next year, maybe you could just articulate,which segment is going to be this biggest swing factor in determining what endof the range we come in. Is it going to be logic and foundries or is going tocontinue to be memory in your view?
Mike Splinter: Harlan, the way I'm looking at this right now is: the DRAMguys are going to pull back. We already see them pull back, so I think they'regoing to be down in something 20% to 30% range. We think flash will be up, butDRAM is so much bigger at this point, it's not going to make up for that. Andthen the foundries and logic kind of looking at their factory as you kind oflistening to them you'd think they are going to be down 10% to 15%. When youlook at their factories, their factories are full, filling up and you'd thinkfrom that standpoint, they would be more down like 5% on the year. But, I thinkwe have to wait till January and listen to the announcements that they're goingto make and modify our view at that point.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Last question for George: George, what's the tax rateoutlook for 2008?
George Davis: Harlan, well we're looking at the low 30s, so 30, 31.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great! Thank you very much. 
George Davis: You're welcome. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with LehmanBrothers.
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Iguess a couple questions here. First off, just directionally: can you commenton order outlook by segment?
Mike Splinter: Well, I mean, I think, we've given some indication clearlysilicon is down. We're not going to obviously guide by segment, but display isclearly showing positive momentum. Adjacent we'll have to see how that playsout. Obviously they have HCT fully embedded in there now. And then so thatbrings you to fab solutions and we expect to see usually Q1 is kind of a peakorder quarter for them, but for the outlook, we have a more moderate orderscenario for them. 
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: Typically, you'd show growth in that 1Q off of 4Q and youhad a pretty nice quarter in 4Q. Did you see sort of a pull-in from 1Q? 
Mike Splinter: No, the way I would look at it, we always pull in, so Idon't know what that means other than nothing out of the ordinary in my view. Ithink it's really more of a function of the outlook that we have for the earlypart of '08 and how that trickles over from the silicon equipment side into theservices side.
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: Got you. And then I guess on the display and solar front youmoved a number of employees from AKT over to solar and now we're staring atprobably at least a two year up cycle for display, so I guess my question hereis: do you have the wherewithal to service both clientele? And: can you commenton what impact it will have in terms of a ramp in both segments? Will have onyour OpEx structure?
Mike Splinter: Well, I'll take the first part and George can handle thesecond part of the question. What we're doing here is basically the displaydivision is supplying a couple pieces of equipment to the solar division. Sothey're staying very focused on developing their supply chain, but we got greatsuppliers in this space. We know how to ramp this. We've been thinking about itfor some time and being prepared here. I don't have any worries about beingable to supply the capacity. Almost whatever, we think it could be in solarplus display. And part of the strength of this is that we not only move someemployees from AKT, we moved a lot of employees from around the company to beable to help solar become a real company and grow fast. That's one of thebenefits and strengths of Applied Materials.
George Davis: And in terms of the OpEx, we do see the OpEx continuing toexpand. This is obviously the critical execution phase, so we'll continue tobuild our capability globally to support that. But what you're seeing is inboth the underlying web and glass businesses that have been in that segment forthe last year and then the addition of our precision wafering capabilitythrough HCT acquisition, you're going to see more revenue along with again asMike talked about the increasing traction on the ATON tool in crystallinesilicon you'll see more revenue helping to fund some of that activity wellwithin its own segment. 
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: Got you, and last question for me: Can you give a sense ofthe magnitude of that large order that came in the last month of the quarter?Is it 100-200? Just give us a sense.
George Davis: The way I would describe it is that it certainly explainsthe differences that you might see comparing quarter-to-quarter differencesbetween us and the industry.
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho withStifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks a lot. A couple of questions: First, and I think it'sclear that you're going to see some initial margin pressures in the solarbusiness as you ramp up over the next 12 months to 18 months, but: what can youdo in your other businesses in terms of their respective margin profile to sortof offset some of the ramp up costs associated with solar? 
George Davis: Well, I think you've already seen that this year. We've donea lot of things to take a hard look at our portfolio across the company, but,again, each business has their own business model that they're going to operateto. We've talked about the Silicon Systems Group coming together and part ofthat is quite frankly, because we saw efficiencies that we could gain while atthe same time improving their competitiveness. So, the only problem I have,your question sort of structures the position of are we going to in some waydamage or under invest in our other businesses, while we rollout the solarbusiness, and we have to compete fiercely in all of our segments and we'llinvest fully in those. But we're going to look to make sure that we're asproductive and efficient as we can, because we do know that the business modelis going to be tested a little bit during this build out and we want to makesure that we manage that carefully.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Yes, I don't think, I wanted to say that you were going tobe under pressure as a whole company. I am just wondering, you have made a lotof improvements. Can there be continued improvements that I guess help offsetany of the initial pressures you'll see in the solar ramp? Because it soundslike you guys have plans in place to do that.
George Davis: No, I think we do and we've talked about some of the biggerones before, but we're really under-penetrated in terms of our global supplychain and particularly in lower cost regions. That will have a big impact overtime on a company and that's quite frankly one of the things that Tom and histeam are very focused on in the silicon segment. We're investing this year and it will continue into nextyear into improving our systems infrastructure, which will also make us moreefficient on all of our businesses, but also allow us to bring in newbusinesses a lot more effectively. So, we're looking at a lot of things alongthose lines. We've got kind of a continuous improvement road map.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Great! Mike, this question is maybe more for you: Youexpressed that there's this cautious sentiment from chip makers right nowthat's obviously looking out into 2008. Are there any near term events, say like the holiday seasonsell-through and the outcome of that, that could change the sentiment over thenext two to three months that may make either the outlook better or worse? 
Mike Splinter: Sure. Absolutely! Depending on how things go over theholiday period through Chinese New Year, it will especially dictate what or howaggressive the flash and foundry guys are going to be. Computer sales have beenokay this year, so that's kind of a positive. And frankly, if you watch thenews of the last couple of days, Wal-Mart and Macy's both have positive retailnumbers, which I think, kind of, surprised everybody. Maybe it's a trend and ifit is, I think, we could see some positives going into the first part of theyear. I just think, we got to stay calm and watch everything and then insideour company we have to do all of those things to execute cost control, longterm and short term. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Great! And then final question for George, just twofinancial questions: You mentioned a one-time charge in the cost to goods lineand facility closures. Do you have that number? And: what was the total dollarsof stock options expensing? 
George Davis: Total dollars for stock option expensing I believe was about33, I think it's about 33 but we can verify that for you. And then on the asset,the combination of asset impairment and facility closure was about a $24million impact.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: And: that was all in cost to goods?
George Davis: Yes.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Great! Thanks a lot, guys.  
George Davis: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Hodess withMerrill Lynch.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon. Mike, you mentioned that you thought yourSilicon Systems performance in the coming year would be similar relative to themarket versus last year, so if the market is down 5 to 15 this year, you wereup 10 versus six or so as you said. Would that mean that your silicon systemsbusiness might be between say, flat and down 10? Or: something like that giventhe range? 
Mike Splinter: Yes, I'm really not prepared to quite give you a range,because I don't know exactly where the wafer fab equipment’s spending is goingto end up, but I think if we take that variable out, we should be plus three orfour to the market. 
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then a quick follow-on: If you look at the logicside of the business in aggregate, so foundry, IDM's and micro processors, theyhaven’t really grown in the last four or five years on CapEx. It's been sort ofstable to slightly down actually, yet they've grown their capacity pretty well.So: do you think that they've changed their productivity capabilities if youwill relative to the memory side of the market and that continues goingforward?
Mike Splinter: Well, companies like ours and our competitors are deliveringa lot of productivity to the customer base, and almost any of our machines, thenumber of wafers that go through it today is substantially more than what wentthrough five years ago. So, that's a big part of it and then there's Moore'sLaw which is another big part of it. And then there's the third factor ofwhat's really driving the leading edge of the technology and how vast areproducts moving on to the end generation of technology and we're seeing that goslower than in the past. So, that ramp gets spread out a little longer, givesthem more time to get more productivity improvement in that ramp. And I thinkthat's why we're largely seeing their CapEx be able to stay pretty stableversus their overall business continues to grow between 5% and 10%.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jesse Pichel withPiper Jaffrey. 
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon. I'm sorry if I missed this, but: when can solarequipment sales start to get recognized as revenue?
George Davis: Yes, I answered that earlier, but it was first for revenuewe believe the earliest will be at the end of our fiscal year and the both ofthe revenue recognition would be in the first half of FY '09.
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: '09.
George Davis: As it relates to the contracts that we've announced.
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: HCT had about a 15-month lead-time on equipment prior toyour acquisition. Have you sought to reduce that lead-time and what is ittoday?
George Davis: Sure. I don't have a specific lead-time number for you today,but it is continuing to improve. We're working very closely with the managementteam there. This is an area obviously where we can help with our manufacturingexpertise. So, we expect to reduce that significantly throughout the year.
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: And: could you shed some light on Flextronics or you're notable to talk about that at this time?
George Davis: No, It’s an investment from our venture fund. That's it.
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: Okay, and my last question is: AMAT carries some significantpolitical might there in the West Coast and I'm wondering if AMAT has aposition there on supporting potential U.S. legislation and given that thepotential positive solar provisions within the Energy Bill are at risk atcurrent? Thank you.
Mike Splinter: Yes. I don't know how much political might we have, butwe've certainly been weighing in on this on the Energy Bill for some time asyou know, we all expected a good Energy Bill to be passed some time in lateJune or early July. It hasn't happened. I have confidence though that ourlegislators are going to pass an Energy Bill that's meaningful and in anenvironment with $100 of oil per barrel, it's hard to imagine that they canpass an Energy Bill without clean energy and renewable energy as a major partof it. I believe people do support the incentive tax credit, butthere's other issues with the Bill on how to pay for those and they have towork through those issues, but I think in the end, they have to find a way todo the right thing for the country. Today, the U.S.isn't much of a market for solar. Most of the solar installations are in Europeexpanding in Chinaand India. TheU.S. few roof tops, but roof tops never going to be, residential roof top isnever going to be a market that is cost effective.
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark FitzGeraldwith Banc of America Securities. 
Mark FitzGerald - Banc of AmericaSecurities: Thank you. Mike, the company has done a great jobdiversifying the product base here. The LED market looks like it should be abig opportunity given your focus on nanotechnology. Any comments there on opportunitiesyou see?
Mike Splinter: Well, we form the Energy And Environmental Solutions businessto really start to take a look at not only creating energy, but saving it andstoring it, so if we could come up with a solution that would help lighting that,that would certainly fit into that group, but other than a desire, we don'thave a product to announce yet, Mark. But it is an important area for us in thefuture.
Mark FitzGerald - Banc of AmericaSecurities: All right, and then just, I guess for George: on the expenseside here, given the near term outlook in semiconductors: can we expect cutscoming in R&D and SG&A from the levels that we're at in the fourthquarter just reported?
Mike Splinter: Yes, we're looking at all areas of spending and making surethat obviously we take care of the critical projects. But yes, we're going tolook, nothing is completely sacred here.
Mark FitzGerald - Banc of AmericaSecurities:
 :
George Davis: Yes, what I said was in our targets for orders, we did notinclude any orders for the SunFab lines. But the right answer is until we havea clear picture that for sure we will see some in the first quarter; we justdidn't feel we could include it.
Mark FitzGerald - Banc of AmericaSecurities: Okay. Thank you.
George Davis: Yes.
Mike Splinter: Thanks Mark.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve O'Rourke withDeutsche Bank.
Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. Mike, you mentioned that your crystalline siliconstrategy in Solar PV is to focus on areas that move the technology forward.What in your view are those areas? You mentioned thinner wafers but what aresome of the others?
Mike Splinter: Well, there are a couple of others. One, which I alsomentioned and that's controlling the passivation layer of backside contact, andone of the key things that when you go into a solar fab often times color gets beamedin 20 different beams, so getting that color uniformity is incredibly importantfor the performance of the line, so those are several of them. How exact, there's a big tradeoff between complexity andefficiency, and this is something that we're fortunate enough to have quite afew people from the industry with great expertise that are really looking atthat area of how do you create the simplest process with the highestefficiency. Most of the turnkey lines today are in the 13% to 15% kind ofefficiency range. You got to do something really special to get up to 20% indesign of the way you make the diodes. So, but that always costs you a lot ofmoney to do that. And so you wouldn't do it unless you're space constrained, sowe have people looking at all those kinds of things that are going to improvethe technology.
Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Fair enough and on the silicon business side, you mentionedthat with the “bottoms up” analysis, it indicates that orders should increasein fiscal 2Q, just preliminarily looking at things? Of that “bottoms up”analysis: how much is memory as a percent?
Mike Splinter: Well, memory is still a big part more than 50% of that. So it'snot like we're going to expect overall memory to drop off gigantically, becausewe think DRAM is going to be down, flash is going to be up. So, it ends up onthat “bottoms up” more than 50%.
Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Were there any cancellations in the quarter?
Mike Splinter: George?
George Davis: Minor.
Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Thank you.
Randy Bane: Operator, we'll take one last question and then make ourclosing remarks.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Steven Pelayo withHSBC.
Stephen Pelayo - HSBC: Great. Just a couple quick ones, George, housekeeping oneshere: I'm impressed with the 27% of revenue, the free cash flow margin there; Ithink it's some of the best numbers Applied has seen. What's your outlook forCapEx and depreciation in '08? And, perhaps more importantly: can you just talka little bit about what's structurally different? It looks like you guys aregenerating cash flow from operations quite better than what you did in 2000 and2001 and it's growing faster than revenue growth for example. What are wethinking, as we look out to '08? And: can we kind of maintain greater than 20%free cash flow margin?
George Davis: Yes, I think that's certainly our objective, and number oneis we're much more asset efficient than we were back then. And as you know we'vebeen reducing our asset footprint for some time even as our revenue has grown,the cycle times and our manufacturing operations are far shorter. So, therequirements, they are less, so we'll continue to -- our working capital management is a realfocus. And so, you've seen inventories come down, so all these things areadding up to better cash flow performance and I think that's the requirementthat we put on the organization. We're going to continue to return cash flow tothe shareholders and at the same time we're going to continue to fully investin the business and if you don't manage cash flow you're just not going to getthere.
Stephen Pelayo - HSBC: And I'm sorry, the outlook for CapEx and depreciation in'08?
George Davis: I would say that we don't see any substantial increase inCapEx required. Most of the CapEx this year has really been around theinvestment in business transformation and some minor lab and other facilitiesfor the solar business, but I don't see any major change from the run ratetoday.
Stephen Pelayo - HSBC: And then the last quick question is just on: the absolutecash balance, $3.7 billion or so. Looks like you've been just returning as apercentage of operating cash flow and still managing to really hold your cashrelatively flattish or so. Do you think, as we look out maybe a year from now,that we won't need to carry this high level -- cash level where we think actualcash balance declines?
George Davis: Sure, we've said that we're comfortable with the cashbalance lower than today's level. Quite frankly, option exercises the lastcouple of quarters has added to the cash portfolio at a fairly substantiallevel, so we'll take that down, that will come down and we don't intend to evenkeep it at this level. So, something around the $3 billion mark is kind ofwhere we said we would like to operate on and we haven't changed our view onthat.
Stephen Pelayo - HSBC: Okay. And I should just apply all of that change in cash andwhatever cash you generate over '08 into buybacks and dividends right?
George Davis: That's right.
Stephen Pelayo - HSBC: Thank you.
Randy Bane: Okay.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to George. George. 
George S. Davis: Thank you, Randy and good afternoon, everyone. I will make a few comments on our overall results for the quarter before discussing our four segments. For the quarter, our results were within the range forecasted for orders and revenue and exceeded our target for earnings per share. Orders came in at the low end of our range as the expected slowdown in DRAM orders was compounded by weaker-than-expected orders from foundry and display customers.  The strong financial results were driven by the performance of our silicon systems group, offsetting weakness in display and services. The company also showed strong cash flow and improved balance sheet performance in the quarter.  For the quarter, orders were down 14% both year over year and quarter over quarter. We had expected orders to be down in the range of 10% to 15%. Backlog at the end of Q3 decreased slightly, in line with the book-to-bill ratio. Backlog adjustments for the quarter were positive at $34 million. As a reminder, our backlog does not include solar contracts for thin film production lines.  Revenue was up 1% in Q3 compared to both last quarter and to Q3 of last year. Gross margin increased 2.6 points to 47.5% in Q3. Q2 gross margin included charges of $50 million, about 2 points, related to our decision to cease development of beamline implant products.  Third quarter operating expenses were essentially flat with Q2.  Headcount at the end of Q3 was 14,465 employees. EPS of $0.34 per share was $0.02 above our target range and was an increase both quarter over quarter and year over year. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.37 per share was also an increase quarter over quarter and year over year. Non-GAAP adjustments are detailed in the press release.  Now I will discuss our segment results. Mike will provide further comments on the industry conditions impacting the segments in a few minutes.  The Silicon Systems segment includes our semiconductor capital equipment in etch, front-end, thin film, CMP, and inspection. Q3 orders were down 17% from Q2 levels as DRAM customers lowered their capacity additions in line with expectations, while foundry customers order at below anticipated levels. NAND Flash orders increased at expected levels and logic customers maintained their order pattern for the year.  In Q3, memory accounted for 74% of orders. Our order composition was: DRAM, 42%; flash memory, 32%; logic and other, 20%; and foundries at 6%. Orders for 65-nanometer and below technology represented 58% of silicon orders.  Silicon net sales were up 2% versus Q2 and up 8% year over year, reflecting continued strength in memory. Foundry spending during the quarter was also up in contrast to order activity.  Operating income increased to just under 40% of revenue due to higher gross margin performance, strong flow-through from higher revenue levels, and product mix.  In silicon, we remain focused on our long-term programs to improve cost efficiency in manufacturing through merchant transit and global low-cost sourcing. Our recent change to a consolidated silicon systems group is expected to provide a better structure for delivering these key benefits.  Our fab solution segment consists of the services business that delivers products to improve the operating efficiency of our customers’ factories and includes spares and refurbished equipment sales.  Fab solution orders declined 6% from Q2 as logic and foundry utilization did not increase at the anticipated rate. Sales increased 2% over Q2 due to higher software revenue, partially offset by lower spare sales. Sales decreased 8% year over year due to lower sales of re-manufactured equipment.  Operating income was slightly lower than Q2 due to product mix and increased operating expenses associated with the Brooks Software business. Fab solutions remains heavily influenced by wafer starts and fab utilization, which has impacted growth this year as we have experienced a longer trough in utilization than expected at the start of 2007. We have also recently seen certain customers reducing spares purchases as part of their own internal cost reduction initiatives.  The display segment includes products and services for manufacturing flat panel displays. Display also manufactures the larger area deposition tools used in thin film solar lines. We had expected to see a recovery in flat panel display orders this quarter; however, customers have not yet resumed their capacity expansion plans. Display orders were $90 million, up modestly from Q2 but down 61% from Q3 of last year. Display revenue was up 2% from Q2 as we continued to benefit from the robust orders from last year.  Operating income increased to 25.2% of revenue from the trough experienced in Q2. Cost reduction measures and product mix changes accounted for the bulk of the operating improvement.  The adjacent technologies segment includes products and services for manufacturing solar cells, high throughput, roll-to-roll coding systems for flexible electronics, and tools for energy efficient glass.  Orders were down $10 million from Q2 and sales were down $14 million from Q2, reflecting the volatile order and revenue dynamics of the industrial glass and web businesses. The operating loss for adjacent technologies was $29 million, due to lower revenue and increased R&D investment to support our solar entry.  Solar activity remains high with the announcement of three more contracts for thin film solar production lines and the announcement of the agreement to acquire HCT shaping systems.  Our solar contracts now exceed the $400 million goal that we set at the end of Q2.  Corporate and unallocated expenses of $189 million were up 17% over the previous quarter, due to the absence of certain favorable one-time benefits in Q2 and increased spending on variable compensation and corporate R&D programs. Spending in this category was down 3% year over year.  Next I will discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to have strong cash flow performance generating $638 million in cash from operations, which represented 25% of revenue. Free cash flow in Q3 was $565 million, or 22% of revenue, up from 17% in Q2. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.  Working capital performance benefited from a decrease in inventory of $109 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $73 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $63 million.  During Q3, Applied returned $483 million, or 76%, of operating cash flow to its stockholders. Of that total, $400 million was for share repurchases that retired 20.1 million shares at an average price of $19.91; and $83 million was used for dividends.  We remain committed to generating strong cash flows, managing the balance sheet to maximize asset utilization, and returning capital to our stockholders. Since the beginning of 2006, we have returned $5.6 billion to stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends.  We provided these cash returns while maintaining our R&D investment on pace with the highest levels in our history.  Cash and investments at quarter end grew by $390 million to $3.76 billion, from $3.37 billion in the previous quarter. Net cash proceeds related to employee stock option exercises was approximately $270 million during the quarter.  In Q4, we anticipate larger-than-usual cash outlays, including $475 million for the pending HCT acquisition and $200 million for scheduled debt retirement.  Additionally, we intend to make stock repurchases of between $300 million to $400 million.  In summary, Q3 was a strong quarter financially and operationally for the company, despite a soft order environment. Now I will turn the call over to Mike Splinter to provide the CEO’s perspective on key things for the quarter and on the industry environment. Mike. 
Michael R. Splinter: Thanks, George. Good afternoon and thanks all of you for joining us today. As you know, Applied’s strategy is to utilize nano-manufacturing technology to solve key technical challenges, drive higher returns for our customers, and accelerate growth in new markets.  As George summarized, memory stood out as the driver of our business this quarter, while foundry orders were weaker than expected. Service and display were essentially flat. At the same time, demand for solar is growing and we are building the capabilities to be the solar technology leader.  Our results this quarter illustrate our ability to execute in a changing environment and adapt quickly to the needs of our customers. Thanks to the many talented people we have at Applied, we have made significant achievements during the quarter and this year.  Recently, we created the silicon systems group under the leadership of Tom St. Dennis, a strategic move which consolidates our semiconductor equipment divisions in one organization to extend our leadership in innovation, improved customer satisfaction, and operational efficiencies.  Our customers are facing increased process complexities and shortened product lifecycles, resulting in higher R&D costs to introduce the next technology node. Applied is leading by delivering innovative technical solutions, such as high-K metal gate and double patterning. In etch, we have been extending our position in memory, advancing particularly in metal and silicon etch. We released the Carina Etch system for high-K metal gate and made our first customer shipments during the quarter.  We are addressing our customers’ need to improve their product costs with higher productivity tools. One example of the importance of improved productivity is the unprecedented demand for our producer GT system. Just nine months after launch, we shipped our 100th system, demonstrating one of the fastest ramps of any new product in the industry.  In addition, our Sokudo joint venture has begun shipments of an upgraded track system, focused on the leading edge immersion lithography applications. This system leads the industry in enhanced defect and critical dimension control that are so important for the next generation of ICs.  In fab solutions, we are enabling customer success through superior service solutions. We are transforming our service business with a suite of new products that improve the efficiency and lessen the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing. Since opening in June, our wafer reclaim center in Taiwan has already processed more than 8,500 wafers using its patented process and is qualifying five new customers this quarter.  In the display area, growth in sales of LCD TVs was significant in the first half of 2007, up 65% year over year. Despite this fact, we expect capital spending by display manufacturers to be down 30% to 40% this year. Our expansion into new product lines and share gains in existing products will help our results as display orders start to improve in Q4. However, long lead times in this business will not result in revenue improvement until the second half of fiscal ’08.  On a positive note, we are excited to see a leading panel maker announce its intention to move to gen 10, the next larger glass size.  In adjacent technologies, Applied Materials is leading the drive to create new solutions to generate and conserve energy, with a focus on lowering the cost of producing solar electricity. Our thin film technology is gaining broad acceptance and we recently started shipping equipment for our first thin film solar production line. Meanwhile, we signed an agreement to acquire HCT Shaping Systems to broaden our capabilities in the fast-growing crystalline solar cell technology arena. We expect this acquisition to close within the next 30 days.  With solutions for both crystalline and thin film, we are rapidly becoming the technology leader in solar.  Our confidence in our core business and new markets is underscored by three factors: our new products are focused on customers’ key technical challenges in growing markets; our initiatives on cost and performance are advancing; and finally, we have the technical talent and global organization to achieve our vision.  With that said, I would like to share our view of the market environment.  In the memory market, bit growth is well ahead of expectations and despite dramatic price reductions in both NAND Flash and DRAM during the first half of the year, customers still have the confidence to invest in advanced capacity to lower process costs and enable higher density devices. End unit demand is strengthening, not only due to seasonality but also new applications. Products like the iPhone will require far more flash memory per unit to accommodate the rich content people desire.  We are also well on the way to seeing flash incorporated into hard drives for faster boot-up, and ultimately solid-state drives for greater mobility and longer battery life. Flash memory is now leading the technology evolution and becoming increasingly important to our new product development.  DRAM pricing is improving in recent weeks as excess capacity is being consumed. Cell phones and PCs are creating robust bit growth ahead of forecast. The adoption of the Microsoft Vista operating system began this year with consumers. Corporate adoption won’t be significant until next year and will continue into 2009, further expanding DRAM bit growth.  The foundries are reporting record sales with positive momentum expected to continue into the fourth quarter. Industry consolidation and R&D favors the foundry model. Utilization at foundries is moving into the 90% range, indicating the need to add capacity. However, little capacity has been added this year as customers have stretched their existing lines and the 65-nanometer ramp is taking longer to develop than we had anticipated.  Overall, our view is that equipment spending will be slightly lower in the second half of the calendar year, primarily due to foundry spending not materializing. While foundry remains weak, we expect memory capital investment to remain relatively strong and logic to be flat.  Flat revenue in the fab solutions market reflects lower-than-expected utilization in logic and foundry as well as lower remanufactured equipment sales. These elements have slowed our growth in AGS but with new products an increased focus in Asia, we expect a return to growth in the upcoming quarters.  Our solar customers are increasingly more confident that thin film technology is the lowest cost per watt solution and has a major role in the solar technology landscape. The number of thin film production line contracts continues to increase. Therefore, we are raising our 2007 goal from greater than $400 million to greater then $600 million.  In closing, Applied Materials is well prepared for the growing opportunities ahead. We are building share in the new critical applications and semiconductors, gaining traction on our new service products, navigating through an investment downturn in display, and increasing our product offering and penetrating the fast growing solar market.  Thank you very much. Now I will hand the call back to George for some commentary on our targets. Then we’ll be pleased to answer any of your questions. George. 
George S. Davis: Thank you, Mike. With the industry dynamics that Mike just summarized as the foundation, here are the targets for Applied’s fourth quarter: we expect orders to be in the range of flat to down 5%, with reductions in silicon orders partially offset by improved orders in display and fab solutions; we expect revenue to be down in the range of 5% to 10% with lower revenue predominantly from DRAM and foundry customers partially offset by increases in fab solutions; we expect EPS to be down in line with revenue and in the range of $0.26 to $0.29.  Randy, let’s now open the call for questions. 
Randy Bane: Operator, let’s please begin with the first question. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. 
Stephen Chin - UBS: Thank you. On the order guidance, how should we think about the silicon business unit? Do you get the sense that the silicon business unit orders will trough here in the October quarter? And then just as a follow-up to that, how sustainable do you think this 39% operating margin level in the silicon business is going forward, especially since you’ve created this new silicon systems group? 
Michael R. Splinter: Maybe I can answer the first part of the question, Stephen, and let George answer the second part of it.  I really think the question gets down to what is going to happen in foundries and we are really not going to know that until maybe October. We see this quarter being certainly weaker than we anticipated but we see DRAM and flash continuing their strength with confidence by those manufacturers to continue their investments, particularly because of strong unit demand and strong bit growth. George. 
George S. Davis: On the gross margin end, obviously they had a very big pick-up quarter over quarter. We would expect that they are going to continue to drive improvements in operating profit. I think you have some mix issues that assisted in Q3 that you can’t always rely on being there in out quarters, but we certainly expect that through the combination we are going to improve both gross margin and operating margin. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thanks for taking my question. In your October guidance, you mentioned earlier in the call that the HCT acquisition closes in a month. How much of HCT is baked into your revenues and orders in October? 
George S. Davis: None. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay, and secondly, when you talk about bookings down about, flat to down 5%, how much is memory bookings down do you think for your from peak to trough within that guidance in October? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, as you know, DRAM bookings were off in our Q3. They are roughly flat going into Q4. Flash was very high for us in Q3, so it is down a bit but when you look at our overall bookings, we expect memory to be in the range that it’s been in in the last few quarters. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: A quick follow-up; on your solar contracts, now that they are tracking above expectations, can you remind us where we are in terms of where we can expect these contracts, when we can expect these contracts to flow into bookings and revenues? Thanks. 
George S. Davis: Sure. We expect to begin booking these contracts in the first half of ’08 and the first revenue should come in at the tail end of ’08. 
Randy Bane: Okay, next question, please. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Edward White with Lehman Brothers. 
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Thanks. You mentioned that the foundries had lower bookings, revenues increased, and they are basically extending their fabs, getting more productivity out of the fabs. How far do you think they can take that? At what point do you think they really have to come back in and start investing more? 
Michael R. Splinter: We really thought it would be by this time but if we really look year over year, the utilization is down. When they started ordering last year, their utilization was in the mid-90s. They haven’t quite reached the mid-90s yet but with utilization continuing to move in a positive direction, we think that should be shortly. But right now our projection is for very low revenue in Q4 from foundries. 
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and then secondly, if the flat panel display related to orders pick up in the fourth quarter, what do you think would be the driver behind that? Can you give us some color as to what is causing the inflection point there as you go forward? 
Michael R. Splinter: We’ve seen a very positive growth in LCD TV sales. Prices have been coming down pretty dramatically in the first half of the year. Volume pick-up, 65%, that absorbed a lot of the capacity, and as long as consumer spending stays strong during the second half of the year, we think that companies are going to reinvest. People have held back on gen 8.5. Now we see one of the major manufacturers going and talking about gen 10, so there starts to be a pretty big spread from the leading manufacturers to the trailing manufacturers.  I think really it gets down to the growth in the LCD TV sales. 
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks a lot. Just a quick question first for George; in terms of the $19 million in the items associated with acquisition, is that all in G&A or is there any in cost of goods? 
George S. Davis: That should all be mostly in G&A. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Mostly in G&A, okay, great. And a question for you, Mike, and just following up Ed’s question about the foundries, in terms of the 65-nanometer adoption, what do you think is causing I guess the delays or the slower-than-expected adoption of that technology node? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, we think it is really cost crossover. Those products that absolutely need 65-nanometers are already on 65-nanometer. I think the bulk of the customers are waiting to see that they are going to get a cost savings by moving to 65-nanometers or other kinds of performance benefits, but I think that is the big thing -- are yields high enough, are production costs low enough to drive the bulk of the products over to 65-nanometer. We think that there are plenty of products that are now getting qualified on 65. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with Morgan Stanley. 
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Thank you and good afternoon. Mike, with a good portion of the installed NAND memory capacity at 200-millimeters, and with the roadmap for flash going to sub 65 next year, are more of your NAND customers now positioning to transition to 300-millimeter in a more accelerated manner than your prior views? 
Michael R. Splinter: You can already hear a number of companies talking about dispositioning their 200-millimeter capacity. Our view is that over the next couple of years, there needs to be about 200,000 equivalent 300-millimeter wafers created to replace those aging 200-millimeter factories where they are really not going to be cost competitive. That’s the real issue, is as prices come down and 300-millimeter density goes up, the 200-millimeter products really are not -- 200-millimeter fabs are not competitive any longer. So I think we are going to seen an increased movement next year and into 2009. 
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great, and then a question for George; great job on the margins. As it relates to the gross margin improvement, how much of that was a richer mix because of equipment sales for sub-90-nanometer technologies, where you have higher ASPs? 
George S. Davis: I would say in general, I can’t be that specific but the silicon group really drove the improvement in gross margin and obviously you had in Q2 about two points of gross margin impact, but even if you take that out, margin was up quarter over quarter, despite the softness in some of our other segments. So it was really an outstanding performance by the silicon systems group. 
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh with CIBC World Markets. 
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Thanks for taking my question. My question relates to your fab solutions business. Specifically, George, since that business is starting to pick back up, if I look at fab solutions over the last three quarters, it seems on higher revenue you are seeing a little bit of operating margin compression. Can you walk me through what kind of mix issues might have been affecting that or influencing that, and sort of what to expect in terms of operating margins if fab solutions starts picking up? Is there any kind of step function to the upside here since we’ve seen such a gradual decline in operating margins there? 
George S. Davis: Good question. What you are really seeing just between quarters has really been the addition of operating expenses as we take in the Brooks Software division into the group. We have pretty flat revenue and so I would say the margin erosion that we’ve seen is really some of the drivers that we’ve talked about, where we’ve seen both refurb and spares softer than expected, which has brought down the operating margin.  I think as you see the refurb markets and the spares group picking back up, then that will have some leverage into margin. But again, they’ve been -- if you look out over time, they’ve been having an operating margin somewhere between 25 and the high 20s, and they are certainly at the low-end of that, but even as recently as Q1 they were at about 28%, so I think you are just seeing some softness based on the factors we were talking about. 
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: If I could ask just one quick follow-up here for Mike, Mike, you mentioned Sharp and their gen 10 project and it seems like they are the first customer that’s potentially running both LCD, panels, and thin film solar panels together to sort of balance out utilization rates. Is that true and is that a trend we could see with other higher gen flat panel manufacturers? 
Michael R. Splinter: I don’t think we’re quite sure about the architecture of their line right now and how that is going to really be created but obviously the most expensive pieces of equipment are common between flat panels and thin film solar cells, so it can give them an opportunity to improve their overall factory utilization but we have to have a lot more discussions before we clearly understand how they are going to architect that factory. 
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup. 
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: A couple of things; Mike, you mentioned that you think that about, you have to replace about 200,000 300-millimeter equivalents in NAND. It sounds like that’s about $9 billion that has to be spent. Is it reasonable A, that that’s spent maybe over the next two years? And do you have an estimate for what might have to be spent in DRAM to replace all that 8-inch capacity? 
Michael R. Splinter: Roughly, your numbers are very close to ours, 200,000 300-millimeter equivalents over the next two years. It’s difficult to tell exactly how that is going to go. It will depend on the market but we certainly think by the end of 2009 those have to be replaced.  We think that there is something not maybe as big as 200,000 for DRAM, but a significant amount of capacity that has to be replaced for DRAM as well. 
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay, and then Mike, you are keying a pick-up in bookings to the foundry business. I guess as you look at what has gone on in foundries, foundries are at record sales, as you’ve cited. They seem to have utilizations increase. Obviously you have very big exposure there as well and yet you are booking close to record lows out of those customers, so do you think that there is something structural actually going on there? I know that they are trying to extend their factories but it seems like maybe there’s some kind of a mix shift going on with respect to their customer base that just makes them not have to spend as much money. 
Michael R. Splinter: There’s a couple of things going on. One is they are extending their utilization further up before they start buying capacity. If you look over the last couple of generations, it’s gone from 85% to 90% to 95% and it’s getting I think now maybe close to 100% utilization before they add capacity.  The other thing is just the growth of the 65-nanometer node is not as fast as we thought it would be, relative to the number of products we’ve seen get qualified on 65-nanometer. So I think those two are structural changes that we are seeing but we’ve also seen that when we look at CapEx per revenue of the foundries, it’s been dropping for a few years, leveling off something around 10% but that seems really quite low for a very capital intensive sort of company. So we are still thinking that the orders have to come back relatively soon and as 65-nanometer ramps in a major way, it should be a fairly substantial order pattern from foundries. 
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark FitzGerald from Banc of America Securities. 
Mark FitzGerald - Banc of America Securities: Thank you. On the gen 10 equipment, can you give us some idea when that’s going to be ready to ship at this point? And as it pertains to the solar market, how important in terms of opening up building integrated photovoltaics is the gen 10? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, we think the gen 10 will ship sometime late fiscal year next year. As far as building integrated photovoltaics, obviously even with gen 8.5 you can do it but architectural glass is kind of in the 3 to 3.2 meter range. Gen 10, or a modified gen 10, should be able to handle that, so that is an area that we are quite excited about and as we design our gen 10 platform, we are going to make sure that it can handle the largest sizes of architectural glass. 
Mark FitzGerald - Banc of America Securities: Just a quick follow-on; can you give us some idea what the spares and service in the solar business mean in terms of a revenue opportunity? Is it the same level as semiconductor? Is it above or below? 
George S. Davis: We think it is going to be an attractive business but we are really just in the process of sorting that now with our customers, as we are holding these lines together. We’ll cover that in some detail at the analyst meeting in January. We are going to try and give you a more comprehensive look because we will be well into these first contracts by then. 
Mark FitzGerald - Banc of America Securities: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Dana with J.P. Morgan. 
Jay Dana - J.P. Morgan: Hi, it’s [Betty] for Jay Dana. It seems like you have a lot of moving parts to your gross margin -- 
Michael R. Splinter: We’re having a very hard time hearing you. Maybe you could get closer to the microphone. 
Jay Dana - J.P. Morgan: I’m sorry. Could you give us some gross margin guidance in 2008 with all the moving parts, your HCT acquisition, your ramp of solar deliveries -- where should we be modeling corporate gross margins in 2008? 
George S. Davis: We are not going to give any guidance yet for ’08 but we can just generally, the acquisition picture, HCT, won’t have a material impact on gross margins in ’08 and each of the groups I think has a -- there’s no fundamental deterioration in the gross margin outlook, so I think you can kind of model off of today and then just make some assumptions for improvement that we, you know, just general improvement over time, particularly in the silicon systems group. 
Jay Dana - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. And then, for foundries, if they do come back and order in October, is that in your guidance or is that upside to your guidance? 
Michael R. Splinter: Our guidance has very low orders for foundries in our Q4. 
Jay Dana - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven O’Rourke with Deutsche Bank. 
Steven O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, I hate to beat a dead horse but are the foundries telling you anything different now than they told you three months ago? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, if you look at our revenue in Q3, we had an up-tick in foundry orders that we delivered in the quarter, had some good turns business, and so we -- three months ago we kind of expected that trend to continue throughout the year and it’s not. And so yes, there is a fairly substantial difference between now and May. 
Steven O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and of all the solar PV amorphous silicon lines that you’ve signed to date, how many are dual junction? 
Michael R. Splinter: Really only one dual junction contract so far, but one of the interesting things about our single junction line is that it is always possible to upgrade those in the future. 
George S. Davis: And obviously certain customers are looking at that as an option as they think about their expansion plans. 
Steven O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Fair enough. And is it safe to assume that the start-up of that dual junction line is well out into fiscal ’08? 
Michael R. Splinter: Yes. 
Steven O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Pelayo with HSBC. 
Steven Pelayo - HSBC Equity Research: A question for each of you guys; George, bookings and backlog, looking going forward here, specifically kind of timing and magnitude. You’ve got solar coming out in the first half of ’08. I don’t know if that was fiscal or calendar, if you can comment on that. You’ve got some service contract renewals that are going to be coming here. HCT being added in, and then you’ve even got foundry at a record level and bouncing off the bottom -- it seems like you guys have a fair amount of cushion, if you will, looking forward. Could you comment a little bit on timings of how we add in some of those solar and service contract renewals and HCT impacts?  And the Mike, do you think these cushions can allow October bookings to actually be a quarterly trough? 
George S. Davis: Let me start with the -- again, for the thin film solar lines, and let me start to differentiate now because obviously HCT will have a different backlog picture than that. We believe that we will start booking these things sometime in the first half of ’08, fiscal or calendar, it’s pretty close so I won’t differentiate too much there. I think I would put it safely in the latter half of fiscal, or the latter part of the first half of fiscal ’08, if that’s not too confusing.  On HCT, we would obviously -- we’ll take their backlog in when the deal closes, which we hope will be within the next 30 days. 
Michael R. Splinter: Steven, as far as Q4 being a quarterly trough, I think the real question again will be how sell-through goes, back to school, and holidays. Our checks in Taiwan are pretty positive so far on computer builds and other consumer products for the latter half of the year. I think those things are going a little bit better than normal seasonality, so we are starting out okay. But again, it is going to be whether our customers have confidence to invest going into 2008. At this point, we think they should but I don’t think they are going to decide even until October. 
Steven Pelayo - HSBC Equity Research: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Maire with Needham & Company. 
Michael R. Splinter: Robert, are you there? 
Operator: Mr. Maire has withdrawn his question. Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Freedman Billings and Ramsay. 
Mehdi Hosseini - Freedman Billings & Ramsay: Thank you for taking my question. A question for George and one for Mike. Given the restructuring that is going on in the silicon business, how many -- what will be the impact on the operating costs, especially on the SG&A? I imagine there will be some headcount reduction.  And then for -- moving on to the solar side, from what I understand some of your customers are actually going to be installing thin film and these panels beginning in the first quarter of 2008, so help me understand how these bookings and revenue recognition is going to play out. What are the factors that determine the actual recognition as these panels are installed?  And just, if I may squeeze in one more question -- you are talking about 65-nanometer ramp is lower than expected but at the same time, we are hearing that a lot of activity regarding the take-outs for 45-nanometer. Will there be a situation where some of these high-end customers actually are skipping from 65-nanometer and jumping on to 45? 
George S. Davis: I’ll go first then on the question on the silicon systems cost savings. Again, the group was just formed so Tom and his team are looking at what are the opportunities? Clearly we think that there is a chance to, like I said, to have savings both in the gross margin line and on the SG&A line. We are also -- there’s a real focus on asset efficiency. Part of the organizational change was to have under one point of accountability not only the product business groups but the manufacturing and the global supply chain.  One of the first things that we did as the group was formed was to challenge them to address what we believe to be some excess inventory that had built in the system, and as you can see in the quarter, we were very pleased that they were able to really have an impact on that inventory.  So I am confident we are going to see cost-savings. I am confident that we are also going to see some other operational improvements in addition to the benefits that we believe it will provide to our customers in terms of both the customer service but also our innovation.  So with that, I would just say we’ll probably have a better feel as Tom and his team finish their work on this and we can probably talk about it a little bit more certainly by the analyst meeting but maybe even by next quarter. 
Michael R. Splinter: Hey, George, you want to talk about how we are recognizing revenue in the solar contracts? 
George S. Davis: Sure. We’ll be recognizing revenue obviously when HCT closes -- let me just talk about HCT because there’s been some confusion. HCT has an established product so when it comes on, we will go ahead and recognize revenue based on their existing business.  The solar thin film contracts that are all basically right now first of a kind, we will be basically taking revenue as we have sign-off on those, and we would expect that at the -- the first of that at the tail-end of ’08 and the bulk of what we’ve talked about so far, and then of course in the early part of ’09. 
Mehdi Hosseini - Freedman Billings & Ramsay: So when -- 
Michael R. Splinter: As I mentioned that we are shipping the first line, so it will be installed in the first quarter and we have to meet some performance parameters to get those sign-offs, so the machines have to be started up, the line has to run, modules have to be made.  On the 65-nanometer ramp, there is a phenomena going on that some customers are skipping generations of technology because of the cost of redesigning products, the costs of masks, the costs of starting up a new product. This phenomena really started at 130 where customers skipped 130, went to 90, or 130 customers skipped 90 and went to 65.  I’m not sure how much of a major trend this is. I think the trend is already -- so, next question. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch. 
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Mike, your orders were done on the silicon system side about 17% sequentially and you commented on a few product lines, but I was wondering in this softer environment how you see your share holding up on the semiconductor system side? Obviously you mentioned you were gaining, you think you are gaining some share on memory etch but I was wondering if you could talk overall on that side. 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, our trend maybe in a couple of directions and then a couple of specifics, Brett. In memory, we continued to gain share. It’s been a focus of ours for the last several years, especially since the NAND Flash is really the technology leader now. The leading edge capabilities have to be brought up on NAND Flash. We’ve been doing a lot of work on leading edge capabilities there.  You can see that pretty much in how much our booking has gone towards flash memory. I think if you would have thought back a couple of years ago, our percentage of flash memory, or memory of our total would not be nearly as great.  As we go through the nodes, we continue to gain share as well. You know, from our share standpoint, it is one or two points in each one of the subsequent generations. Now, where is the share coming from? The share is really coming from some of the areas where our share is lower. In etch, we are moving ahead, particularly in silicon and metal etch this year. We feel like we have a strong set of products there.  In EPI, EPI has been adopted by memory manufacturers, by DRAM memory manufacturers, growing that market dramatically and our share there has grown as well. We see that as an evolving story over the next year, few years.  Our inspection is growing. U-Vision now has got seven repeat customers that we are taking share at, so we are excited about our other new products in inspection as well.  And then in our major areas, we feel like we are holding share at a very high level and the other stronghold areas that we’ve traditionally had. 
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Gavin Duffy with A.G. Edwards. 
Gavin Duffy - A.G. Edwards: Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Just quickly, George, what are we assuming for the tax rate next quarter? 
George S. Davis: Pretty much flat, 31% to 32%. 
Gavin Duffy - A.G. Edwards: And Mike, maybe kind of more of a concept question. You talked about DRAM next year with corporate adoption of Vista. How would you see DRAM maybe playing out over next year? Will there be more, like, kind of a first half event like this year or could it be kind of a longer tail? 
Michael R. Splinter: My thinking now is it is going to be a longer tail because Vista adoption in corporate is really going to start in earnest I think by the middle of next year and then extend for at least a year. Most corporations are not going to do Vista until it is well-established and it is really the reliable capability they need, so I don’t think that is going to start until mid-year. It is going to drive an awful lot of DRAM for corporate capability because of the experience that corporate users want. 
Gavin Duffy - A.G. Edwards: If I can ask one last one, talking about utilization rates increasing at the foundries, and also record revenues. How much of this would be end market demand increasing versus you see this migration of customers towards fab-less or fab-light models where you essentially have a wash in terms of the foundries buying equipment instead of these guys? Do you think it is more end user demand helping out? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, some of both. Clearly our view is that the current environment and costs of R&D, cost of factories favor the foundry model so over a period of time, we saw a pretty big rush this year with a number of companies announcing that they won’t do new semiconductor factories. They will move to a foundry model of one type or the other.  But I think in the overall run, it is going to be consumer devices growing the demand and also a substantial portion of the foundry growth from customers moving to that model and away from the traditional IBM model.  It is hard to say a percentage at this point. 
Gavin Duffy - A.G. Edwards: Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks, Mike. 
Operator: Your next question comes from James Covello with Goldman Sachs & Company. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much. Just two quick questions. First, George, if I go from your revenue guidance to your EPS guidance, it implies either a little bit higher op-ex or a little bit lower gross margins. Is it tilted towards one or the other of those? 
George S. Davis: It would be more towards margin on the segment mix. I think what you see is what we’ve said is guidance at -- let’s say 29 to 34, which is the difference there. You’ve got lower revenue accounting for about two-thirds of that and then mix where you have silicon going down, which was very, very strong, and you have we said we think fab solutions and display will be up. So that trade-off is where you get the mix impact. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks. And then the follow-up, Mike, relative to the commentary about memory spending, you talk about the willingness of memory customers continue to spend. Now, there’s been four or five DRAM customers that have come out and given ’08 CapEx guidance that’s been much, much lower than what they’ve spent in ’07, and while four or five is by no means a big enough sample size to draw any kind of conclusions, at least those four or five, which I think represent about 20% or 25% of the memory spending, are suggesting CapEx down between 30% and 50%. Is that being reflected in their current order patterns? Do you think they are just taking a conservative approach? How would you have us think about that? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, a lot of the quarter-to-quarter movement is just timing of investment. I think we’ll have to see how the environment shakes out in the next six months here before we really judge 2008 but one thing when you talk to the memory manufacturers, if there is bit growth, if there is bit demand, they are going to invest the capacity because they know that if they don’t, their share and their position in the market is going to deteriorate relatively rapidly.  You can see that already with how the share has shifted around in the various memory players in the last year or two years, with some people used to have close to 20% now are under 10. They didn’t invest and their share has dramatically dropped off. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: But then again, Mike, specific to the companies that are guiding ’08 CapEx a lot lower, how does that mesh with their need to continue to spend? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, it’s pretty difficult to comment exactly on each one of the three or four companies, but when you look at the major companies who represent the other 80%, I think they are still looking at trying to meet a very aggressive bit demand growth.  Bit demand growth has been so aggressive in this first half this year and I thought it would initially slow down in the second half, and I don’t see it slowing down. 
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jesse Pichel with Piper Jaffray. 
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on guiding up your solar goal to $600 million. Two questions; I’m interested to know if you are accelerating your CIGS development activities, as evidenced by some key hires you’ve made? 
Michael R. Splinter: Well, we are really right now focused on both the crystalline silicon and the thin film silicon approaches. Certainly we think that all different kinds of materials and material modification are going to play into the solar landscape over a period of time and we want -- our goal is to be the technology leader in solar. And in order to do that, we really have to be knowledgeable about and really leading in all the key areas. But to be the technology leader, you have to be the leader that drives down the end cost per watt and we are going to use whatever means that are at our disposal to be able to do that.  But at this moment, we think thin film silicon is the best path to be there. We think for installations where there is limited space, crystalline silicon is the best path to the lowest cost per watt for that kind of application. And there are a lot of other technologies coming on. We are going to be there with those technologies in the markets that they can play in. 
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: Just to refine my question a bit, I was referring to copper indium gallium selenide type of materials. 
Michael R. Splinter: I know what you were referring to. 
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: Okay. All right. And the second question is do you anticipate a solar fab solutions opportunity, perhaps source targets or wire -- 
Michael R. Splinter: We do view that there is an excellent opportunity for fab solutions in the solar market. At this point, it is a little bit too early for us to give you a make-up of that but certainly service bears abatement, consumables of all different kinds can fit into that market and we are exploring all of those. 
Jesse Pichel - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. 
Randy Bane: Operator, we’ll take one more question and make our closing remarks. 
Operator: Your last question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just have an observation/question. It seems like we are in a somewhat unique time here. Following up on an earlier question, it seems like some of the memory companies, [inaudible] and Micron, have cut CapEx but some others, the NAND folks and other Taiwanese folks are hinting at flat. It seems like logic and foundry is down a lot this year and it seems like display is down over 50% the last couple of years.  Going back, to the best of your recollection, do you recollect a time in the past where you have seen such a wide divergence between all the different sectors, where one is at peak, one is at trough? And going forward into ’08, when you look at these end-markets, semi CapEx and display CapEx, ex-solar, what do you see as your available CapEx growth in ’08? 
Michael R. Splinter: I think first of all, there’s different things that are driving the different parts of the market. In memory, I think if we just go to NAND Flash to start with, the ability to have mobile storage and large amounts of mobile storage is driving NAND Flash. I just look at the iPhone with 8-gigs. I can’t imaging that’s going to stay anywhere close to that over any kind of period of time. It is going to ramp dramatically.  Will it have a large impact on overall cell phone sales? I don’t know. I think that it will as more features come in but the much bigger impact will be on NAND Flash because of the increased need for storage in devices that people carry around.  DRAM is still I think, while it’s been increasingly adopted in cell phones, the big driver is still going to be PCs for the next 18 months, so this is a different kind of a cycle and a new operating system drives it up faster than just a simple unit growth.  In other kind of devices that are really affecting foundries, it becomes more just how many units of computers and cell phones are increasing and those markets are increasing more closely to 10% a year. So there are different factors that are driving the different markets and I do think that that’s a fairly major change in our environment that it is not as uniform maybe as it’s been in the past.  Display, I think it is a little bit different in that it is more of the old fashioned, supply-and-demand capacity getting ahead of itself and then having to absorb the capacity with growth in the market.  Overall, when I look at WFE, wafer fab equipment spending for 2007 is kind of up 5%. Applied Materials is going to be up in our silicon systems business about 10%. Overall, this is going to be our best revenue year of all time, so how that is going to extend into 2008 -- if the things that we think are going to happen, we think that the growth is going to be relatively similar to 2007 but boy, it’s way too early to make a solid projection on that. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thank you. 
Randy Bane: Thank you. We would like to thank all of your for joining us on the discussion of Applied Materials' financial results and would like to remind you that a replay of this call and the supporting slide package will be available on our website until 5:00 p.m. today and will remain posted until August 28th.

George Davis: Thank you, Randy. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I will cover Applied's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Our Q1 performance was within the range of our targets. Overall Q1 was a solid quarter for the company and represents one of the strongest first quarters in our history. We continue to execute on the strategies we put in place last year to strengthen our financial and operating performance. I would like to thank our employees for their contributions in making this happen. It is their commitment to delivering results that led to the strong performance.  As you know, we are now reporting our financial results with additional information provided by segment. We're disclosing orders, revenue and operating income for each of our four segments and we will continue to provide quantitative targets at the corporate level for our orders, revenue, and EPS outlook.  Now, let me review our financial performance in more detail. Beginning first, with a summary of total company results, orders totaled $2.54 billion for the quarter, up 24% year-over-year and down 5.6% from the prior quarter. Orders in Q1 reflected record levels for Fab Solutions and an increase in silicon orders which partially offset a significant decline in display orders. Q1 orders included seven orders in excess of 100 million. Backlog for Q1 increased to $3.55 billion, compared to $3.4 billion for Q4. Backlog adjustments totaled $111 million as certain display and silicon customers pushed out shipment dates beyond our 12-month booking window.  Revenue for Q1 was $2.28 billion, representing a 23% increase year-over-year, but 10% lower than last quarter. Silicon, Display and Fab Solutions segments all reported quarter-over-quarter revenue declines with Display the most impacted on a relative basis with a reduction of over 20%.  Gross margin for the first quarter decreased slightly to 46.7% compared to 47.1% for the fourth quarter. The decline in gross margin was due primarily to lower revenue levels and product mix. Equity-based compensation charges of $6 million were included in this quarter's gross margin.  First quarter operating expenses, consisting of RD&E, marketing and selling and G&A were $516 million, 6% lower than Q4. These expense levels reflected savings from cost control initiatives in Q1, our shutdown in December, and lower equity-based compensation cost. Operating income was $550 million or 24.1% of revenue compared to 25.2% reported for the fourth quarter. Net income was $403 million or $0.29 per share compared to $449 million or $0.30 per share for the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP net income was also $0.29 per share as equity compensation expense was partially offset by the positive effects of tax settlements relating to prior year audits. Net interest income for the quarter was $20 million, $8 million lower than the previous quarter as a result of lower average cash balances.  Now I would like to discuss our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and investments increased $199 million to $3.41 billion. The company generated $381 million in cash from operations, partially offset by $132 million paid to settle the price adjustment on the accelerated stock buyback initiated in the fourth quarter and by $70 million paid in dividends.  Free cash flow generation for Q1 was $322 million, down from $600 million in Q4. While Q4 was a particularly strong quarter for free cash flow, Q1 is below our 15% to 20% of revenue trend due to higher working capital balances in response to changing customer requirements experienced during the quarter. We expect to be back within that range over the balance of the year.  During Q1, accounts receivables increased modestly and day sales outstanding grew to 82 days on lower revenue levels and changes in regional mix. Inventory increased by $112 million, principally due to increases in raw materials and work-in-process inventories.  The company completed the accelerated share repurchase in the first fiscal quarter of 2007. Including the affects of the price adjustment taken in Q1, we repurchased 145 million shares under the accelerated stock buyback program at an average price of $18.08 per share. Total share repurchases initiated in Q4 resulted in a 10% reduction in shares outstanding at the beginning of that period. We have a 5 billion three-year share repurchase authorization in place.  In Q2, we plan to reinitiate our share repurchase activity and expect to purchase between 300 million and 400 million in stock. In December, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share.  Capital spending for the quarter was $59 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $61 million. Headcount at the end of Q1 was 14,003 regular full time employees.  Now I would like to discuss our segment results, starting first with silicon. Silicon orders of $1.76 billion were up 5% over Q4. Silicon orders had the following mix: DRAM was 51%, Flash Memory 20%, Logic and other 18%, and foundries 11%. 300 millimeter tools accounted for over 90% of segment orders, virtually all of which were at 100 nanometer and smaller process technology levels. Orders for 65 nanometer and smaller process technology represented over 50% of silicon orders.  Silicon net sales of $1.49 billion were up 22% year-over-year and down 8% from Q4. This reflects continued strength in memory offset by lower spending by foundry and logic customers. Operating income was $520 million or 35% of sales, a decrease of $52 million or 9% from Q4, primarily due to lower revenue and product mix.  Now Fab Solutions. Fab Solution's orders of $686 million were up 13% year-over-year and 10% over Q4, driven by costumer renewals of annual service contracts. Q1 orders were a record for this segment. Fab Solution's net sales of $525 billion were up 12% year-over-year continuing the track record of double-digit growth in this segment. Net sales were down 11% over the preceding quarter due to lower wafer starts and utilization and the seasonal reduction in fab-wide spending typical of the first quarter. Operating income was $146 million or 28% of sales, a decrease of $23 million or 14% from Q4, again primarily due to lower revenue and product mix.  Let's turn to Display. Display orders of $67 million were down $288 million or 81% from Q4. Display net sales of $230 million were up 39% year-over-year, but down 22% over the previous quarter as LCD panel makers delayed their build plans due to excess inventory levels and strong capacity additions in 2006. Operating income for this segment was $64 million or 28% of sales, a decrease of $30 million or 32% from Q4 primarily due to lower revenue and product mix.  Now Adjacent Technologies, Adjacent Technologies' net sales of $32 million were up 60% over Q4 due to the timing of revenue recognition of previously shipped equipment.  I want to talk about unallocated expenses now. Unallocated expenses of $169 million were down 15% over the previous quarter. These expenses fall into three buckets of spending of similar size. First, equity compensation and certain components of variable compensation; second, corporate marketing and sales; and third other corporate general and administrative functions. So, looking at these groupings' of costs, equity and variable compensation is down from Q4 and up slightly year-over-year. Corporate sales and marketing is essentially flat quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Costs in corporate general and administrative areas are flat from Q4, but increased year-over-year primarily reflecting investment in our business transformation initiative.  Now I will turn the call over to Mike Splinter to provide the CEO's prospective. Mike? 
Mike Splinter: Thanks George, and good afternoon. Our first quarter results demonstrate our success in meeting our operational objectives even in a challenging environment. At this point in the year, we are where we thought we would be, and I remain confident that our team will execute effectively throughout the year and deliver on the results we forecast for 2007.  Let me begin with some comments about the business environment. In our Fab Solutions segment, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a seasonal slowdown as anticipated. Wafer starts drop during the quarter with fab utilization in logic and foundry fabs approaching 80%, which is slightly lower than we had anticipated. The lower levels of fab utilization to a downward pressure on spares and service revenue. We expect to return to revenue growth in Q2, as fab loadings bottom out and begin to increase and ramp through the remainder of the year. Wafer start outlook is good for 2007 projected at 8% to 10% growth. And our Fab Solutions results are expected to exceed that level.  Our Silicon segment bookings were up in Q1 and we expect them to grow again in Q2. Memory orders were strong demonstrating the success of our new products that are growing share in this critical market segment. We expect our overall memory business to remain relatively strong and balanced over the year with NAND flash growing in the second half.  As we look out over the next three years, we see more than 20 new memory fabs being planned for production enabling new applications for both DRAM and flash to replace disk drives and enhance user experience in cell phones, PCs and game platforms.  The foundries, however, continue to hold back on capital investment and are very much in the bottom of the trough at only 11% of our bookings in Q1. From our analysis and dialogue with our customers, we expect the foundries to come back in Q3, as 65 nanometer RAMs enter high volume production.  Longer-term, we remain confident in the foundries as they concentrate additional industry R&D programs referenced in recent announcements by several top device manufacturers. We view this as a positive for the industry and especially for Applied Materials. As this allows greater efficiencies, aligns with where we have been deploying our R&D resources and should focus the industry more on device design and increase system innovation.  In December, we hosted a technical symposium with executives and technologists from leading chip companies and universities, including AMD, IBM, Intel, TI and MIT. To discuss the imminent move to 32 nanometer device and manufacturing as well as the critical design and process issues that must be resolved. More recently industry announcements on the accelerated adoption of high-k dielectrics and metal gates starting at the 45 nanometer node, clearly signal that the way forward will require new integration solutions and new materials. Applied's strong market share position in PVD, oxynitride gates and our core product capabilities and deposition at CMP and other technologies is helping us enable this industry transition.  Now let's turn to the Display business. It's clear that customers are hesitating or are in between investments. During 2006, LCD TV volume grew by more than 100% and for the first time LCD TVs pass plasma TVs in the 40 to 44 inch sweet spot. We expect TV volume to continue to grow at around 60% in '07, and therefore we do expect orders to be up slightly in Q2 with a more full recovery in orders by Q3 and in revenues by Q4.  For 2007, we expect the Display equipment market to be down 25% or more. However, our Display segment will perform better than the industry as we grow our product position in PVD color filter and e-beam test.  Let's review some of our strategic programs for 2007. In the quarter, our UVision brightfield product captured another repeat order at a key memory customer and is building on the gains achieved in 2006. We launched several new products including a metal etch product targeted at memory technology, the Applied Opus AdvantEdge. It delivers 50% improved CD control and a 50% improvement in throughput. This product is doing very well. Since its release in December, we shipped multiple systems that are already running in production.  We also launched Producer GT, a new high productivity CVD product. This system is exceeding expectations setting a record for rapid adoption and displacing the competition in multiple customers. We have 23 Producer GT systems in the field and we expect to more than triple our installed base by the end of Q2. Both the Opus and the Producer GT demonstrate the advantage of using our common platforms and software, to quickly bring new products to the market.  In an announcement released earlier today, we stated that we will cease future development of beamline implant products, and we will be closing our operations in Horsham, England. Unfortunately, the implant equipment market has changed over the past few years, and moved more towards commoditization. We don't see future returns that warrant future investments in next generation beamline products. I have assured all our customers that we are committed to their support of our installed base, and we will continue to provide capacity needs through Applied Global Services.  In our Adjacent Technologies segment, we are making solid progress to complete multiple contracts for solar equipment, working toward our objective of more than 200 million in contracts this year. We are seeing a significant rise in activity as more customers understand the impact of our technology to effectively decrease the cost of producing solar power.  Summing it up; with our improved position in Memory, expanding served market in Display, and overall strengthening market position node-to-node, I see three factors that will benefit Applied and support our success through the remainder of 2007.  First, continued investments by memory manufacturers, particularly NAND Flash in the second half. So far these investments are progressing as planned. Next, that our foundry customers commit and spend their CapEx as announced. We should have a clear picture of this by the end of Q2. Finally, that the Display producers return to capacity expansion to fulfill the needs for holiday '07 and beyond.  In the longer-term, we see plenty of opportunities where Applied can demonstrate our strengths. We are developing cutting-edge technology solutions to continue to extend Moore's Law well into the future. We are gaining in service and reinventing by delivering world class solution means for our customers.  We are expanding our Display products. Our solar efforts are gaining traction and are poised to takeoff as the market for green tech grows. We are investing in exciting high growth areas that should pay dividends to our investors for years to come.  Thank you very much, and now I'll turn the call back over to George Davis. George? 
George Davis: Thank you, Mike. Our targets for the second quarter reflect the industry dynamics that Mike just discussed. With that as a foundation, we expect orders to be up in the range of 2% to 7%. We expect revenue to be flat to up 5%. We expect EPS to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.28, with a tax rate assumption of approximately 34%. These targets do not include the effects or the impacts associated with the announced closure of our implant operations in the United Kingdom, or the costs incurred as a result of a comprehensive move to managed services in our IT function and some additional minor costs for operational efficiency improvements. The total cost of these initiatives is expected to be in the range of $105 million to $145 million, and will be expensed over the next few quarters.  Thank you. And Randy, let's now open the call for questions. 
Randy Bane: This completes our prepared remarks we will now begin our question-and-answer session. Operator let's begin with the first question please. 
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Jay Deahna with J.P. Morgan 
Jay Deahna - J.P. Morgan: Thank you, congratulations on your execution there Mike, George, couple of questions. First of all on the cycle -- we've heard some of your competitors characterize it as the memory is front half loaded and IDM and foundry comeback in second half. Just wondering to what extent you see the foundry, any idea if it's coming back. You said flash might be backend loaded as well. Just wondering whether you see kind of shipments being higher in the second half of the calendar year than the first half and what is the risk in memory in the first half? That's the first question.  Then the second question is, Intel and IBM recently made some announcements about metal gates, potentially coming in at 45 nanometers, just wondering if you can explain what that means for Applied Materials? Thank you. 
Mike Splinter: Sure. Jay, well I think you asked more than a couple. At any rate, on the -- a few comments on how the memory foundry -- how we view that. Right now as you could tell from George's comments, the front half of our year is very DRAM intensive and 50% of our orders were DRAM. We are shipping heavily to the DRAM manufacturers. That seems to be going along. We expect DRAM to phase down a little bit going into our second half and a few very big flash projects to go through and that's really what we are counting on. We do expect foundry to come back. It has been trending down over the last three quarters. Last quarter if you recall it was 16% of our orders, this quarter it's 11%. I don't think I can get a whole lot lower, we are seeing some signs now that there are some 65 nanometer and 45 nanometer buys. We see roughly 300 -- almost 300 new 65 nanometer designs in the foundries and that's usually the point where the volume really starts to take off. So, we are pretty confident about the foundries coming back in the second half of the year, it just depends how much. And if they spend what they say they were going to do, we will meet our objectives for the year.  You asked at the end of your question there about risk in the first half. For us I see very little risk in the first half, we are building to commitments and shipping our mix here for the next 13 weeks. I don't think we see much risk there.  As far as high-k metal gates and what it means for us by metal gates, I think we are in very-very good position, not only with those two customers, but we've been doing our own R&D in this area and working with customers across the industry. I think we are going to see accelerated adoption here and I think we will win all the metal gates, high-k dielectrics I think is -- high-k dielectrics is a story where we have very good technology as well and you will see us be strong as more and more companies announce their capability in that area. 
Jay Deahna - J.P. Morgan: Mike is that a situation where a batch oxide deposition could -- from one of your competitors could transition into a single wafer tool sold by Applied? 
Mike Splinter: It mostly, Jay, in the dielectric area we have a very-very strong share with our DPM product. So, where we see some potential changeover, maybe in the memory area, where most of the capacitor dielectrics are done in a batch system. But, I think most of the people who are working on advanced logic are using single wafer for this layer today. 
Jay Deahna - J.P. Morgan: Okay, thanks Mike. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Hi, thanks for taking my call. Mike, I am totally with you in thinking that the memory guys have to spend a lot between now and 2008 in terms of trying to hit their opportunities. But, if I look at the pricing in the memory market more recently, particularly focusing on DRAM. It has been down more like 25% to 30% in just the last six weeks and in all debatable with what's really going on. But, when you are saying that you don't see much risk for memory in the first half, is that based on what you are hearing from your customers today? Are you handicapping that to any extent for the big memory prices? 
Mike Splinter: We have to look at the memory pricing over a little bit longer-term, and if you look back to 2006, DRAM prices were incredibly strong, I think probably set a record for strength. And so seeing 20% plus downside here in the first part of 2007, I don't think is very surprising at all as some additional capacity comes on. But I think people are going to continue to put on this capacity with the projected big growth as the conversion to Vista occurs. And I think there has been a lot written lately about Vista hasn't spurred any increased demand in PCs, I don't think it would. I do think that it will spur increased growth in DRAMs and PCs over the year as more and more of the computers are incorporated with Vista onboard and the experience improves with utilizing increased DRAM onboard with those machines. So that's our view, and I think that's going to drive an awful lot of bit growth in DRAM in the second half of the year. Also if you look at the DRAM makers' profitability also set records last year. I think they have a lot of room to move down in pricing without much affecting their profitability. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. Specifically looking out into the April quarter, when you are guiding up for bookings. What are you assuming for Silicon bookings and within Silicon what's the assumption for Memory and Logic and Foundry? 
George Davis: Yes. Satya, hi, this is George. We are not going to be guiding on a segment basis. So overall I think the general industry trends that we talked about are going to have to suffice. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Citigroup 
Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi guys, couple of things. First of all, if I listen to your biggest customers in the memory space and I listened to their public conferences calls last month, they pretty strongly indicated that the CapEx would be front-half loaded this year by about two to one and since then NAND pricing has gotten worse than what they even thought it would be in Q1. And of course as the prior question indicated, DRAM price was worse as well. But do you see memory splitting being more balanced for the year, so you don't actually agree with what they said, is that kind of what I should read from this? 
George Davis: You should take our call -- Tim you should take our comments on our fiscal year and the way we see our revenue playing out here in our delivery discussions with them, we think that over the year, it's going to be pretty balanced. DRAM will be loaded in the front-half and more flash in the second half. 
Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay. I guess then, just as a follow-up, George. If you are not going to give out what silicon orders will be in the April quarter, which is embedded in your up two to seven. You did say that silicon orders would be up, is that right? And I just want to confirm that also that means that memory orders will be up as well? 
George Davis: Yeah I think that's right. Tim, you can assume -- one thing that you are going to assume is our AGS orders will follow their traditional seasonal pattern with Q1 being by far the highest quarter. 
Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay guys, thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS 
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay, hi thank you. So Mike, is it fair to assume that you think that just January quarter was the trough order quarter in this cycle? I guess that's my first question. 
Mike Splinter: Well I believe it was certainly trough orders for logic and foundries. Yes. 
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay and -- 
George Davis: And Display. 
Mike Splinter: Yeah, and display thanks. 
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay. Fair enough. And then, could you please share with us what your estimates for 2007 semiconductor CapEx could be? And do you think AMAT can grow faster than that? 
Mike Splinter: Sure. We think semiconductor CapEx is going to be roughly a little over 4% increase year-over-year. We think WFE will grow a little faster than that, closer to 6. So, pick a small range there. And then we think Applied Materials will grow faster than that, primarily because during the last year and half we've gained an awful lot of share in the memory area and we are gaining node-to-node. So as 65 nanometer builds out and 45 nanometer starts to get a little bit beyond the R&D stage, I think we'll see positive effects. 
Stephen Chin - UBS: Great, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward White with Lehman Brothers. 
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- more about the dynamics of logic trends. We've talked about some of the memory trends, but how do you see that playing out as the year unfolds? 
Mike Splinter: What we think you want is calendar Q1 will be the bottoming out of the utilization fall. We have seen it fall to 80% and probably go a little bit below that before it starts to come back in particular, in the foundries. But then I believe with a number of products, and you've heard announcements in the last few days from the likes of QUALCOMM and Broadcom how they are moving their product line to 65 nanometer. We think that build out of the 65 nanometer and ramp-up of those products is going to help drive the rest of the year for the foundries. And really that will be the thing that gets them to spend their projected capital that they've talked about earlier in the year. As far as logic -- as the big logic players go there, they seem to be dwindling as more companies announce that they're going to depend more on foundries. That kind of -- that will also help push more volume to the foundries as well. But we see the two big logic makers continuing on their plans to spend their capital. And we think that will be more balanced over the year. 
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then secondly, do you see any lasting cost benefit from the Horsham shutdown? In other words, any financial benefit that goes beyond the one-time charges you've talked about? 
George Davis: Hi, this is George. Yes we certainly do. Clearly that business was going to be operating at a loss this year and based on the investment that would have been required competitively, it would have been operating at a loss for at least the next few years after that as well. So, in essence, that's an avoidance obviously you have the cost structure associated with that as well, that was talked about in the release. 
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Great, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with Morgan Stanley. 
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Hi, good afternoon. Mike, you talked a lot about the chip design and tape-out activity at 65 nanometers and we have seen quite a few of the leading fabless semiconductor companies, as you mentioned, making aggressive moves to that technology node. My guess is that with the design cycle times as they are, the foundries will need more capacities to put all these tape-outs by the middle of this year. And so with that in mind are you expecting the foundry order contribution for 65 nanometer in the April quarter to be up significantly, or is that more of a July quarter ramp? 
Mike Splinter: We believe it will be up in this quarter, but we believe it will be up modestly and then we think it will be strong in our July quarter -- our quarter that ends in July. 
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. And along those same lines, do you still expect memory to represent about 50% to 60% of the semi-product mix for the foreseeable future or do the foundry and logic guys start to increase as a part of the mix, second half? 
Mike Splinter: Our current projection, Harlan, is for -- for memory spending this year to be about half of the overall WFE spending. And obviously when you look at the overall mix that the percentages are higher in the front half because foundry and logic is so relatively low. So, I think that covers it. 
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay great. And then question for you George. With the reestablishment of the R&D tax credit, I thought your tax rate would have dropped by a percent or two but you are guiding 34%, is that correct going forward? 
George Davis: Yeah it's -- the R&D tax credit Harlan, is a little less than 1% benefit for us and so obviously we have -- we will have the full year effect of the refund spread out over the year, but that was all taken in the first quarter. 
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Got it. And what was responsible for the -- just last question, what was responsible for the lower than expected tax rate in the first quarter? 
George Davis: In Q1, we had a settlement of some prior years Federal Tax Audits that resulted in about a four point impact on our tax rate and again about $0.02 per share on EPS. 
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you very much. 
George Davis: You're welcome. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh with CIBC World Markets 
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Hi guys. I am going to switch gears a little bit here and focus down on cost. You guys have done a pretty good job here in Q1 on renting and cost, if I look at your Silicon business, your core business, you are hitting around 35% gross margin and if I look at a comparable run-rate in the last fiscal year, you are 200 basis points lower. So you are obviously doing something in the right direction in your core Silicon business.  Now, I just wanted to ask a quick question George, it sounds like a lot of the equity compensation seems to have affected or benefited in the quarter, the unallocated costs. Just wondering what specifically drove margins up in the silicon business in Q1, whether the shutdowns or anything else that you might be doing. And a follow-up to that would be, at the current $1500 million revenue run-rate throughout the rest this year, given that you are cutting the ion implant business. How much can you grow margins with that sort of flattish revenues? 
George Davis: Yeah, let me just talk about the cost picture in general and again we don't break out gross margin by saying that, but I think the answer is instructive across all of our groups. First of, in the first quarter we knew that revenue was going to be down for the quarter. So, its going to be a little bit of a challenging quarter. So, across the Board, cost controls were put into place and these are cost cutting in addition to shutdown. But, longer-term we also have a number of initiatives that you are aware of, will be in manufacturing and their moves to modular tests and the merge and transit. Obviously, we constantly are working on lowering our material costs, which also impacts gross margin and in particular for Silicon and for Fab Solutions.  And then on the OpEx side, we are actually in an investment mode right now on business transformation. So, we will be investing in that and you see that, that shows up in unallocated expenses in '07, but we expect to start to see the real benefits from that in '08. So in general, in a period particularly -- quarter where we were challenged like Q1, we are going to be very cost conscious, which means we have to be very thoughtful about it. But at the same time, we are going to continue to invest in the new product introductions that Mike talked about and other strategic priorities of the company. 
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: George, I guess my question was that, basically the knife on AMAT has been that its going straight from its former financial target and now you've had one quarter where it looks like you are making up or gaining some lost ground there. Are you going be able to kind of give us some targets here by the different segments in terms of revenue run-rate and what your targeted operating margins should be in those businesses? I think that would be pretty helpful? 
George Davis: As you noted, we are right on model this quarter. But I think the -- I mean you have to take into account that the model when it was established, the company had a very different mix, it had a different capital structure, and it didn't take in to account anything -- it didn't have a option expensing in place. And so, one of the things that people struggle with is, doing the adjustments to the model. But the fact to the matter is segment reporting really makes the comparison to the old model less relevant. You have far more visibility into the business than you've had, and I don't think we intend to put targets out for each segment. But rather I think it gives you -- you'll have an opportunity to really see how the segments improve overtime, and I think that will be the indicator whether the improvements that we are driving through the organization are making it to the bottom-line which is a key priority for me. 
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay. And finally George, if I just can try and pin you down here on operating margins for the Silicon business, you hit 35% operating margins. Now if revenues were to be flat at the current $1.5 billion and you are cutting your implant business. Just on cutting the implant business, how much more could you see your operating margin expand off 35% in Q1? 
George Davis: And Gary, we'll have a lot better view of that after we go through the process of evaluating all of our customer commitments and working with our customers over this quarter as we wind down Horsham. Why don't we talk about this next quarter? 
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Alright, perfect. Thank you so much. 
George Davis: You bet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch. 
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on the -- it sound like that the cost savings from shutting down Horsham and changing the ion implant business, aren't necessarily built in sort of to the forecast yet? 
George Davis: That's correct. 
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then if you look at the process you went through in deciding to shutdown the ion implant development Mike, are there other product lines that you think might not be meeting your hurdle rates going forward or is that pretty much yet? 
Mike Splinter: Well we don't -- we are not going to make any announcements today Brett. We made one I think that's -- that kept us pretty busy, but we are looking at all of our underperforming businesses and evaluating their strategic position in the company and whether we think that they can grown and be significant contributors to the overall company and to our shareholders. So I don't have much to say on that other than we are going to use the same kind of process and we are using that same kind of process to evaluate every one of our businesses. 
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Very good thing --? 
George Davis: And that applies to our products as well, we are taking a look at whether or not a new product investment is likely to provide a sufficient return. 
Mike Splinter: Now this is a good thing, George is driving throughout the company. So you can expect kind of better performance or else kind of -- 
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Bachman with Pacific Crest Securities. 
Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Hi Mike. In the press release today, there was a comment attributed to you, and I think you mentioned again on this call that you felt that the implant market had moved towards commoditization. Can you explain what this means and how the implant segment would be any different than the other segments of the cap equipments space, say at your planarization or deposition? 
Mike Splinter: Well ion implant is -- I think there is very little differentiation between the five suppliers in the market, and everybody can accelerate ions and embed them in Silicon in relatively similar ways. The difference between almost any other area is the other areas are very application intensive and whether that -- just an example in our CVD area, advanced patterning films or stressed nitride, these kind of things are very difficult, very interactive. And unlike implant, where you can see prices under pressure and the end market not getting the kind of gross margins that we would expect short-term or long-term. 
Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: I was just wondering there, if the products are so much alike, wouldn't there be equal market share then across all the competitors there? 
Mike Splinter: Then it get's down to who is really in pricing games. So -- but that's what it ends up being. 
George Davis: Mark, this is George. I think also if you just look historically at the financial returns for all the players within the implant segment. I think it kind of supports that view as well. 
Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, let me see. Also in that press release today, the only location that was mentioned was Horsham. Is there going to be any changes to your implant activities at Beverly, Massachusetts? 
George Davis: Well Beverly is incorporated into the overall implant division that's correct, so there will be changes there as well. 
Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. And then just the last thing there, on the release also you only discussed beamline architectures. Does this suggest here that Applied has not given up on its non-beam technologies? 
George Davis: Yes that's correct. 
Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you so much. 
Mike Splinter: Also I want to add, we have a very healthy and growing service business -- service and spares business that's supporting implant and that will continue. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Maire with Needham. 
Robert Maire - Needham and Company: Yes, by the way congratulations on some nice numbers. Two questions, given that we've gone through what to me appears at least to be a relatively benign down cycles, you can call it a down cycle really more like a soft period. And the upper part of the cycle was relatively benign as well. Are we moving into a sort of a new period here where the delta between the peak operating revenue is off by perhaps 20% 30% from what we would experience during the weak period as compared to the bad old days when we had 60%, 70%, 80% variations? 
Mike Splinter: I guess I would answer the question in two different ways Robert. In this particular part of the cycle that we've -- let's just kind of go back over the last few quarters. The downside and the depth of the trough of the foundries have been massed by continued investment by the memory manufacturers, and a significant growth in the memory manufacturers. So, I think that in part, the trough has been massed.  Now, lots of things have happened in the industry, including shorter lead-times, better management of inventory. All those kind of elements that help mute the peaks and the troughs. I think because we see better management in our customers, we are trying to do a better job of running our operations and being more responsive in allowing our customers to add capacity quicker. So, I do think that peaks and troughs will be muted. I don't know how to give you an estimate, if we take a look at 2005 to 2006. I think that -- and then 2007, I think 2005 capital spending was off 10%, but it wasn't off as much because memory was spending more. 2006 was up 25%, nominally 20% to 25%, but that was probably up a little more than we might think, because memories were spending and then at the end of the year it massed the troughs. So, I think once we get through this big growth cycle in memory, we will be able to tell. I do expect peaks and troughs to be more muted. But hard to judge whether that means plus or minus 20%. I am much more apt to think it's in that range than plus or minus 60 or bigger percentages that we saw in the past. 
Robert Maire - Needham and Company: Okay. And the other question was, in terms of the assets from Horsham and your beamline implant, any potential thoughts about selling any of those assets or would you be holding on to those, given perhaps other technologies or any disposition of those? 
George Davis: Sure, hi Rob, it's George. Our view on that is it's really a function of -- we needed to take action today we felt and going down a path of selling or an acquisition just was inconsistent with that time table, but that's certainly something that we can consider overtime. Our key thing is to meet our customer requirements and to make sure that commitments that we made are fully met and their needs going forward are anticipated. Once we get through that process and are obviously making sure that our employees are treated as fairly as possible. Then we can consider some other alternatives. 
Robert Maire - Needham and Company: Okay, great. Thank you, congrats again. 
George Davis: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. 
Kate Kozlowski - Goldman Sachs: Hi, this is [Kate Kozlowski] on behalf of Jim Covello. Most of my questions have been answered, but I was hoping to get a clarification in terms of what your non-GAAP gross margins were during the quarter? I noticed there was 13 million items associated with the write-up of the inventory fair value. I was wondering if that's something we should be taking out of the gross margin line? 
Mike Splinter: Yeah, I would say that the impact on gross margin was less than half a point from acquisition activities. 
Kate Kozlowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just one other question. In terms of your services bookings, how did that do quarter-over-quarter compared to your product bookings? 
Mike Splinter: Service bookings were up. Again the service business has their peak orders in Q1, whilst customers renew their service contracts. Silicon orders were also up but to a lesser extent. 
Kate Kozlowski - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgerald with Banc of America. 
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Thanks. The guidance about the $200 million in bookings in for the Solar business, is that into the traditional Solar markets or is there evidence here that this amorphous Silicon application that you guys have been working on is taking off? 
Mike Splinter: That $200 million will be mostly -- if not all, in flat -- in thin film amorphous silicon. We will and we already do have orders for nitride deposition systems for the crystalline silicon. But we are very focused on thin film solar cells which we think will drive cost down, Mark. So we are excited about that. 
George Davis: Hey Mark, it's George. Just let me add one point to that, you used the term bookings. So we have been very careful to use the term contracts. These are -- this is a new market that we are entering and new business models will be used and so we are not using the term bookings, we are really reflecting to contractual commitments that we make with customers. 
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Okay. And just a follow-on to that. In this -- the contract that you guys have written here, is there any evidence that people -- that this -- what you are selling here is into these large megawatt facilities that somebody is actually putting in other than development [minds] your capacity for this amorphous silicon application? 
Mike Splinter: No, this will be real capacity Mark. In fact one of the things that we -- one of the indicators we intend to give you as we start mounting these up is how many megawatts of capacity we have sold. In my mind, this is kind of the measure of how much progress there we will be making over the year. So you can look forward to us, keeping a running indicator on how many megawatts of solar power we are selling. 
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up question here, on the share count for your EPS, for the guidance here what are you using? 
George Davis: We are not giving a guidance, I can give you the weighted average shares for the quarter if that would be helpful? 
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: For the April quarter? 
George Davis: No for the January quarter? 
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Okay I have got that one. I am sorry, okay. 
George Davis: Okay. 
Mike Splinter: We have to buy the shares back first Mark. Well I am not sure how many, but we have got a range. 
George Davis: We have said 300 million to 400 million in shares. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank Securities. 
Steven O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you. What drove the Silicon segment backlog adjustments, and can you quantify what they were? 
George Davis: Most of the adjustments were deep bookings, and so again just being pushed outside, we had minor cancellations, about 25 million in cancellations, which was split between the Silicon business and the [refer] business in our Fab Solutions. 
Steven O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Can you say what segments? Was this a memory segment, was it logic, foundry or --? 
George Davis: No we don't break it out to that level of detail. 
Steven O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. And one other follow-up. On the 45 nanometer metal gates, is there a way to quantify the incremental opportunity per fab that Applied Materials can address? 
Mike Splinter: It's a little bit difficult, I haven't really done it in the average of a 30,000 wafer fab, but you can expect that there will be a different system for P-channel transistors, different systems for N-channel transistors as these products start to move out into production. 
Steven O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Fair enough, thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with FBR . 
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: Yes, thank you for taking my question. Two, one is a follow-up. Mike in your prepared remarks, you were talking about the one large flash order that could possibly materialize in the second half of calendar year. Could you give us some idea as to what are the milestones for these large orders to actually take place? Is that mostly driven by a strategic investment or is something else out there? And then also the markets in the Silicon business, the markets still are strong, I assume CVD, PVD. What is the growth projection you are seeing if the WFE is going to grow at 6% plus this year? Would you expect a double digit growth out of the CVD, PVD segments? 
Mike Splinter: Well we don't really give that kind of projection down to the product level. But on your first question Mehdi the -- actually what I said was there were several orders. A small number of major factor of flash factories are going in, in the second half of the year and that's really where -- what we are counting on is the three big flash guys, I don't think there is any secret about who they are or where their big fabs are. We are expecting them to -- those three companies to continue their capacity expansion as planned. So I don't think its any more fancy than that. I will say that we do expect CVD to continue to grow faster than the overall WFE market by a substantial amount. As there is so many more applications coming in the CVD space. 
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: Okay. And then going back to the flash commentary, Micron was talking about maybe as much as a 40% reduction in the dye costs, but they have to get their fab capacity up to 40-k to 50-k per month. And so to that extent, these three flash projects that are scheduled for second half, it seems to me is more a strategic and as long as flash prices don't drop to zero or less than zero, they are going to go ahead and execute that. Could you share your opinion on that? 
George Davis: I believe they are going to execute their plans. I don't know that I would use the word strategic, these companies are very competitive and hard driving, trying to capture share in a fast growing mark. At least the unit is -- at least units are fast growing. We still expect that growth to be 150% this year, so as still our thought process I think that's much the thought process of many other customers and why they are investing. 
Mehdi Hosseini - FBR: Okay, thank you. 
George Davis: Excuse me, operator, we have time for one more question. 
Operator: Okay. Our last question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks a lot. You answered a lot of my questions already, but hearing from some of your competitors this earning season about near-term order trends, some of which are guiding flat to down sequentially. Can some of your upside be attributed to your strength or your better than expected market share gains, particularly in the memory market. Am I correct to assume that? 
Mike Splinter: Patrick we believe that you would be correct in assuming that, that if we look back to 2005, our share in memories was -- I don't want to use the word dismal, but maybe it's the best description and we have worked very hard on the applications that are affective for the memory makers. We have actually made more progress with the flash manufacturers than the DRAM manufacturers, but we have made very-very good progress there as well. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay great, and I guess as a follow-up to the market share story is this also correct to assume that you remain highly leveraged to the foundry group and once they pickup their spending trends as you are forecasting, perhaps in the second half of this calendar year. That should also allow you guys to benefit from that recovery? 
Mike Splinter: Yes we feel like we have maintained and even strengthened our position with the foundries a bit. We have invested and worked hard in particular with the IBM group and invested in Albany. We have very solid and strong relationship with DSMC, UMC Chartered and SMIC. So, if they comeback in the second half in the year in a way we expect, it should be very positive for us. 
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: Great, thank you. 
George Davis: Thank you. We would like to thank you all for joining us today. We would also like to remind you that there will be a replay of this call available to you on our website beginning at 5:00 pm today, and will be there and remain posted until February 28. Thank you for your interest in Applied Materials this concludes our call. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call, you may now disconnect.

Operator Instructions:
 Randy Bane - Vice President of Investor Relations : Thank you and good afternoon and welcome to Applied Materials’ Fiscal Q4 2006 and year end Conference Call. Joining me today on the call are Mike Splinter, President and CEO; George Davis, Chief Financial Officer; Nancy Handel, Senior Vice President; Joe Sweeney, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Today we will discuss our results for the period ending October 29, 2006. The financial results were released this afternoon at 1:05pm Pacific Time and a copy of the news release is available on Business Wire and on our Website at www.appliedmaterials.com.  Today's earnings call contains forward-looking statements including those related to Applied's financial performance, our technology leadership, served markets, growth, strategy and opportunities, new product development, operational efficiencies, tax rate, cash generation and deployment, financial targets, and the outlook for the semiconductor industry, display and solar industries. All forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by such statements. Information concerning these risk factors is contained in today's earnings press release and in the Company's filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 15, 2006 and the Company assumes no obligation to update such statements.  Today's call also contains non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP are contained in our earnings press release issued today and in our earnings call highlights document, both of which are available on the Investor's page of our website. George Davis will open with some remarks on our new segmentation reporting and then hand it over to Nancy who will discuss financial results for Q4 and year end. After Nancy, Mike will highlight Company results for 2006 and outline our strategy for the upcoming year and provide some insight into the industry dynamics that may affect our Company. George will then close with commentary with our first fiscal quarter 2007 targets. After these remarks, we will open the call for questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to George. George?
 George Davis – Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Randy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, let me say how pleased I am to be named Applied Materials' CFO. This is a homecoming for me, having spent the majority of my seven years at Applied working in finance. Over these past years, I've been focused on further building Applied's corporate business development capability. While it's been an exciting and busy two weeks since stepping into the CFO role, I am inheriting a strong leadership team in finance from Nancy. And I would like to thank her for her efforts through this transition period and her commitment to making this process as seamless as possible. Our global finance team has benefited from Nancy's leadership over the past two years and the Company has benefited from her two decades of service. I know that I speak for everyone in finance when I wish her the best in retirement.  But before she goes, we have one more job for her and that's to detail our financial results for the period on this call. She will also participate in the Q&A session to address the strong 2006 results delivered on her watch.  As described in our press release, we will be reporting our results with additional information going forward. After the acquisition of Applied Films, we made certain changes to our internal financial reporting structure during Q4. And as a result, we are now reporting four segments, Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and Adjacent Technologies. The Silicon segment manufactures and sells equipment to fabricate semiconductor chips. The Fab Solutions segment offers a broad range of products to maintain and optimize customers' semiconductor fabs, including total parts management, spare parts, remanufactured equipment, maintenance agreements, total support programs, and environmental and software solutions. The display segment manufacturers, sells and services equipment used to make flat panel displays.  Finally, the Adjacent Technologies segment, manufactures, sells and services equipment used to fabricate solar else, flexible electronics, and energy efficient glass. A description of each of these segments is included in our press release and in the financial highlights presentation available on our Website. We are limiting our segment commentary on this call to fourth quarter net sales. In mid-December, additional segment information, including orders and income from operations for the fiscal year will be presented in our Form 10-K filing, which will be made available on our Website and will be followed by a special conference call to answer your questions. And so I'd now like to ask Nancy to discuss the results for both Q4 and FY2006. Following her remarks and Mike's comments, I'll be back to deliver our targets. Nancy?
 Nancy Handel - Senior Vice President : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In my remarks, I'll discuss the financial results for Q4 and the fiscal year. Orders totaled $2.69 billion for the quarter, up slightly from the prior quarter, with gains from coming from our industry-leading interconnect solutions, such as advanced patterning films, gains in Etch, record orders for Fab Solutions, and strong demand for our new generation 8.5 flat panel display system. Bookings for new Silicon systems this quarter had the following mix. DRAM was 34%; logic and other, 31%; Flash memory, 19%; and Foundry, 16%. Approximately 92% of orders for new Silicon systems were for 300mm and virtually all for 100 nanometer and below process technology.  During Q1, nearly 81% of our orders were from outside North America. Demand from North America, Japan, Southeast Asia and Europe strengthened. Orders by major geographic areas were, Japan, 22%; Taiwan, 21%; North America, 19%; Korea, 15%; Southeast Asia and China, 13%; and Europe, 10%. Fourth quarter bookings included six orders in excess of $100 million. 10 orders between $50 and $100 million. And 12 orders between $10 and $50 million. Backlog for Q4 increased to $3.4 billion, compared to $3.32 billion for Q3 2006. Backlog adjustments totaled $97 million, consisting primarily of orders from a display customer that were rescheduled for shipment beyond 12 months. Revenue for Q4 was $2.25 billion, 1% lower than last quarter and within our published target with particular strength in system sales to memory customers and record revenue from Fab Solutions.  Net sales by segment for Q4 were, Silicon, $1.61 billion. Fab Solutions, $590 million. Display, $296 million. And Adjacent Technologies, $20 million. Reported gross margin for Q4 decreased 100bps to 47.1%, compared to 48.1% for Q3 2006. As expected, the decline in gross margin was primarily due to charges related to the amortization of purchase technology and lower margins on certain Applied Films products. Equity-based compensation charges of $9 million were included in this quarter's gross margin. Fourth quarter operating expenses, consisting of R&D, marketing and selling, and G&A, were $550 million, 1% higher than last quarter.  These expenses included $20 million for Applied Films and some increased spending on the Company's multiyear business transformation initiative, offset by adjustments in incentive compensation and benefits.  Operating income was $635 million or 25.2% of revenues, 160bps lower than the 26.8% reported for Q3 2006. Net interest income for the quarter was $28 million, $13 million lower than the previous quarter as a result of lower average cash balances after the $2.5 billion accelerated stock buyback. The effective tax rate for Q4 was 32%, in line with expectations and 3% higher than Q3. We anticipate the effective tax rate for the next quarter will be approximately 34.5%, as a result of decreases in the export tax credit. Net income was $449 million or $0.30 per share, compared to $512 million or $0.33 for Q3. We met our EPS target for this quarter.  The reduction in outstanding shares as a result of the accelerated stock buyback had a positive $0.01 impact on EPS for the quarter, offsetting the decrease in interest income mentioned previously. Our financial model based on non-GAAP metrics was developed to enhance understanding of ongoing operational performance. The model excludes items deemed by management to be unusual or nonrecurring. Non-GAAP net income of $482 million or $0.33 per share was slightly lower than our financial model. Excluding the impacts of a higher effective tax rate and Applied Films, as we discussed last quarter, we would have met our model.  The reconciliation of our reported EPS of $0.30 to our non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 was included with our press release. Now, I would like to discuss highlights of our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and investments decreased $1.95 billion to $3.21 billion. The Company used $2.64 billion in cash for share repurchases, which included the accelerated stock buyback. And paid cash dividends of $77 million, partially offset by $660 million in cash generated from operations.  During Q4, the company repurchased 154 million shares of our common stock for $2.64 billion, at an average purchase price of $17.15 per share. Since the beginning of fiscal 2005, the Company has repurchased approximately 340 million shares, representing approximately 20% of the shares outstanding at October 31, 2004, for a cash outlay of $5.8 billion. During Q1 2007, we do not plan to repurchase additional shares. Beginning in Q2, we do expect to restart our systematic repurchase program. In September, 2006, the company declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share, payable on December 7 to stockholders of record as of November 16.  Accounts receivable decreased by $268 million and day sales outstanding decreased by 9 days to 73 days, principally due to strong receivables collection. Inventory increased by $65 million, principally due to increases in raw materials and work in process inventory. Capital spending for the quarter was $59 million. And depreciation and amortization totaled $73 million. Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $600 million, up from $322 million in the prior quarter, reflecting strong accounts receivable performance. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures.  Head count at the end of the quarter was 14,072 regular employees. Fiscal 2006 was the second-best year in the company's history. New orders were $9.89 billion, a 55% increase from $6.39 billion for fiscal 2005. Net sales for FY2006 were $9.17 billion, a 31% increase from $6.99 billion for fiscal 2005. Net income for FY2006 was $1.52 billion, or $0.97 per share, up from $1.21 billion or $0.73 per share for fiscal 2005. Non-GAAP net incomes for FY2006 was $1.8 billion or $1.15 per share, up from $1.12 billion or $0.68 per share for fiscal 2005. I would like to thank our employees for a great quarter that finished an outstanding year. And I would also like to thank the investment community for their support during my years as Chief Financial Officer. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike Splinter to provide the CEO's perspective. Mike?
 Michael R. Splinter - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon. 2006 was an excellent year for Applied Materials. We grew revenue, gained share, and delivered on our objectives. The dedication of our employees and their commitment to deliver for our customers was demonstrated throughout the year. And I would like to acknowledge their contributions to these strong results.  For 2006, we set three clear objectives.  First, extend our leadership in our core business through differentiated products. Our main focus was to increase our presence at memory manufacturers, particularly those in the fast-growing Flash market. In 2006, we improved our position across multiple product lines as our technology-leading solutions drove broader market acceptance. Our thin films group continues to demonstrate strength, for example winning over PVD runoff in 2006. We are delivering innovative solutions, like advanced patterning films, selective EPI, and strained silicon.  These differentiated products led to major market share gains in the memory area. In 2006, we improved our overall Etch market share, growing faster than the competition. Looking forward, we expect gains in 45 nanometer development decisions, where specific technology inflections favor Applied's Etch products. We made significant progress with our UVision Brightfield inspection system. We now have repeat orders at three companies of the 13 now having a UVision installed. In display, we gained share with both our PECVD and EV and tester products as AKT set records for revenue, bookings and profits this year. In fact, with strong 2004 bookings, total orders exceeded $1 billion for the year.  We announced a Gen 8.5 product line that processes 5.6 square meters of glass in a single chamber. In addition, we acquired Applied Films to provide significant growth in the PVD arena. Applied Global Services delivers solutions that boost productivity and reduce costs for customers and that success is showing up in our growth metrics for AGS. Our revenue per wafer start is up 9% year-over-year. In 2006, we also expanded our significant portfolio of environmental solutions with new systems that improve performance, reduce emissions, and lower energy consumption.  Our second objective was to grow in new markets, utilizing our nano manufacturing technology. We delivered by entering the markets for flat panel color filter and array PVD, photoresist coaters and solar photovoltaic cells. Our chamber performance systems expanded through the acquisition of ChemTrace and we are now addressing the market for specialty coatings for semiconductor equipment. Also, our proposed acquisition of Brooks Software, when completed, will further expand our opportunities in Fab software solutions and enhance our core service offerings. With the addition of these new products and markets, our total market opportunity increased by over 30% since the beginning of 2006.  Our third objective was to deliver world-class operational and financial performance. As Nancy reviewed in detail, we made good progress operationally over the year, delivering higher margins and improved asset utilization, while ensuring that we are investing in the future. Looking to 2007 and beyond, we'll build on our 2006 momentum. We are confident that our market opportunities in the silicon segment are growing significantly. The semiconductor industry continues to see strong unit growth, particularly in the memory segment. The industry should see revenue growth in the 5% to 10% range as we enter a period of accelerated DRAM bit growth created by several factors including Microsoft's VISTA operating system.  While we expect a short-term order pause in Q1, we believe 2007 will see an increase in wafer fab equipment spending. With our forecast estimate forecasting an increase a roughly of approximately 6%. With our focus on creating advanced systems and solutions, as we move through each node, the buildout of 65 nanometers and the technology buys for 45 nanometers will be positive for Applied Materials. Therefore we expect to grow our Silicon business by more than 10% in 2007 despite a rather slow start.  We are projecting memory customers to represent more than 50% of our Silicon Systems orders for the foreseeable futures as foundries and logic companies investments will be up only slightly, with increased spending expected to come in the second half of 2007 as they come our of a low investment period. During the past several years, we have put significant emphasis on a creating a robust, new product pipeline. We have now have over 50 products and application projects in development, compared to fewer than 30 a year ago. This increase is, in part, due to our more efficient use of our existing platforms, software and the development of new applications on existing products.  We are improving parts commonality to enable faster new product development and to reduce material and development costs. In addition, our development centers in Bangalore, India, and Xi'an, China, are enabling round the clock development to reduce time to market. New products like the recently-introduced producer GT, the industry's most productive and cost effective CVD platform, are a key to our continued growth, as it dramatically improved our competitiveness in the $700 million dielectric commodity films market. In Fab Solutions, increasing wafer starts and our large and expanding installed base provide a solid foundation for growth.  This business is expected to be up in 2007 by capturing an increasing amount of fabs' operational spend. As customers look for improved productivity, they are demanding technically differentiated service products. Coating, cleaning, wafer reclaim, abatement, and software all become more valuable to customers who will be looking for better utilization of their factories. In 2007, we expect an incremental $100 million of revenue just from these new products alone. In display, market forecasts predict a declining equipment investment in 2007 as the industry rationalizes its current capacity and assesses the holiday sell-through.  With the addition of PVD color filter and array systems to our product line, we expect to perform better than the industry in this area. In our solar division, our large-scale PVD and PECVD systems will provide the speed, conversion efficiency, and factory productivity to lower the cost per watt from just over $3 today to less than $1 in the future. During 2007, we expect to gain significant traction in the solar market as demand grows for cleaner, more environmentally power solutions. Solar unlocks an opportunity for us to provide leadership and productivity at a time when the industry is poised to take off. We expect customer contracts in excess of $200 million in 2007. 2006 was a very good year for Applied Materials.  We executed on our strategies and are poised to continue the positive momentum in 2007. I am confident our strategies will take advantage of the opportunities ahead of us. As we close FY2006, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Nancy Handel for her long and excellent service to Applied Materials, as a leader in finance for more than 21 years and for the last two years as CFO. Nancy, we wish you the best in retirement and thank you for your many, many contributions in making Applied Materials the great Company it is today. I'll now turn the call over to George Davis to provide our first fiscal quarter 2007 targets. George?
 George Davis: Thank you, Mike. Our strategy is based on continuing the momentum we have built in 2006. As Mike mentioned, fiscal 2007 is expected to be a positive growth year for Applied Materials. In our first fiscal quarter, however, we expect to experience a modest pullback as our silicon and display customers adjust their spending and take a reading on their markets. Coming off a record year and fourth quarter in our display segment, we are expecting customers in that segment to significantly reduce orders in the first half of the year. Q1 display orders are expect to be down approximately $200 million from Q4. We expect the normal seasonal increase in the Fab Solutions segment orders as customers renew their annual service contracts.  Given this background, our targets reflect a more cautious, near-term industry condition. For Q1, we expect orders to be down in the range of 5% to 10%. We expect revenue to be down 5% to 10% as well. We expect EPS to be $0.26 to $0.27, which includes an estimated $0.02 for equity-based compensation, and approximately $0.01 related to Applied Films and Sokudo. Thank you. Randy, let's now open the call for questions.
 Randy Bane: We will now begin our question-and-answer session. 
Operator:
Operator instructions.:
Q - Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Just a quick question here on the order breakdown. Could you try and qualitatively talk about where you're seeing most of the decline, is it down 5% to 10%? Is that mostly coming from flat panel display or silicon? What's the split here?
A – Mike Splinter: I think what you're seeing is clearly a big drop in display, as we said, a much more modest drop on the Silicon side, and then a seasonal up tick, as you would expect, in the Fab Solutions segment.
Q - Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay. Because it looks like bookings are probably dropping on a gross basis around $200 million and that's exactly the drop in flat panel display. So you're just seeing a slight drop here in Silicon Systems, right?
A – Mike Splinter: Yes. I think we're comfortable with the guidance.
Q - Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay. George, quick, a longer term question here. When can we expect you to kind of emerge out of the woods in terms of integration of these dilutive deals? And when do you think you'll be able to articulate a longer term financial model that's somewhat back on track with what the model was pre-options?
A – George Davis: Pre-options. Well, you've got a fair amount of moving parts there. But I think we're very comfortable with the M&A activity that's taking place this year. We think it's very positive towards our growth. We're committed to model performance and we'll talk about the model later, but we don't anticipate the model changing. We anticipate performing to that. I'm not sure what your point was on the options?
Q - Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: No, it was just the model prior to FAS 123. Last question here, real quick, how much are you baking in for the Brooks automation in terms of opex in the January quarter?
A – George Davis: Well, first off, we have to close the deal. So there's nothing in the forecast at this time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Q - Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thank you for going through the disclosures by segment, I think it's extremely useful. A couple of questions. I have in my notes here back in 2000, in Q4, service was about 12% of your revenues. Is it fair to say it has approximately doubled in percentage terms from back then to now?
A – Nancy Handel: If you go back to 2000 and then look at where we are today, it's roughly doubled. I can grab that 2004 number in a second here, yes. We have basically have doubled since 2000 and the numbers in 2004 would have kind of been the midpoint in that transition.
Q - Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Right. I know you're going to talk about the profitability in your K but can you give us a sense whether this doubling was neutral or accretive or dilutive to your overall margins?
A – Nancy Handel: You're referring to the service business?
Q - Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Right.
A – Nancy Handel: The service business really contributes very strongly to the bottom line because it doesn't have the same kind of BLE and R&D infrastructure that the equipment business has. So, the profitability there is a strong contributor for the Company.
Q - Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. And a final question here. When you look out to your bookings guidance for January, can you give me a sense as to what the order composition is doing in memory for the semiconductor portion?
A – Mike Splinter: Well, the order book will be over 50% on memory. Again, it was 53% in the last quarter. We don't think there's going to be major shifts there. Memory is going to continue to be over 50% of the orders.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward White with Lehman Brothers.
Q - Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Thanks. Looking at the Silicon business for a moment, I think you mentioned that you have about 50 new products in the pipeline. Can you talk about the area that you'll focus on in terms of product market share in the Silicon business over the next year? What are the real goals and objectives as you look at 2007?
A – Mike Splinter: Sure, Ed. A couple of things I'd say about that. First and foremost, we want to continue to make progress in Etch. We've increased our investment there. We've increased the number of products we have in the pipeline there. So, that's a very important area to us because of the size and size of the overall market and the fact that we think that that market is going to continue to grow. The other area is that we're investing heavily in is inspection from our PDC unit. We're growing the solutions there in a number of products in applications we'll have out of that area. And then you can expect us to continue to invest across our broad array of products and renew all those. But then, we're expanding in display. And then we're going into solar area, which is going to require some significant new product ideas, concepts. And we right now have a number of new products coming up in that area that you've already seen a few of those but you'll see a few more of those as we go through the year. Those are our big equipment areas. But I don't want to shortchange our service area, where we have a lot of new service products and are efficiently developing those products as well. I think when you sum it all up, we're renewing our product line and expanding it at the same time, so that we really get the growth of the Company moving ahead with new products as well as our existing products.
Q - Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Okay. And then finally, with the growth prospects, at least in the first half of the year for the whole semiconductor capital equipment industry coming from memory, how do you feel about your position now with memory manufacturers? I know that was the focus to gain the share there. You've done that. Where do you think your position with them today? And does that need to be enhanced further as you go ahead?
A – Mike Splinter: We've made a lot of progress in 2006. We want to continue to enhance that in 2007 but it's no longer the major disadvantage it was for us in 2005. So, we're pretty happy with the excellent progress that we've made there in 2006. And Ed, as we move from really 90 to a buildout on 65 to technology buys on 45, we're gaining share in each one of those nodes. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Deahna with J.P. Morgan.
Q - Jay Deahna - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: A couple of questions. First of all, for the tax rate in Q1, should we be using a similar tax rate for the rest of the year? And then the second question is, if you look at the midpoint of your order guidance, it's down $200 million, so display accounts for all of that. So it sounds like the pickup in service orders and the dip in Silicon Systems is a wash. My question on that is, if that's a pause, do we see some sort of a dip in Silicon Systems orders before they turn up in order to drive that 6% away from equipment growth in 2007? And I presume you were talking calendar 2007 and not fiscal.
A – Mike Splinter: I was talking about calendar 2007 for the projection, Jay. But I don't think that we're going to see particularly anymore drop than what we're thinking about in Q1 because of our share movement. The thing I tried to express was that with our share gains, despite the fact that we think that the wafer Fab equipment spending will be up 6%, our Silicon business should be over 10% really in our fiscal year. I'm kind of talking about the growth in the market and the growth in our Company. As you know, we always mix those on calendar year and fiscal year.
Q - Jay Deahna - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: What's important in what you're saying, then, is that you really are talking about an incredibly mild pause. Because if that's what you're going to deliver and orders most likely, it sounds like you're saying they flatlined in April at worst, if I'm reading you correctly, that's not really even a downturn.
A – Mike Splinter: The way I'm looking at this is, there's really two things that are going on. One is, the foundry and logic guys are really in the downturn. In fact, I think they're approaching the bottom of the downturn in spending. Meanwhile, memories have continues increase investment as the bit growth has continued to expand at a very fast rate. When we look at their capex to revenue, we don't think it's particularly out of line because revenue is expanding and bit growth is so dynamic. So it feels like we almost have to separate these two trend lines from what's happening in memory and what's happening in logic and Foundry.
Q - Jay Deahna - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Right. Interesting. I was just wondering if the logic buildout, 65 nanometer for the industry including foundry, Intel at 45, that was going to start later in the year, that maybe you had a void as memory settled down and that came up. But it sounds like it's going to be rather simultaneous from your perspective with a little share gain.
A – Mike Splinter: Yes, I think that's the story.
Q - Jay Deahna - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: And the tax rate?
A – George Davis: Hi, Jay, it's George. The tax rate assumption of 34.5% is good for the full year. It does assume, though, that we have not got an extension of the R&D tax credit. So, if you see some legislative activity finally take place there, then that should impact 1% to 2% on the tax rate.
Q - Jay Deahna - J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.: Perhaps a congressperson from your district can help you with that.
A – Mike Splinter: We're working on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Q - James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thanks again for the segment detail. I find that really helpful. Mike, big picture question. If you go back from your experience in the industry, and I know you were at a different company, but just from an industry perspective back to the mid-90's. Before the industry recognized that there was kind of excessive DRAM capital spending that we weren't going to see again for another decade, we didn't see that coming. Why can't what's going on in NAND now be a repeat of that, from the standpoint of, you never see it while it's going on? It's only in retrospect that you realize there was an awful lot of excess capacity. And with pricing in NAND having been down a lot more in 2006 than we expected. And now margins in NAND being worse than margins in DRAM, there's no cushion for the NAND manufacturers. If the excess capacity sustains into 2007, these guys are going to have to take a more conservative approach with the capital spending. And how do we know we're not looking back two years now saying; "the 2005, 2006 period was a lot like the '95, '96 period in DRAM"?
A – Mike Splinter: You can look at this a number of different ways. What's been happening, the big growth has been going up at a very dramatic rate. And we've been trying to look at, NAND particular, at capex versus revenue. And it's nowhere near the '95 peak, which was, I think, almost 80% capex to revenue numbers back then and it almost hit that high again in 2000. I think the key here is; do the applications and do the bit growth continue? So far they have and the excess demand has been able to be absorbed by pricing declines. And I think as you know, the last, I think, four months or so pricing on NAND has flattened out and even up slightly in the past two months.
Q - James Covello - Goldman Sachs: But if I can interrupt for a second, the difference between last year and this year is that there was a lot of cushion in NAND margins starting 2006. That cushion has been arbitraged away, as we've gone throughout the year because margins have come down so much because pricing has come down so much. There is a ramification of the elasticity. You cut prices, you cut margins. And there's no margin leeway or cushion as we enter 2007 to see the kind of price declines that we had in 2006 and still continue to spend on the capital spending.
A – Mike Splinter: Well, then you have to look at who's actually spending and so we know that there are big companies here. But they're moving very fast to the next generations of technology, which give them, again, a lower cost per bit and are moving as fast as they can to preserve those margins.
Q - James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Terrific. One quick follow-up and then I'll go away. On the stock buyback, did I understand you said no buyback in January but resuming in April? And if I got that right, how come no buyback in January?
A - Nancy Handel: The buyback is a result that the agents that we had completing the ASB in the market. So, we're going to wait and turn our repurchase program back on in Q2.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Q - Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay, great. Thank you. The commentary you gave about fiscal 1Q flat panel orders being down about $200 million. Is this due mostly to one customer or is it spread basically evenly across multiple customers? And as a follow-up to that, how do you see the flat panel display spending for 2007 trending after this record year in 2006?
A – Mike Splinter: So, it's in part due to a couple of things. One, we have very strong orders in Q4 and so it's coming down off a high. So one big customer placed their Gen 8.5 orders in Q4. And I think you know that there are two other manufacturers that are in a state of reassessment. One in Korea, one in Taiwan, one due to a merger. So, I think we're kind of in a wait and see mode on flat panels. The estimates that we look at say down roughly 20% on the year. But when I look back at a year ago, we also said that it was going to be down 20% and then after great sell-through during the holiday period through Chinese New Year, the orders picked right back up and we had a terrific year. But right now, we're thinking that the spend in the industry is going to be down 20% year-over-year.
Q - Stephen Chin - UBS: And if I could take a second question. So you've made some comments about spending in the equipment market being up about 6% and you called out some specific market share gains that you've had, Mike, in some of the thin film groups and in the Etch segment. Do you think some of those market share gains there will let you outperform some recovery in the industry faster than prior cycles, given the strength you're seeing here in 65 nanometer and 45 nanometer?
A – Mike Splinter: Well, yes, we think so. Anytime you change the profile of your Company, which we've pretty much been able to do in getting into much better position with a memory manufacturers, it allows us no matter who's spending the money now to move a little faster than the market and have much better balance than we previously have.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with Morgan Stanley.
Q - Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon. First question for Mike. If I look at the EDA companies or the chip design software suppliers, they're currently tracking about anywhere from 250 to 365 nanometer chip design starts. And many of these designs are being done by the major fab with semi companies. And I think most of these design starts today are going to be resulting in tapeouts sometime middle of next year. And so given that and given your commentary about sort of the foundry spending in the second half of the year, I just wanted to get your thoughts about what your foundry customers are saying about 65 nanometer in 2007?
A – Mike Splinter: If I look back six months or a year ago, we expected them to be running a lot more 65 nanometer than they are today. So they're already in a delay mode on 65 nanometer. But the real question is, when do the big volume designs get into high volume production? That's the real question. At two of the major foundries right now, the 65 nanometer lines are not full. So I do expect new designs to come in and for those to start filling up the lines in Q2 and then on through the year. And they're going to make investments along with that. I think you probably have the data on foundry utilization at this point projected to be in the middle to low 80's for this next quarter. So that's not a point where they're going to be making aggressive investments.
Q - Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks. And then just one other question, if I may. Looking at the overall possibility of the business, just wanted to know the percentage of your R&D workforce that are located in low-cost geographies currently and how you see that growing over the next one to two years?
A – Mike Splinter: So today, we have about 1,000 people in those regions in Bangalore and Xi'an China. We'll increase that a bit over time but our main R&D centers are going to remain in Santa Clara and Rehovot, Israel and Horsham.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
Q - Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi, Mike. Maybe if I can just run for a second here with your scenario on the downturn. I'm not sure that I agree. But if memory is down, just as logic and foundry picks back up, just like it argues that there's not much of a downturn, it also argues that there's not much of an upturn. And if you look at your business and you look at the stock, you spent about $5 billion on acquisitions and on buybacks during the last 12 months and the stock hasn't really gone anywhere. So, if the same downturn scenario argues that there's not going to be much of an upturn, what's going to make the stock go up? The kind of big picture question here is, if you look at your competitors, they're kind of looking at the business and they're eliminating product lines that have lower margins. And I'm wondering, could we see a shift in your strategy?
A – Mike Splinter: So the question is, Tim, about strategy. But first of all, I don't think what we said was anything about a memory downturn. And we're still expecting memory to be strong for the foreseeable future. Of course, if the way it plays out is memory goes down when foundry goes up, there won't be much of a downturn but there won't be much of an upturn either. We're always looking at our products that don't meet our profitability objectives, believe me. And trying to understand either how to get them healthier or how to disposition them out in other ways. So I don't think that that's necessarily a new strategy, that's just taking care of business. But we are really looking at being strong on portfolio management in the Company. I think that's a key part of our overall strategy.
Q - Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Well, to that point, do you think that, given all the money you've spent the last four quarters and the fact that the stock hasn't really gone anywhere; do you think that maybe we have to rethink the business and rethink some of the segments that you're actually in?
A – George Davis: Let me just say, this is George. Let me make a comment about the investment as you're describing it. I think number one, we need to separate the activity for the balance sheet and the investments in M&A. The balance sheet activity is really a reflection of returning excess cash on the balance sheet to our stockholders. And that's a decision that I think we're comfortable that our investors are encouraging, just as they're encouraged by a higher dividend. And we believe that our cash needs are in the $3 to $4 billion range going forward and we're positioned well for that now. On the M&A front, we are in an investment mode and I think if we could find more opportunities like Applied Films, we would do them in our current business model. We have, through this process significantly strengthened our PVD capability in flat panel and in solar. And we've brought new technologies and flexible electronics. So we're comfortable that we have to at times invest and go through an investment period, which is really what we're experiencing through 2007 with Applied Films. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Pelayo with HSBC.
Q - Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Sorry about that. Just some clarification, first of all. I'm looking at your assumption for growth, about 10% in the Silicon business. I'm looking at it relative to the composition of what you just showed your break out. About 2/3 of that was your Silicon business. About 20%, 25% service business. And then your expectation for flat panel to be down about 20%. If you roll those up, based on the kind of composition that we saw for this last quarter, you're thinking that Applied Materials can grow more than 10% net year. Now, then we've got to talk about; well, what's the profile in 2007? You said you didn't expect to see much more of a drop. If you're talking about 10% growth in 2007, that's like an incremental $1 billion versus the $9.5, $9.6 or you're doing this calendar 2006. So, can you talk a little bit about the profile of 2007? And then I just have one more follow-up question.
A – Mike Splinter: I think you have it pretty close to right, Steve. We expect our service business to grow substantially faster than 10%. Silicon business to grow 10%. And our display business not to decline as much as the market. We're positive on 2007.
Q - Steven Pelayo - HSBC: So essentially, you're saying that growth resumes starting in your April quarter?
A – Mike Splinter: Yes.
Q - Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Okay. And then my last follow-up was, congrats to Nancy and George on the $0.40 per share in free cash flow. That's great. What's your expectation for Q1? Can you pull more from the working capital counts? It looks about $400 million, excluding the working capital counts, so that would be pretty good.
A – George Davis: In terms of free cash flow generation, we're at about $2.5 billion. We've been generating plus or minus, right around $500 million. And so I think you can kind of scale it down a little bit from there.
Q - Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Okay. And your expectation for share count in January, that's my last question?
A - Nancy Handel: It should be on the order of what we have now, maybe a few for the stock option activity or whatever but we won't be doing any buybacks.
A – George Davis: So we're at about $1.48 billion.
Q - Steven Pelayo - HSBC: I just didn't know what the timing of the last buyback, if the weighted average worked out, it actually went lower again next quarter. Thank you, I'll model flat.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Bachman with Pacific Crest.
Q - Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: I would like to go back to that last question, George. I think that Steven was onto something there. Didn't you buy back at the middle of the quarter and shouldn't you have a lower share count in January?
A - Nancy Handel: We did do a buyback at the middle of September and I think they're looking at a projected share count here of about 1.4, 1.3 maybe something like that. It was down a little bit or so from the year end here.
A – George Davis: I'm sorry, I gave a year end number. My apologies.
Q - Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: So we should be looking at 1.4, 1.3, is what you're saying?
A - Nancy Handel: Yes. Looking at it as reflecting the old quarter's worth of share versus the average over Q4.
Q - Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Perfect, thanks. Mike, can you discuss some of the share gains in your Etch segment? In particular, can you give us some qualitative commentary on both the dielectric metal and the poly segments, where you think you won and maybe where you might have lost?
A – Mike Splinter: Well, sure. I think that we've had strong metal, reasonably strong. I wouldn't say any of our segments are overly strong but we've been able to gain, particularly with the memory guys, coincident with our other efforts with the memory companies during this year. We started out stronger with the memory guys in our Etch area as well. So, what we've been working on in dielectric Etch, most of the gains have been in the less intense areas in Via(?) and Bondpad(?) opening, some of those areas. We're starting to win more in the dual damascene area, as we go through time. As our machines show good uniformity, better uptime, less cost of ownership, those are things that customers are particularly interested and are particular strengths of our machine. Our introduction in the Silicon area this year that pretty dramatically improved uniformity for gate Etch has helped us also quite a bit in the logic area.
Q - Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: When you talk about share gains, when the Gartner numbers come out at the end of the year, at the start of next year, should we be looking for share gains in each one of those segments from you?
A – Mike Splinter: It will vary, but, yes.
Q - Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Just one last question for Mike or George, whoever wants to take this. Any thoughts on not supplying order guidance going forward? Kind of along the same lines of what Lam has already done?
A – Mike Splinter: No, we haven't. We're not considering that at this time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Q - Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Two questions. First, I know that FPD was record for the year, but was the growth rate in FPD similar to the Silicon business? And the second question is, have the 45 nanometer decisions started to be made? How far long are we in that process? Because, you did mention that you expected to pick up more share there.
A – Mike Splinter: First of all, Brett, in the flat panel area, the growth there was very similar within 1 point or 2 of the overall growth of the Company. So it was pretty substantial and it really makes three consecutive record years for our AKT division. On 45 nanometer, of course it depends on the company, but the leading logic companies are already making major decisions here, have made a lot of the decisions on 45. The Foundry guys are in the process of making them. And the memory guys have a little different dimension but let's just say 50 to 55 nanometers, they'll be in the selection process here over the next six to nine months.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Q - Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you. Can you break down backlog by reporting segment as well?
A - Nancy Handel: No, we don't plan on doing that.
Q - Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Not in the 10-K either?
A - Nancy Handel: I don't think so.
A – George Davis: No.
Q - Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. And one other question. We've talked a lot about market share on this call, can you give us an update on where you think you are with respect to ion implants and market share?
A – Mike Splinter: Well, in our implant area, we haven't really been particularly happy with what has transpired this year but we continue to work hard in that area. It's one of those areas that we have a focused R&D program on. Our strengths are in beam purity and high dose implant. We're working to utilize some of our platform strengths in software and in robotics to help improve the productivity that we really need to enhance to be competitive there.
Q - Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay. You mentioned backlog adjustments of $97 million. Was that just the one customer, or was there some other dynamic here too with other customers?
A – George Davis: Steve, it was mostly normal puts and takes and then one large customer in the display area.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Maire with Needham.
Q - Robert Maire - Needham & Company: Congratulations to Nancy and George on future and past roles. And question, I seem to be hearing from people in the industry and other equipment companies of a shift in the memory segment away from flash to DRAM with the anticipation of the rollout of VISTA and such. And we've heard some manufacturers of that fungible capacity, perhaps moving capacity in that direction. First of all, I'd like to hear your comments on that, if you are seeing that reflected in the order book? And secondarily, related to that, would that perhaps soften any potential for excess capacity in the Flash market and where do you see capacity in the Flash versus the DRAM market?
A – Mike Splinter: I think there were a number of questions there, Robert. Let me see if I can comment on a few things. First on fungible capacity, this is a thing we've discussed with the customers quite a lot. The two major Korean DRAM manufacturers have varying degrees. One has a lot more ability to move from DRAM to Flash and back again. The other one has a small amount of ability to move. Most people, at the current time, DRAM manufacturers and those two companies that have the flexibility are moving more of their investments to DRAM in the current time, for the obvious reason of DRAM prices are holding. There seems to still be a shortage of supply and VISTA is coming and more DRAM's are going in cell phones. So all those things make you tend to think that DRAM's are going to continue to be strong for the foreseeable future. So, yes, we're seeing more DRAM play. But then there are pretty much peer play Flash manufacturers in Japan and the U.S. that are pretty focused on growing their Flash demand. So, we haven't seen them do any real changes at all.
Q - Robert Maire - Needham & Company: So the order book mix hasn't shifted over the last quarter or so?
A – Mike Splinter: Yes, it's moved more towards DRAM, particularly from those Korean manufacturers.
Q - Robert Maire - Needham & Company: Just a follow-on question, if I may. After this sort of flat couple quarter period we're talking about and the expectation of the foundries coming back, are the orders that you're anticipating coming back in spring of 2007, orders primarily to add capacity for the second half of the year normal seasonal rush of production? Should we be looking at this in more of a seasonal rather than a cyclical behavior?
A – Mike Splinter: It's hard for me to judge exactly how they're capacity and growth of their company is going to go, but the answer to their question is yes. That we've worked hard with them to shorten lead times so they can add capacity quickly. And we certainly think that that's the season, that they've been adding capacity for the last few years.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgerald with Bank of America Securities.
Q - Mark Fitzgerald - Bank of America Securities: Thanks. Given your outlook for the different segments in 2007, is there any implications for margin impact on the model?
A – Mike Splinter: No, not at this time. We see the mix affect being immaterial.
Randy Bane: Okay. Thank you very much. We would like to thank all of you for joining us in our discussion on Applied Materials financial results and outlook for the upcoming year. We would also like to remind you that a replay of this call will be available on our Website starting at 5:00 p.m. today and will be remain posted until November 30.

Reconciliation of these measures to GAAP measures are contained in our earnings press release issued today and in our Earnings Call Highlights documents, both of which are available on the investor page of our website. Nancy will lead off with a discussion on select financial results for Q3 and provide insight into the company’s initiative. After Nancy’s remarks, Mike will discuss current industry and company development followed by our fourth fiscal quarter target. He will then turn it back to Nancy and then we will go ahead and open the call to questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy, Nancy?
Nancy Handel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Randy. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I will discuss the results for the third fiscal quarter of 2006 and provide you with an overview of the strategic initiatives that enable us to continue delivering world-class operational and financial performance. During Q3, orders reached a near record level driven by continued strength in end user demand for integrated circuits and by increased customer requirements for advanced silicon and display solutions. Orders totaled $2.67 billion for the quarter, up 7% from the prior quarter with significant competitive gains as demonstrated by year-over-year growth in etch and process diagnostics and controls that was faster than the market. We also had stronger than expected order growth in our display products. Increased customer demand in memory and foundries drove slightly higher than expected order growth. Of our systems bookings this quarter, flash memory increased to 29%, DRAM was 24%, with logic and other at 27%, and foundries at 20%. Approximately 87% of systems orders were for our 300-millimeter, virtually all for 100nm and below process technology. Six orders were in excess of $100 million. Six orders were between $50 million and $100 million and 16 orders were between $10 million and $15 million. During Q3, 82% of our orders were from outside and North America. Demand from Japan, Southeast Asia and China, and Taiwan strengthened. Orders by major geographic areas were; Taiwan, 21%; Japan, 20%; North America, 18%; Korea, 15%; Southeast Asia and China, 16%; Europe 9%. Revenue for Q3 was $2.54 billion, 13% higher than last quarter exceeding our target. Revenue upside was driven by higher customer utilization rates and improved competitiveness in our silicon products and our display products. Backlog for Q3 increased to $3.32 billion compared to $2.93 billion for Q2 of 2006. Backlog adjustments totaled $264 million consisting primarily of the addition of $285 million of Applied Films backlog, offset partially by 20 million of customer cancellations. The majority of the cancellations were associated with 200-millimeter systems for flash memory. Reported gross margin for Q3 improved 160 basis points to 48.1% compared to 46.5% for Q2 of 2006. Improvements were driven by increased factory loading and continued progress on cycle time and material cost reduction. Equity based compensation charges reduced this quarter gross margin by 40 basis point. Operating expenses for fiscal Q3 were $540 million, 12% higher than last quarter. Operating expenses included increased spending for incentive, compensation program, and early investment in the company’s business transformation initiative, which we mentioned on last quarter’s call. Our continued focus on improving operating efficiencies possibly impacted both our gross margin and our operating profit. Operating income was $681 million or 26.8% of revenue, 180 basis points higher than the 25% reported for Q2 of 2006, with flow through 41%. Non-GAAP operating income was in line with our financial model, demonstrating increased operation and efficiency that enables us to funding our strategic initiative within the model. We exceeded our net income target for this quarter. Net income was $512 million or $0.33 per share compared to $413 million or $0.26 per share for Q2. These results included a benefit of $34 million or personally $0.02 per share from the resolution of audit of prior year’s tax filing, partially offset by an in process R&D charge of $14 million or approximately $0.01 per share associated with the acquisition Applied Films. Our financial model based upon non-GAAP matrix was developed to enhance understanding of ongoing operational performance. The model excludes items deemed by management to be unusual or nonrecurring. The reconciliation of our reported earnings per share of $0.33 to a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35 was included with our press release. The effective tax rate of 29.1% for Q3 was lower than the forecast rate of 31.5% primarily due to the resolution of audits to prior year’s tax filings. We anticipate the effective tax rate for Q4 to be approximately 32.2%. Now I would like to discuss some highlights of our balance sheet and cash growth. During the quarter cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased $672 million to $5.2 billion. The company used cash for its purchase of Applied Films, our investment in the Sokudo joint venture and for share repurchases and cash dividend. This was partially offset by cash generated from operation. Accounts receivable increased $345 million and day sales are standing increase slightly to 82 days. Inventory increased by $259 million basically due to $151 million of Applied Film. Capital spending for the quarter was $40 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $62 million. Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $332 million down from $471 million in the prior quarter. This decline reflects a $180 million estimated tax payment and other increases and working capital items associated with increased business volumes. We define free cash flow at cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The strong free cash flow and financial position enables us to continue our history of returning cash to shareholders by simultaneously reinvesting in our business. During Q3 the company repurchase 31 million shares of our common stock for $500 million at an average price of $15 to $30 per share since the beginning of fiscal 2005 the company has repurchase approximately 186 million shares representing approximately 11% of the shares outstanding at October 31st 2004 for cash outlay of $3.2 billion. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 we plan to repurchase shares in the range of $400 million to $600 million. In June 2006, the company declares the cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share payable on September 7th to stockholders a record as of August 17th. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 13,884 regular employees; the increase of 1,094 employees was primarily related to Applied Films’ acquisition. As part of our growth strategy we completed the acquisition of Applied Films for approximately $484 million or $328 million net of Applied Films cash. Applied Films is a leading supplier of thin film deposition equipment used in manufacturing flat panel displays, solar cells, flexible electronics and energy efficient glass. This acquisition compliments our thin film nano-manufacturing capabilities and provides an opportunity to expand into new high growth markets. At July 30th 2006, Applied Films had assets of $549 million including net accounts receivable of $15 million, inventories of $151 million, plant and equipment of $16 million, goodwill of $201 million, intangible assets of $140 million and other assets of $26 million. Also in this quarter we invested $147 million into our joint venture with Dainippon Screen called Sokudo. Sokudo brings together the complimentary resources and capabilities of screen and applied materials to deliver advanced technically differentiated track solution for customers’ critical semiconductor manufacturing requirement. Now I would like to conclude with our long-term strategic initiative that will enable us to continue delivering world-class operational and financial performance. These initiatives are designed to leverage commonality to achieve R&D productivity gains, improve engineering, manufacturing and sourcing capabilities and enhanced world-class management and organization capability. For example, we are driving material cost reduction and have instituted programs such as our recently expanded international procurement office based in Shanghai China to enable global material sourcing. In addition we are consolidating the direct material supply base to improve the company’s buying power, which has resulted in a 34% reduction in the number of suppliers from the beginning of the year. In manufacturing we continue to reduce cycle time through our integrate-to-order, module final test, and merchant transit program. Integrate to order is a combined business process and product design approach to reduce the order to ship cycle time for configured systems. Modular final test is a process that fully tests products in their modular form before they are crated and shipped eliminating the requirement for a system to be fully assembled, tested and then dismantled before transport. Merchant transit is a process of accumulating modules at an alternate site outside of the Applied Materials factory prior to shipment. In Q3 more than 80% of systems shipped were manufactured using the integrate-to-order process. And finally, we have launched our business transformation initiative, a multi-year global initiative to improve our business processes, replace multiple software assistance with a single enterprise system and streamline the sharing of real time operating data across the company. As you can see from this list of initiatives we are firmly committed to improving profitability. Our success is dependant on the outstanding contributions of our employees. I would like to thank our employees, for it is through their efforts that we will continue to deliver excellent results and extend our leadership in the industry. Now I’ll turn the call over to Mike, who will provide an update on our growth strategy as well his perspective on the market environment and the company’s strong strategic position. Mike will also provide the guidance for the Q4, Mike?
Michael R. Splinter - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Nancy. I would like to also add my welcome to all of you and thank you for joining us on the call this afternoon. My remarks are going to start with a review of our overall strategy, then move to discuss our Q3 performance and our current view of the industry, and finally our Q4 financial targets. Our activities in the Q3 demonstrate that we are making real progress on Applied Materials strategy. First, central to our strategy is growing in our core semiconductor business, both systems and services. While we have great opportunity to expand in multiple directions our technology leading products and new offerings are aimed at market share games particularly on the memory space, where we believe we have made excellent progress this year. Second, on top of this strong base we are entering adjacent and new markets that leverage our core competencies and provide opportunities to further grow the company over the long term. We will do this by aggressively pursuing organic expansions and through M&A activities. Finally, we will enhance our business processes and synergies working across the company to achieve operational and financial efficiencies that increase margins and deliver higher levels of profitability and returns for our shareholders. The near term goal of our growth strategy is to expand our opportunities and move Applied Materials from serving an addressable market of 17 billion back in 2004 to approximately 37 billion by 2008. We’ll do this by significantly expanding our core semiconductor business, enhancing our flat-panel display offerings, and initiating new solutions in solar and clean energy. Now let’s review our progress. In the quarter we saw significant sales increases throughout our business from core markets as well as adjacent markets. Revenue grew 54% over the same period one year ago demonstrating our ability to drive share through product innovation and bringing new technologies into the marketplace. We saw market share gains in etch, inspection, global services and across our thin film product line, and we continue to drive better returns across all of our products. Let’s look at the core product areas more closely. Leading up to Semicon we introduced Technology Solutions that will enable our customers to advance to the 45-nanometer generation. We’ve enhanced our advanced patterning films, one of the industry’s most successful emerging CBD applications. This revolutionary application allows customers the ability to cost effectively pattern nano scale features with increasing complexity while reducing their reliance on next generation lithography solutions. We also announced Sokudo, our joint venture with Dainippon Screen. We intend to make a significant difference in patterning by helping customers maximize lithography process window and improve overall litho cell economics, especially in high density chips like flash and DRAM. For critical device contact structures we introduced the Endura Integrated Liner-Barrier II system, which reduces resistance by up to 40%, the key element in increasing chip speed and improving power performance. We’ve also improved interconnect technology introducing active preclean on our Endura Cu Barrier/Seed system. This new process helps customers confidently transition to next generation low l films such as our innovative Black Diamond II. Our Endura Cu Barrier/Seed system is the tool of record for critical 45-nanometer development at all leading chip makers. In etch, we had a strong quarter growing revenue on pace with the rest of the company. In addition we are making progress on our strategic plan to expand our customer base and applications served. During the quarter we had strategic wins in key memory and foundry customers, with our industry leading advantage silicon and metal prowess. Another area where our products are showing strength is in the high growth non-flash market, specifically we made progress with RadOx, CMP and advanced patterning films. Here memory makers benefit from significant performance gains at a price that keeps memory affordable for the customers propelling that market. We are going to continue our efforts in this space to make memory specific applications and gain share in this critical market. Applied global services set a new revenue record. We made significant breakthroughs in our service agreements at major Asian manufacturers. We introduced our Metron Aquareus system for copper abatement adding to our leading range of innovative point-of-use abatement technologies and energy saving solutions that enable chip makers worldwide to meet their most stringent environmental goals. Uvision, our Brightfield inspection system with DUV laser 3D technology continues to gain momentum in line with our expectations. UVision is now installed at virtually every major customer. It has been winning repeat orders at customers in realizing the potential of rapidly finding nanometer-scale defects never seen before.  In terms of expanding into new markets we concluded the acquisition of Applied Films in the quarter. This acquisition integrates new capabilities into our flat-panel display group and positions us for further growth inline with our corporate objectives. Through this acquisition we now have an entrance into the PVD color filter area, which currently is more than $200 million market opportunity. It also provides key products and capabilities with the seller market as well as other applications. We are committed to achieving the promise of this acquisition and using our cross organizational capabilities in large areas of thin film processing to drive product differentiation and business efficiencies. Mark Pinto our CTO will be overseeing the integration efforts where Applied Films capabilities will be incorporated into our new business and new products group. The key to success here will be to quickly integrate the product lines and raise the gross margins to the Applied Materials expected range, making the acquisition accretive sometime late next year or in our early 2008. Now let’s turn to the industry outlook. In Q3 semiconductor environment with continued strong growth and overall unit demand particularly from memory products. Semiconductor industry continues to grow overall revenue in the 8% to 10% range year-over-year, but units are growing at a much faster clip greater than 20% this year. The flash memory units growing over 60% year-on-year, this is a very positive trend both for Applied Materials and the entire equipment industry. Further we are entering what looks to be a challenging period for equipment bookings as inventories are rising at our customers’ income segment and both foundries and flat-panel display companies reassess their investments. After an excellent record setting revenue quarter in our display division we expect to pull back in revenue of roughly 20% as major firms manage their capacity expansion plan. Meanwhile orders will stay relatively flat as a couple of the major players continue to pursue their 8.5 factories. Overall we expect this recess to be short lived as both the laptop and TV-end markets continue to expand at a very rapid pace. What we’ve heard from our semiconductor customers in recent weeks indicates that there is inventory building in the PC market affecting some customers’ outlook for wafer capacity expansion. PC story will be told over the next few months as we enter the back-to-school and holiday sales period. In the short-term, we see inventory growing in this segment, but we are also seeing manufacturers reacting quickly to ensure this inventory doesn’t continue to expand further. Foundries have maintained their cautious investment policies throughout the year. If we look at what foundries are expected to spend this year in equipment, it’s about $6 billion down about 30% from their 2004 peak levels. Foundries are demonstrating prudence and model flexibility and adjusting utilization rates to bring supply and demand back into balance. On the other hand, memory manufacturers have remained optimistic and even aggressive about their capacity expansion plans. Profitably in DRAM market segment improve for many manufacturers during the quarter, while business trends and outlook held strong. This has given these manufacturers continued confidence for investment. This confidence appears sound as new high content memory applications are due to ramp into the market place over the next year or so. Our customers’ investments in memory are aimed at capturing share for this fast growing market with growth likely driven by the advent of the instant on and platforms with Microsoft’s new operating system, Vista, for consumers next year. The memory manufacturers continue to drive investments in capacity with an eye on supply/demand outlook over the long term. In the current environment memory will continue to be over 50% of our revenue and bookings. Over the long term we remain optimistic. New Fab built plans expanded and we are now tracking 55 projects over the next two years. This level of plant capacity expansion is rational given the demand picture and if these projects stay on track next year it be a positive year for capital expanding in 2007. Our targets for Q4 reflect the current market dynamics and some cautiousness about the near term. We expect orders to be flat with a range of plus/minus 2% driven primarily by strength in memory orders. We expect revenue to be also flat within a range of plus/minus 2%. We expect EPS to be $0.29 to $0.30, which include an estimated $0.03 for equity-based compensation and approximately 1 penny for the dilution of AFCO and Sokudo. Looking past short-term issues, we are confident that many market opportunities are developing longer term. As such we are firmly committed to our investments and long-term initiatives that build on our core technologies and help us expand in adjacent markets. Building upon our current strength, these areas are expected to provide significant growth potential for Applied Materials. Going forward, we are confident about the driving forces of our business. We are gaining market share with new and better applications to meet our customers’ critical requirements. We are also growing our served available market and now have more opportunity for growth than at any time in our company’s history, and we expect our business process and efficiency initiatives will build on our performance and deliver new levels of gross margin and profitability over time. This was a strong quarter for Applied Materials, and our employees deserve thanks for their efforts in delivering the results you can see in our margin improvements and continued ability to deliver differentiated and innovative products to the industry. The events of this quarter demonstrate our ability to grow organically by utilizing our financial strength to expand the company for generating strong cash flow returns for our shareholders. Thank you very much. Now I would like to turn the call back over to Nancy for a moment, Nancy?
Nancy Handel: Yeah, thank you Mike. What I’d like to discuss is that on a personal note I’d like to announce to you today what I’ve been discussing with Mike and with the board and that is the fact that I will be retiring from Applied Materials that end of this calendar year after more than 21 years with the company. I have to say that; you know I have really thoroughly enjoyed my opportunity to grow my career at Applied. Particularly, this opportunity over the past two years to serve as chief financial officer and to lead a fantastic group of people around the world that make up our global finance team. I believe that I have done my best to position the company and the finance organization for continued success in our important strategic initiative and it’s now a good time to transition and really to focus and expand my longstanding interests in the non-profit community and to make a little bit of extra time for some fun. It’s been a great ride but we still have more work to do, we’ve got another quarter to close here and then some, so I appreciate your continued support and trust. So, now I would like to turn the call back to Randy.
Randy Bane: Thank you Nancy. Operator, we will now begin our question and answer session. We would like to entertain questions from as many callers as possible. As such, please limit your questions to one per firm. Operator, please begin with the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Jay Deahna with JP Morgan.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: Thanks, thanks very much and good afternoon. Mike, on the outlook for capital spending for next year, how much of it is dependant upon some fairly decent shipped inventory depletion between now and the end of the year, how do you feel about the prospects for that and if you look at the different segments, foundry flash processors and DRAM, how do you feel relatively on each one of those in terms of the outlook for next year. I think this still should be good for DRAM and may be some of the push outs and foundries might shift that into next year as they start 65 nm expansion, but I would love to get your thoughts on that, thanks.
Michael Splinter: Sure Jay, actually in point, so when we look at the CapEx for next year really what we feel that this is hinging on is how well the inventory gets drained during the -- this next six months because that will determine really what the first half of next year looks like. What we are seeing -- where we think the big issue is primarily in the PC space and not necessarily in DRAM related DC space but overall in the PC space so we want to watch a couple of critical areas, in particular the foundries are very important to us. One of the things that you can kind of assess from the call is that our orders from foundries for the upcoming quarter are projected to be pretty low, maybe in the 10% to 15% range. So how fast they are able to cut back on their starts and diminish that inventory is really the key for us. I think in flash memory, the players are going to continue to spend and put in the capacity that the longer term volume and applications are going to present themselves. I think the DRAMs are seeing an opportunity especially in Taiwan, are seeing an opportunity right now to make investments and grow their position in the market, so I am pretty confident that DRAM flash memory in general is going to be positive in 2007 and where they hinge back is in the foundries and some of the PC related IDMs, and that’s the thing to watch over the next few months on how those inventory trend as we see the sell through numbers in back to school and then in Christmas and Chinese New Year.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: Pulling it together, are you still expecting some level off of CapEx last year?
Michael Splinter: Well, I'm certainly less optimistic when it was three months ago Jay, but it really depends on what happens in the next three months and what happens in the foundries.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: Great thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon guys, thanks a lot. Couple of quick questions, Mike, could you talk a little bit about the kinds of pricing discussions you’re having at the end of the quarter with your customers particularly some of the customers in the memory space, who are seeing a little bit of squeeze in their margins and I will follow up after that, thanks.
Michael Splinter: Jim, really we have the -- pricing has been -- you can see a lot of the big deals that we made in the quarter; we really get to discuss through the quarter. I don’t think we really had any big gigantic exposure at the end of the quarter. So I think our pricing has been pretty steady for the whole year really and when you look at how stressed our factory was to make deliveries in this quarter, I think that this consistent to with that. So I wouldn’t say much about pricing and you see as reflected in our gross margin numbers. You know, you take that gross margin number apart a little bit and I think it indicates some pretty strong equipment gross margin.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Now to that and that was kind of my follow up question on the margins. If the revenue guidance is flat and EPS guidance is down a little bit, can you talk about the components that’s causing the EPS to be down a little bit?
Nancy Handel: The overall earnings outlook for the next quarter has obviously some unique items in it, one is the focus on the integration of Applied Films so, it will be the first time they show up and we have given an indication that the kind of impact that they might have on our reported earnings in the Q4. We also in light of the outlook for a revenue guidance and targets that Mike has discussed, you see that the factory loading should be sort of on par with what we had this quarter and so the efficiency gain that we have had in previous quarters now we are kind of leveled out a little bit in terms of the factory leading. We expect though to continue to gain some of the benefits that we have from our initiatives in our global sourcing and material cost reduction and some of the ones I described are modular final test and IPO. So we are putting an acceleration on bringing those benefits in, at the same time we get a little bit of the other opposite pressure from the integration and from the little bit of change in the pace of ramp for the business.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: I am sorry, just on that point, the factory loadings would be flattish though?
Nancy Handel: The factory loading should be flattish.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: So but if the factory loadings are flattish, I understand you’re not going to get a benefit from the factory loadings in out quarter, but that shouldn’t be a drag, I wouldn’t think and so the only delta between this quarter and next quarter would be the acquisition plus what else?
Nancy Handel: Well, there is a little bit of mix in there. In terms of our business between the panel business, the display business, as well as our AJS operation and our systems business. That’s not a huge factor in the coming quarter. In addition, we had good throughput through the factory in Q3 and now we have got a fair amount of product that’s going to ship in the first month of this quarter. So the factory loading was a little bit stronger in the Q3.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Okay, then just final question on that. If -- the flat panel typically has lower margin associated with it, so with sales being down in flat panel I would have thought that mix would have been positive a little bit?
Nancy Handel: Well, I think that the discussion around contribution is at the bottom line level with the panel business. I mean the display business area really contributes strongly at the bottom line so it wouldn’t have been a big impact on the earnings per share.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward White with the Lehman Brothers.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Hi, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the outlook from sort of the non-foundry IDM logic you know both the PC side and the non-PC side in this environment. And you talk a little bit about the memory been strong foundry been weak, but if you look at the, you know, the logic IDM, how are they looking?
Michael Splinter: Thanks for your question; it again kind of divides along the products segment lines. We still see that those companies that are making DSPs for instance or communication products are still doing quite well and will continue their expanding on track. The race in the processor space is still the -- you know the two major companies that have been going along, both I think are tightening up a bit, but they are going ahead with their expansion as far as we can tell and then kind of the other spot is in Japan, where we still have a fair number of IDMs, various types and from our results you can see Japan is still quite strong and we expect them to continue to make investments across the next couple of quarters.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and then one quick follow up. Nancy, you gave the percentage of revenues for integrate to order, but can you give some sense as to where it might be for modular final test and merchant transit. So can you give some idea as to how pervasive that is in your revenue mix?
Nancy Handel: We are making great progress, but those two initiatives are a little bit earlier in their life cycle than the integrate to order and actually the integrate to order, success is almost the precursor to the ability to do the modular final test and their emerging transit. So they should begin to continue to increase their contribution to our profitability, but they are a little bit further in the pipeline than the IPO is.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great thank you.
Michael Splinter: Thanks, operator?
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Thank you, good afternoon. A couple of questions, first, you mentioned the lower cycle plans, what are they now? What have they come down from and where can they go and can you comment also on the utilization of your Austin manufacturing facility?
Nancy Handel: The cycle time -- let me see if I’ve got a fact here. The cycle time have reduce significantly, overall cycle time is down to 100 days we keep trying to pull that down a few days at that time in terms of our build, you know basically order to customer fulfillment cycle time. In terms of our Austin factory you know we’ve really been able to get the utilization at a higher level they are -- although certainly we still have capacity in our Austin manufacturing side that is available for use. One of the things that I think is important is that you can look at how we’ve been able to be productive in our Austin site that we’ve put revenue through there that was incomparable to the kind of revenue that we saw in the year 2000 on a quarterly basis, some of our quarters in there and we basically get it with a third as many people. So we’ve got a high degree of productivity in our Austin site and it has got some additional capacity available to it, but it’s really running at a higher level of efficiency.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Okay, and one follow up. How should we be looking at operating expenses over the next quarter?
Nancy Handel: The operating expenses in the next quarter are going to be -- they are going to up, the addition of Applied Films certainly just kind of drops right into that line item although it drops into many elements of the profit statement but it’s going to be a contributor to our increase there. We also have some initial investment that continuing in our business transformation initiative, we’ve talked about that, that ultimately is a investment that would be capitalized but some of these early dollars during the design phase are part of the expenses so, we are driving everyone to look at the budget in terms of efficiency and manage that project tightly but there is a few dollars that would come into the operating expense line.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thank you so, when I look at your July revenues, are there AFCO revenues in there?
Nancy Handel: No, there were not. The transaction closed at the end of that period and they will appear in our Q4 for the first time. The balance sheet came on at the end of July but the P&L statement will come in during Q4. The result -- impact and that was in process R&D right off that was noted in the supplemental schedule with the press release.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay, could you help quantify those a little bit for October for AFCO?
Nancy Handel: Well, its going to come in -- very significant changes that are occurring with the way that we will recognize the revenue and the profitability for Applied Films, they previously had a revenue process that was percentage completion and our revenue process is really either revenue at shipment for standard products or revenue at sign off and so they will be making changes to our revenue process which is going to basically in the near term reduce the revenue at the same time near expenses are still coming in as an incurred basis so there going to be a little bit of a dampening effect and that’s why we call them out on the targets that we gave for the quarter.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: And, Nancy a quick follow up. If I look at your average memory orders year to date, it looks like they are up almost 100% from last year’s levels. Seems like that’s a lot more than CapEx, which is up about 30% or so. Is it -- what's really driving the faster growth rate in orders versus CapEx that you’re seeing from customers front-loading their orders and are you seeing backlog growth as a result of that? And more specifically if you’re looking beyond the October quarter, should we expect these orders to pull back more sharply because of these factors?
Michael Splinter: Satya, I’ll take the question. One of the things that we’ve been trying to emphasis really since the big spending shift of 2005 towards memories is our applications and share in the memory space, so we’ve been reasonably successful this year at gaining footholds and manufacturing tool of record at most of the memory manufacturers both for specific new products that we are offering as well as some of the existing products that we’ve already introduced for logic that now as the memory guys shrink dimensions are really important. So, most of the run ahead of the growth in CapEx and memories by the memory makers is share gained. Now, I itemize some of those applications I don’t want to go over and again here but what we should expect after October, I still think the memory guys are going to continue to invest. They see their opportunity and see the growth for the applications they are making, you can see how strong the DRAM pricing has been over this year. I think we’re probably all surprised at how strong that’s been this year and it’s given incentive to those memory makers to continue to grow their capital and grow their capacity. Operator?
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Chin with UBS.
Steven Chin - UBS: Thank you. I want to just go back to the guidance, I think I heard you said that the flat panel orders would be flat orders, if that was the case is it fair to assume that the systems bookings are going to be up more on your --perhaps 5% to 10% quarter-over-quarter? And you know, the other remaining category services typically seasonally down in Q4, is that a fair assessment?
Michael Splinter: Well I think it’s certainly a fair assessment. We gave you the information about flat panel revenue being down, orders will be flat. You know, our services both the revenue -- we expect services revenue and orders to kind of move up modestly in our Q4. Of course in Q1 services moves up -- orders move up quite a bit more but I think you can draw the conclusion between our semiconductor segment and our flat panel segment. I think you know, beyond that I don’t think there is that much differentiation.
Steven Chin - UBS: Okay, thank you.
Michael Splinter: Next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon. Mike, given the number of new areas that you’ve moved in the service side of the business, do you think that the service side of the business if we get into a little slower period here will have the effective -- finally having some offsetting impact on your revenue line relative to the equipment or it still you know, small when the piece of the business is slower and up growing piece of the business is that equipment is going to dominate the revenue pattern.
Michael Splinter: Well, Brett, I think you have studied pretty closely what's happening in our service business and percent of revenue now is up close 25% of our overall revenue and certainly that’s quite different than it was three of four years ago when it was in the low teens, so that as a percentage of our overall revenue, it’s double. Equipment both in flat panels and in semiconductor is still the major part of our business though and while we are better buffered against that sever downturn I don’t think there is anything that we can do or hope to do in the short term, that saves us from having to take appropriate action if there is a severe equipment downturn that Applied Materials has been through this kind of ups and downs before we have a pretty good formula for cutting back on spending, we have a variable workforce, we’ve been moving a lot elements to Asia to ensure we are best -- are best possible efficiency. So I think the summary, yes our service business is growing, it’s a better buffer but it’s certainly not a gigantic buffer.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Great, thank you.
Michael Splinter: Good day.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi Mike, two things. I guess first of all, if you kind of look at the industry on two broad matrix, if you look at you know, chip capacity utilization and you look at that relative through true orders and you also look at something like, you know equipment orders per chip being produced, if you just look at two really broad matrix like that. We have a situation that we had in 2000 or 1996 and both of those ended pretty badly. So I am wondering do those two you know matrix kind of from a really top level perspective worry you, in terms kind of how long a down turn be it in January or be it in April could be and what actions are you potentially taking that could mitigate that? Thanks.
Michael Splinter: So, of course there was indicators concern as the, and we watch them. I think one of the things that different in this go around you know, if you think that you are familiar with the ‘96 situation, as another memory situation but the situation today is quite different than that in that the number of applications is expanding so much for the various types of memories whether it’s in cell phones, growth in density and cameras etc, etc. So I think the foundation, the ability to grow and have that capacity go into real applications where there is real need, is much different the ‘96 and certainly different than 2000, where you know the underlying demand was quite false and I don’t feel like underlying demand in this particular situation is way off that. So I think that’s the big difference. As far as actions inside the -- if you’re saying actions inside the company where very much looking -- its kind of one foot on the gas, one foot on the brake. We want to make sure we are capturing every opportunity we can. But we also want to make sure we are controlling our spending especially our spending growth. We’ve controlled our headcount and we watch our temporary workforce. These kind of things that really allow us to scale back our spending quickly. What we would not be willing to do is compromise our growth initiatives and efficiency initiatives for the future because those are the future growth of the company.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Mike thanks. I guess just on that point, is there some change which actually to be you know, operating model. I think before you said that, you know $2 billion operating margin should be about 26% and you know net margin would be about 19%. So with the investments in solar with AFCO, has there been there any change in that model?
Nancy Handel: I would like to just -- you know comment that. We really are working on looking at refreshing the model. This model has been out here since the summer of ‘03 and you know we are looking through at our initiatives in the solar and the new business areas. We are looking at the time frame for bringing AFCO into our kind of profitability model. We’re looking at the contributions from our display business and also just some of the realities now of the tax rate changes that have occurred, our old model had a lower tax rate than we are dealing with now. So the team here is actually working on refining the models during this Q4 as well as working on the disclosure of material that we’re looking at in terms of how we are going to describe our business going forward, so we are trying to make sure that we have integrated those to ways of looking at the business and at the end of the quarter we come out with a new view we can share with Wall Street.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Stuart Muter with RBC Capital Markets.
Stuart Muter - RBC Capital Markets: Yeah thanks for taking my question and good afternoon. Following up on some early questions about service, I’m hearing you are making good progress on spares and consumables. Could you talk a little bit about the profitability trend in service, how that’s played out this year and how you see it going forward?
Michael Splinter: Actually this is a good point. In our service area we’ve seen growth and profitability at every quarter this year it’s -- I’m sure it’s an all-time Applied Material size, but it’s certainly the recent time highs they have gain about a point, a quarter on the gross margin line in our service area.
Stuart Muter - RBC Capital Markets: Excellent thank you.
Michael Splinter: Thanks Stuart.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robert Maire with Needham.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Yeah just a clarification the order number reported did not include AFCO but the order guide is going forward includes AFCO?
Nancy Handel: Yeah that’s true. The orders number for this quarter there wasn’t any AFCO in the orders or revenue for this quarter.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Okay, so if I back out the AFCO in the orders, would that suggest that orders minus AFCO or core Applied Business is down 5% in orders --?
Nancy Handel: No, that would be an incorrect assumption. AFCO really is -- with their, you know timing at their business practices, I think we’ve reflected them put it in our plus and minus 2% that we’ve given in terms of how that orders come in.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Okay, so they are not accounting for more than 2% of your business because you know it’s kind of like we are comparing apples and oranges and not understanding that.
Nancy Handel: It’s relatively small contribution in terms of orders and revenue in Q4.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Okay.
Nancy Handel: The guidance is really you know considered around the core Applied Material’s business that we have been reporting throughout.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Okay, but it doesn’t -- but the forward guidance for orders doesn’t include AFCO in part of that number?
Nancy Handel: Yes.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Okay and would that be a more significant percentage going forward you are indicating that there is some timing thing here with AFCO or --?
Nancy Handel: Yeah we would expect this business to continue to increase we also expect its possibility to continue to improve as we are able to go in and get some of those synergies that we are part of the desirability of computing acquisition. So as we say that when we did the acquisition that we expect you know, by the beginning of a way we should be seeing some contribution from AFCO going forward, but we’ve got a little bit of work to do in the near term.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Any earnings guidance has no -- AFCO have no significant impact on that I would imagine.
Nancy Handel: Well that’s a comment we made about the $0.01 per share that were part of my comment that Applied Films coming in now in Q4 with the change in revenue package that would be relaying revenue into the future and the fact that their operating expenses are here today that’s why we know that they could have almost a penny or so kind of impact on our Q4.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Okay and one last clarification. Given that the significant piece of their business is flat-panel related you just said that you expect their orders to increase, but flat-panel is sort of weakening here. Is there something different about their business in the near term versus Applied flat-panel business?
Michael Splinter: Well, one thing Robert -- one thing I think you may have noticed watching AFCO or Applied Films during this last quarter is that they got a significant order and solar market order I think was published at $30 million or so. We expect the penetration there to continue to grow over the upcoming quarters.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Okay, so we are all set flat panel weakness, perhaps -- okay, thank you.
Michael Splinter: You bet, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh with CIBC World Markets.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Hi, Nancy, congratulations of returning, I’ve got a quick question. I realized that the model is under scrutiny here but looking at the ones and dilution from AFCO and Sokudo next quarter, I mean if you look at revenues flexing down from the January quarter and if you kind of try to assess with the downside risk near-term is in terms of dilution from these two businesses assuming the timing is pretty tight and you can’t really do anything about the current cost structure, what's the ultimate sort of downside risk in terms of EPS solution from Sokudo and AFCO, let’s say prior trough levels in these two businesses.
Nancy Handel: Well I think that -- you mean just specifically related to them?
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Yeah, like if it cherry pick like the two recent troughs for both respective businesses whatever they might be, what does it mean in terms of EPS solution to the model for near-term?
Nancy Handel: Well I’ll look at the horizon that we got projections for the business and their impact on our business is really it will improve overtime but a kind of impact they are having on us today I think really represent sort of the downside for them. This is kind of the stage where their revenue is you know, maybe at its point where it’s been adjusted for our revenue cycle and their expenses having then you know, brought in line with our financial model, yes, so I think the kind of impact that we are talking about now should represent the downside for them.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: I mean so you are saying, Nancy, that really shouldn’t be modeling much more dilution than a penny a quarter over the next two or three quarters let’s say if revenue start to go down?
Nancy Handel: I don’t think so, I guess they will have to see what the impact of the action was but we really think we’ve got the business targeted to be a creative beginning in a way. So we should be able to move in that direction during ‘07.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay, so no matter what happen the worse case scenario for the two businesses in terms of EPS solution for the full year of ‘07 is like $0.04 to $0.05?
Nancy Handel: I think that’s a good place to start.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay, all right, great thanks, Nancy.
Michael Splinter: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Okay, sir, and your final question comes the line of Michael O'Brien with Bear Stearns.
Michael O'Brien - Bear Stearns: Yeah, thanks. I’m just curious like on the memory side of things you know, you’re saying it continue to be strong you know, is every one right now you say is spending at the same time, more staggered, I’m just trying to get an idea of how likely we are going to see you know, peak in memory even if memory demand -- if they all take a break in the quarter. And then with respect to your severe downturn you know, which you talked about and you are a little less confident in 2007, I mean when do we start seeing that flow through? I mean it sounds like if this isn’t as bad as it get, plus or minus 2% that’s not so bad.
Michael Splinter: If all -- you are right, Michael, and all I get is plus or minus 2% that’s not so bad but you know, our industry generally has bigger swings than that. You know, the memory spending, when you just go talk to these guys they are almost to a person or to a company, very bullish right now about their opportunity -- either about their new term opportunity in the DRAM area or about their longer term opportunity in the flash area and they are willing to push through the clear pricing pressure there is today in the flash memory space, so pretty much everyone of those memory guys has a new Fab on the books and is in one stage of ramping it or another. So, I think this thing kind of keeps cycling on pace unless somebody loses their courage. On the severe down turn scenario, again the timing from -- if you question may be I don’t quite understand the question but if your question is what's the timing kind of from seeing an orders down turn to seeing a revenue impact, today in our industry is very fast because throughput times are fast, our backlog is -- it doesn’t extend very long like it used to when the cycle times were much-much longer. So, the timing from orders to impact is very short, three, four, five months kind of impact.
Michael O'Brien - Bear Stearns: That was kind of my question, but if I kind of look at the you know, you are saying the memory guys almost to a company are still quite still bullish so -- and the foundries are already -- in a pretty negative scenario for October, Intel and others were pretty low levels. I am just trying to see here in the near term, what's going to take that for that step -- step function down in orders?
Michael Splinter: The thing I believe that -- in order to see a big step function down, the foundries have to continue their kind of negative bias on capacity and the memory guys have to have some kind of an advance that doesn’t -- that takes away their courage for investment and I think that when you look at the various players if it was going to happen, it would happen in the DRAM space before it happens from the flash guys.
Michael O'Brien - Bear Stearns: Okay thanks good luck.
Michael Splinter: Thanks. I think that was the last question and I just wanted to finish off by saying thank you to Nancy and acknowledge her 21 years at Applied Materials in making a huge impact on our company through the good times and the bad and she has done all different kinds of jobs in management and demonstrated leadership across the company. So Nancy, thank you and thank you for your contributions. You’ll be thoroughly missed. Thank you.
Nancy Handel: Thank you.

Today's call will begin with an analysis of the second quarter financial results by Nancy Handel followed by Mike Splinter, who will provide an update on the industry environment and Applied's strategic position. Following Mike's comments, Nancy will provide third quarter 2006 financial targets. We will then open the conference call for questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Handel. 
Nancy Handel: Thank you, Randy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I will cover the results for the second fiscal quarter of 2006. During the second quarter, strengthening demand for integrated circuits, together with customers' requirements for advanced nano manufacturing solutions, resulted in higher orders. In addition, our continued focus on improving overall efficiency is yielding strong financial performance.  Finally, it is most important to recognize that our employees have made us the leader in our industry due to their commitment to delivering innovative products and services that enhance customers' productivity. I would like to thank them for achieving these excellent results.  Highlights for the second quarter included outstanding order performance and a 21% increase in revenue, flowing through to gross margin at 53%. In addition, we continued to deliver strong cash flow and return value to our stockholders.  For the second fiscal quarter, orders of $2.49 billion surpassed our target and were 22% higher than for the first quarter of 2006. Revenue for the second quarter was $2.25 billion, 21% higher than the last quarter, and exceeded our target. Operating income was $561 million or 25% of revenue, compared to 8% for the first quarter of 2006. Net income was $413 million or $0.26 per share, compared to $143 million or $0.09 per share for the first quarter.  Results for the second quarter included equity-based compensation expenses of $55 million or $0.03 per share and a net benefit of $2 million associated with facilities realignment programs. Of the $55 million in equity-based compensation expenses, $9 million was reflected in gross margin and $46 million in operating expense. Excluding these items, the Company would have reported net income of $453 million or $0.29 per share.  Reported gross margin for the second quarter was 46.5%, compared to 45.1% for the first quarter of 2006. Equity-based compensation programs decreased this quarter's gross margin by 0.4%.  Increased customer demand drove higher than expected order growth. In the quarter, DRAM orders represented 27% of silicon systems orders, flash memory orders were 24% and foundry orders were 17%. Logic and other orders comprised the remaining 32%.  300 millimeter orders represented approximately 73% of total systems orders, and 74% of the system orders were for 100 nm and below process technology. Six orders were in excess of $100 million. Seven orders were between $50 million and $100 million. 14 orders were between $10 million and $50 million.  Customers are continuing to build out 300 millimeter fabs, driving new levels of industry operating efficiency. By the end of calendar 2006, we expect 300 millimeter to make up about 20% of overall semiconductor manufacturing capacity, and we expect capacity buildouts to continue through 2007. With over 55 major fab plants in the works for high utilization and migration to new technologies, this is good reason for optimism.  During the second quarter, orders increased from customers in Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia and China. Orders by major geographic areas were Korea, 22%; Taiwan, 19%; North America, 18%; Japan, 17%; Southeast Asia and China, 14%; and Europe, 10%. Backlog for the second quarter increased to $2.93 billion, compared to $2.73 billion for the first quarter of 2006. Backlog adjustments totaled $46 million, consisting primarily of customer cancellations.  During the second quarter, broad-based customer demand created by rising fab utilization, investments in advanced technology, and our improved product position drove our revenue increase. Operating expenses for the second fiscal quarter were $484 million, relatively flat quarter over quarter. Our continued focus on improving operating efficiency is paying off with increased gross margins and operating profits.  The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 31.3% was slightly lower than forecast. We anticipate the effective tax rate for the third quarter will be approximately 31.5%.  Excluding the non-GAAP adjustments stated in our press release, Applied's return on invested capital would have been 53%. We define return on invested capital as operating profit after tax, excluding one-time tax benefits, calculated on an annualized basis, divided by the average invested capital, less cash, cash equivalents and investments.  We are pleased to report that our free cash flow generation for the quarter was $461 million. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. During the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased $30 million to $5.8 billion.  As of April 30, 2006, Applied changed the classification of certain investments from short term to long term. We believe this better reflects Applied's expectation of when such securities will be converted to cash. Prior-period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.  During the second quarter, the Company repurchased 28 million shares of our common stock for $500 million at an average purchase price of $18.16 per share. Since the beginning of fiscal 2005, the Company has repurchased approximately 155 million shares, representing approximately 9% of shares outstanding at October 31, 2004, for a cash outlay of $2.7 billion.  During the third fiscal quarter of 2006, we plan to repurchase shares in the range of $400 million to $600 million. In March 2006, the Company declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share payable on June 8 to stockholders of record as of May 18.  Accounts receivable increased over the prior quarter by $194 million and days sales outstanding was 79 days. Inventory increased by $60 million during the quarter. Capital spending for the quarter was $32 million, and depreciation and amortization totaled $66 million. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 12,790 regular employees. Mike will now provide his perspective on the market environment and the Company's strong strategic position. 
Michael Splinter: Thanks, Nancy. In the second quarter, demand for Applied Materials' nanomanufacturing technology was strong and broad-based. Our semiconductor and flat-panels systems business drove growth as product positions continued to strengthen. Our operations, sales and product teams did a fantastic job setting the pace in this ramp, producing excellent financial results.  I would like to discuss several key items today. First, Applied is expanding in our core business and winning new accounts. Our semiconductor systems business has outperformed the competition. We have outgrown each of our major competitors in etch, implant, thin films and inspection for the last two quarters; and we expect to continue strong performance through the year.  For example, our CVD business volume in 2006 is expected to set a new record, growing faster than the market, as our customers turn to new applications like advanced patterning films and strain engineering for device enhancement and to address the continuing increase in the number of metal layers with low-k dielectrics.  Our expertise in advanced technology is attracting customers to our solutions like RadOx, DPN and recessed epi for enhanced transistor performance. Our advanced solutions in CMP, etch and CVD are also high-growth areas now and in the future, as more of these capabilities are adopted by memory manufacturers seeking to improve litho performance and to increase their density of their flash and DRAM products. The effect of this can be seen with orders in these areas up over 80% in the last two quarters.  Second, we are extending our broad product portfolio and entering adjacent markets. We've done it by delivering new technology, like UVision, that opened up the brightfield inspection market for us last year. The formation of Sokudo, our strategic partnership with Dainippon Screen that we announced yesterday, expands our litho-enabling solutions by accelerating our entry in the track. You should expect more new products over the coming months, positioning the Company to continue to outgrown and outperform the industry.  Third, we have developed Applied Global Services into a world-class, diverse product business group that delivers strong growth that is built on our core business. AGS had record revenue and profitability this quarter as spares, refurbished equipment and our Metron products led the way.  AGS is introducing new products and we are making acquisitions like the one in Singapore we announced last week to expand our capabilities globally, particularly in the area of chamber performance services. We expect AGS to continue to grow and deliver new levels of profitability.  Fourth, we are looking long term, beyond semiconductor manufacturing, to access high-growth markets. We have built our AKT flat-panel product business group into a leader in its product area. Today, it is focused on only about 20% of the available market. We are taking steps to grow that total opportunity.  The planned acquisition of Applied Films expands our flat-panel business into the other major product area, color filter, and also opens the fast-growing solar photovoltaic market for us. These new businesses are built on the core thin film nanomanufacturing capabilities of Applied Materials, and in the future, they will generate additional growth. The new opportunities we have discussed in our core products, service, flat-panel and solar add to our served available market and add to the fundamental core market growth. It really represents what we mean by applying nanomanufacturing technology to areas where our core capabilities can change market dynamics and foster market growth by delivering improvements in cost and productivity of the end products. I am also pleased with the progress we have made in operational and financial performance. In everything from gross margin to cycle time, balance sheet performance to cash flow, we are delivering on our goal to make Applied Materials fast and flexible so that we can continue to operate our core business with excellence while adding new businesses.  Let me sum up by reflecting on the industry and then make a closing comment. In general, we see a healthy environment where the growth rate in electronics product demand is increasing. According to Dataquest, the $1.3 trillion global electronics market is expected to grow in excess of 7% this year. That is amazing growth on a base that big and represents fast-growing demand for cell phones, digital TVs, gaming PCs, MP3s and a host of other chip-powered products. We believe these products are fundamental in growing economies and will continue to grow ahead of GDP in years to come.  This demand is driving the need for increased semiconductor capacity and incremental equipment investments in order to meet that rising unit demand in the short and the long run. Our customers have spent rationally on capacity and maintain a very high rate of utilization with improved profitability. Because of this, new fab activity is up and producing new opportunities for us. From that perspective, the industry is healthier than it has been in years, and I am confident that 2007 will be a year of continued CapEx expansion.  We are strengthening Applied Materials to make it an even greater partner for our customers. I think it is fair to say that we have a larger set of opportunities in front of us today than we have had at any time in our history. Our employees around the world have done a fantastic job, and their focus, dedication and commitment is driving our ability to grow and grow profitably. Thank you very much. Now I will turn the call back over to Nancy for the Q3 forecast. 
Nancy Handel: Thank you, Mike. As we enter our third fiscal quarter, we remain focused on operational efficiency and driving margin improvement throughout the Company. We are also excited about the newly announced opportunities to expand our business. However, please note that the targets that I am about to give do not incorporate the financial implications of these proposed business combinations.  Our fiscal third quarter targets are orders up approximately 5% to 10% from Q2 levels; revenue up approximately 5% to 10% from Q2 levels; and earnings per share, $0.28 to $0.30, which includes an estimated $0.03 per share for equity-based compensation.  Going forward, we see memory remaining strong and foundry expected to be up in the third quarter. We should see growth across our nanomanufacturing technology product areas as we position Applied Materials to outgrow and outperform. With that, I will turn the call back to Randy so we can start the Q&A. 
Randy Bane: Thank you, Nancy. Operator, we will now begin our question-and-answer session. We would like to entertain questions from as many callers as possible. As such, please limit your questions to one per firm. Operator, please begin with the first question.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jay Deahna - JP Morgan.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan : Actually, Mike, in terms of the outlook, you indicated in your prepared remarks that CapEx should be up in 2007. Can you give us a sense as to what kind of magnitude you are talking about? Are we talking 10%-plus or up undefined? If that is the case, do bookings need to trend higher throughout the rest of this calendar year in order to get into that? The second part of the question is you laid out some of your strategic objectives. Is that your priority order? Organic, semi equipment, tool development, acquisitions and JVs, then service, then future markets? Or is it basically whatever the best opportunities are within those four that pop up, you hop on them?
Mike Splinter: Okay, Jay, thanks for the question. On CapEx in 2007, we are thinking around 10%, maybe high single-digits, up to 10% growth in 2007. We think that it will be a continued drive of consumer electronics causing the growth in electronics demand well ahead of GDP. Of course, the assumption is that GDP stays on track during that period of time. As far as the orders in the second half of the year, obviously, we are forecasting 5% to 10% up in the third quarter. We will talk about our fourth quarter later on, but in order to satisfy that CapEx spending in '07, you have to see some level of growth. On the strategic objectives, I will just lay them out for you. First of all, is to outgrow and outperform in our core business, number one. That is our first and foremost critical objective. Second is to run our Company operationally and financially at a world-class level, and then to grow the Company in new market areas.  So in that core area in the first objective, I include all our current businesses, service, AKT, and in the last objective, new markets that we might go into that we're not in today, some of those represented by the acquisition and joint venture that we announced during the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus : Thanks a lot. Just getting back to the orders outlook for second, you mentioned that memory was going to be strong and foundry was going to be up. In terms of the guidance, did you see any pull-ins this quarter that created the stronger 2Q '06 results and the outlook for 3Q?
Mike Splinter: Well, I think you can assume that customers are anxious at this point to get capacity online because they need to fulfill customer demand. So, yes, there has been some pull-ins, and we see that environment continuing in Q3. But it is not crazy. I think it is rational.
Patrick Ho - Stifel Nicolaus: A more specific question on the AKT business: do you see the potential order flow picking up in the second half of the year as some of these new next-generation fabs are built?
Mike Splinter: Yes, we do. Actually, our AKT orders were down in this quarter. I think we said that at the beginning of last quarter. So we expect orders to be strong in the second half of the year. So we expect it to be up fairly significantly in the last two quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch : On the Applied Services Group, you mentioned that spares were up, but on the services side, how does that growth track relative to the capital spending growth? Is that fairly independent based on installed base? Or is that also getting leverage from the capital spending cycle?
Mike Splinter: Services and spares are much more proportional to the utilization of factories. So service, of course, when you think about it, service does increase off our base business, because of the new equipment that gets out into the market. In any one year, it is a relatively small percentage of the total, but on a continual basis, we are building off the core and it continues to grow in spares and in service. Our refurbished equipment segment was also quite strong this quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Chin, UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS : A question on the geographies. The orders from the Southeast Asia and China region looks like they more than doubled. Mike, could you provide some more color on what happened there? Was it mostly for 200 millimeter bookings there, and was it one-time in nature? Is this level sustainable going forward, would you think?
Mike Splinter: Well, there was quite a bit of 200 millimeter, particularly from Southeast Asia and a bit in China. But that group overall we see to be continuing strength in Q3. So we think it is going to be maybe even a little stronger than it was in Q2. And Q2, as you point out, was roughly double from our projection in Q1.
Stephen Chin - UBS: If I could just follow up on the other big region in the quarter, it looks like the orders from Korea appear to have hit an all-time high, in my model. Do you think that level is sustainable going forward as well?
Mike Splinter: Well, Korea was quite strong in the quarter. DRAMs and flash continue to be extremely strong. Another factor here is something we've been talking about for some time, is the work we're doing on gaining a bigger share of the memory market. This certainly hurt us in 2005 and our product groups have been doing excellent in 2006 in gaining share. Also AKT, a big part of their sales is in Korea as well. So I think Korea is going to be a big market for us going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs : Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much. A couple quick questions. First, lead times, could you tell us what they are doing?
Mike Splinter: Not much change on lead time, Jim. There's a few minor spot of tightness in our supply chain. But we think we have been able to work through it and keep our lead times pretty firm.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Did they kind of go up and now they are coming back down? Or they just never went up that much?
Mike Splinter: They never went up that much.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs : And then on the acquisition strategy, it is certainly encouraging to see some product-related acquisitions and joint ventures that we have seen over the last couple of weeks, as opposed to the services acquisitions of the past couple of years. Did the announcements over the last couple of weeks sort of mark a shift in strategy? Or do you think the services acquisition strategy is still going to be part of the big picture?
Mike Splinter: Well, we try to use acquisitions to fulfill the overall strategy. We still think we have lots of opportunity to grow in service. Where there is opportunity to do an acquisition, we will. But obviously, these product-oriented acquisitions are much larger plays than we've done in the service group in the last couple of years. I think overall, you should take one other message, that we are working on getting better at acquisitions in both how to do them, how to value them, how to integrate them. I think that is part of our overall development here over the last few years.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike O'Brien - Bear Stearns.
Mike O'Brien - Bear Stearns: Maybe just give me a little more of what is going on with the foundries. I think you said foundries were going to be strong; is that across all of the foundries? Or is it just one or maybe two of them increasing spending more dramatically, while the others still have a foot on the brake?
Mike Splinter: Well, foundry spending was not particularly large in Q2. So their factories are full, or maybe in one case, still filling. We think that they have to start coming back in a bigger way in Q3. There are some signs that that is going to happen more across the board than certainly in Q2.
Mike O'Brien - Bear Stearns : That is through all the foundries? Or is it still a little bit more just one or two of them?
Mike Splinter: No, pretty much all the foundries have to make investments now as capacity is getting tight.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: A couple of questions. Can you give us a little color on the $46 million in cancellations? I think that was actually backlog adjustments, the majority were cancellations, you had mentioned.  Secondly, just one other region, Japan, orders were pretty strong. It looks like they were pretty volatile over the past several quarters. What do you expect going forward?
Nancy Handel : I'll offer the comment on the backlog cancellation. The majority of that was actually in one customer area, where there was a change in the product mix set that was going to be shipped. So when that happened, we de-booked or canceled the order, and a new order got booked in that case. So that wasn't anything particularly noteworthy there. The rest of it is fairly small miscellaneous single unit kind of activity. There is nothing particularly noteworthy.
Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank: And Japan?
Mike Splinter: Well, maybe I can just make a couple of comments on the direction of what we see and I will include Japan in this. On the next quarter, we are going to see North America down a bit; Japan will be up, Taiwan will be up, and we already talked about Southeast Asia and China. As far as Japan goes, Japan has been pretty strong for the last, almost two years now. Yes, they have some ups and downs, but I think most of that ups and downs are just part of the lumpy order pattern. If you average out the last two years, they have been about 20% of our order book. I don't see that changing going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thanks for taking my question. You talked about 2007 CapEx up potentially 10%. Can you give us a little bit more color as to what you are thinking in terms of which device segments are driving that CapEx? Secondly, are the acquisitions and JVs that you are making now going to contribute in terms of revenues in '07? And can you talk a little bit about how much you might potentially outperform the 10% number in '07?
Nancy Handel: I will take that second one first. The targets that we have issued do not reflect any financial input from the two activities that we have announced recently. As we announced during those calls, those are both expected to be mildly dilutive in the near term and expected to be accretive to our earnings beginning in '08.  So our expectation is that we will provide more color on our Q3 call about the impact of these business areas going forward. Mike, do you want to talk about '07?
Mike Splinter: Sure. Well '07, we expect a lot of the current trends to continue to drive from consumer electronics and the continued increase in flash memory utilization for various kinds of data storage. Those two things are going to be the lion's share of what is going to drive CapEx.  So you can take that to be the memory market we think is going to be continuing strong. Then the players and cell phones, MP3 players; it obviously means Japanese will be strong because of the consumer electronics and the other players that really feed that market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Maire, Needham & Co.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: In looking at your guidance, I'm trying to get a handle on how much of the 5% to 10% up is conservatism. Do you see a plateau here? Do you see some digestion of stuff that already out there, or is it primarily a mix shift? Can you help us out with the components of what is changing the order pattern here that gives you that kind of guidance?
Nancy Handel: Well, are you talking about orders or revenues? From our revenues, we are really looking for our business to be up across the board, with our service business and our flat-panel business and our core systems business that will be in that outlook.  Similarly, in our orders outlook, service business and flat-panel will be strong again here in the back half of the year, and the systems business should continue at a good pace also.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: So with orders being up 5% or 10%, given you are coming off a quarter that is up 22% in orders, is this just lumpy ordering that a lot of orders fell into the just-reported quarter? Or is it that you think there will be a little plateau or digestion period here? I'm just trying to get a handle on the dynamics.
Nancy Handel: Well, the growth area here, the mix will shift a little bit towards the service business. But the silicon business and the panel business will still be coming through strong.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: So would that imply that you would expect a reacceleration of order patterns in the second half of the year?
Mike Splinter: Well, Robert, as we said, we think 2007 will be a solid CapEx year. There's always ups and downs in this business. We have lumpy orders. But we think that in the 5% to 10% range on our $2.5 billion basis is still a pretty big number.
Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: Yes, it's a huge number. Is there some sort of a timing issue here where you're talking about 50 fabs or so being worked on. Are the timings similar? In other words, these are not paced or laid out through the year, or most are in a similar mode right now that contributed to a lot of orders falling into the quarter?
Mike Splinter: One other thing you have to remember is there was a strength in 200 millimeter orders because people were filling up some of their older 200 millimeter fabs to fill the demand for the likes of LCD drivers, etc., that use N -1, N -2 capacity. And once those are full, there's no place else to go except the 300 millimeter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri, Citigroup.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Actually, I have two things. First of all, Mike, now that we are about halfway through the year and we can kind of project what it looks like total shipments will be throughout this whole year, if you take your product numbers -- and you have to make some assumptions with flat-panel and service and such -- but if you look at your shipments and you compare it to others in the industry and try to project what this year is going to look like, it looks like shipments are going to be up somewhere in the range of 50% to 60% year-over-year. That is a lot more CapEx than I think people are thinking. I'm just wondering for your perspectives, because when you divide that by chip revenues, it looks like there's a big jump this year in capital intensity. I'm wondering if those numbers aren't the numbers you get when you do that analysis, or if you think that that is not a valid analysis?
Mike Splinter: We get quite a different number. I think you have heard us say we think WFE is in the 20% to 25% range. We do agree that capital intensity is going up. And I think it is just a slight disagreement on the magnitude.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: So you'd say right now your projection for WFE this year is up more like 20% or 25% and not more like 50% or 60%?
Mike Splinter: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Suresh Balaraman, ThinkEquity Partners.
Suresh Balaraman - ThinkEquity Partners : You guys mentioned that North America would be down. Is that normal lumpiness? Also, have you guys seen any pushouts related to delays in Vista or other product delays?
Mike Splinter: North America is just the normal cycle of who orders and we certainly haven't seen any pushouts in the memory area at this point. I don't think Vista would drive more memory. We haven't seen any pushout due to Vista or in the memory area.
Operator: Our next question comes from Timm Schulze-Melander, Morgan Stanley.
Timm Schulze-Melander - Morgan Stanley : Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong numbers. A two-part question, if I may. The first, on the reclassification of your cash, that $2.5 billion that has been parked into long-term assets. Is the correct way to think about that that you view that $2.5 billion as really a sort of core strategic buffer and the other $3.5 billion, you're viewing really more tactically? Secondly, Mike, you made a comment about how Applied is getting better and better in M&A in the valuation and execution of M&A. Is it reasonable just thinking about how you calculate hurdle rates of return, that you are benchmarking them against the return on cash?
Nancy Handel: Yes, I will take the question on the reclassification. I don't think you should read really anything into that activity and accounting change there. This policy really classifies these securities, which are also available for sale, as current or long term based on the maturities of the investment; while the prior classification, the way we had it before was based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations. So it really is based on the expectation about the timeframe under which the underlying securities would be utilized in the operations. But as we present our business going forward, we will be adding that in as we present our comments about our liquidity positions.
Mike Splinter: So Timm, on hurdle rates, of course that is one of the things we look at in deciding on an acquisition. But as you can imagine, we are really looking at these things to fit into the strategy of growth. I think these two that we talked about in the last few weeks are good examples of adding on markets to our core business that is already growing. These are new areas that we feel by applying our nanomanufacturing technology, we will be able to accelerate the growth.  So it is a complex equation on how we look at these. But in the end, we want them to help the Company grow and outperform in the long run.
Operator: Our next question comes from Edward White - Lehman Brothers.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: In the quarter, you had a big jump in the number of large orders, the number of orders over $100 million. It is the highest it's been in some time; and the number in the range of $50 million to $100 million, the highest in some time. Can you talk qualitatively about what is accounting for that, if there is anything to read into that?
Nancy Handel: I don't think there is anything to read into that. It really demonstrates the way the business is coming together and the customers' expectation about what they need to bring in their factory in a reasonable period of time.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Secondly, qualitatively, were there any areas where products which were particularly stronger than others, or was it fairly uniform product strength across the board for the quarter?
Mike Splinter: Well, I would say that CVD outgrew all our other product areas. We had strong growth in many areas, but CVD was particularly strong in the quarter, leading all other product groups.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stuart Muter, RBC Capital Markets.
Stuart Muter - RBC Capital Markets: Following up on your comments about CVD and memory, in terms of the flash opportunity now that some processes are going to, SA-CVD, could you help us understand your potential to gain a bigger piece of the flash equipment market with a shift away from high-density plasma CVD?
Mike Splinter: Well, I am not sure I'm going to help you with a lot of numbers here. But yes, the shallow trench isolation is a significant application for us. Customers are moving in our direction to satisfy that need. Also, that is a big step; as big a step in growth in this market with flash is advanced patterning films. Really, the leaders in lithography have now moved from logic to flash memory. They are really working hard every angle to improve the ability to print spaces.  Between those two applications, it is showing significant growth and share gain in the memory area, particularly in flash.
Stuart Muter - RBC Capital Markets: If I could sneak a quick follow-up, just on the foundries, you've mentioned you expect the foundries to be stronger in the second half of your fiscal year. Is that really based upon your belief that they have to spend because their utilization rates are higher, or is that based upon what they are telling you and talking about in terms of the order book that is coming through?
Mike Splinter: Some of both. It depends on the specific customer. Some are already moving their orders up and we're seeing it in the beginning of this quarter. Others we can see the need and activity is starting to increase.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shekhar Pramanick - Moors & Cabot.
Shekhar Pramanick - Moors & Cabot : A two-part question. In your prepared commentary, you talked about increasing the opportunity on the flat-panel side. Should we be reading this more than AFCO, more than CVD, more opportunity in array, where there are a bunch of layers or removal of the layers you could do? Second, if you could give us a little more update how you are making progress in the UVision or even in the defect sensitive, particularly by memory foundry logic. That would be helpful.
Mike Splinter: On the flat-panel, AFCO obviously allows us to get into the color filter area. As you know, we are also in the e-beam tester area now and growing our share there. But we think we ought to be the Applied Materials of the flat-panel world, over a period time, as we introduce more new products. On the progress with UVision, we are on track with what we said. This is a great product for memory area where there are really defect sensitive, very small defect sensitivities. So we have been concentrating on the memory manufacturers first, actually. I think as you know, we have more than 13 machines at 13 customers. And that is all progressing on track right now. On darkfield, I don't think there's any real movement in the market in darkfield at this point. Our ComPlus 3 is doing pretty well. There's been a back and forth, but I don't think there's much movement in the market at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Hsueh, CIBC World Markets.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: One question, Mike, is on rotation from NAND flash to DRAM orders in the July quarter. You guys have pretty strong exposure to DRAM, as you said, and growing exposure to DRAM. Why is it that we are only seeing plus 5% to 10% order growth if the market is rotating in your favor in July?
Mike Splinter: Well, I am not so sure that the market is rotating in our favor. We think that our numbers are reasonably good with what is going to happen in the next three months, as far as overall orders in the industry.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Well, let me ask a totally separate question to Nancy. Nancy, it looks like you guys have done a real good job here in controlling OpEx in April. But when I plug in my numbers for July, should I be factoring a more meaningful step-up in OpEx, just due to SEMICON West? If I do that, that seems to imply a pretty good drop-through on 5% to 10% revenue growth to the gross margin line. I'm just wondering if there's any kind of mix shift or anything else on the gross margin line that would drive that?
Nancy Handel: I think that when you are looking ahead at our operating expenses, there might be some modest increase. We have a fair number of initiatives underway inside the Company. We've got work going on in our ERP area with our business transformation, as we call it.  We have had initiatives where we have discussed our investments in China. We've obviously got some new product areas. We have done a good job of being more efficient with our operating expense spend. So some modest increase might be anticipated, but not a whole lot more than that. If you look at the margin, our gross margin has continued to improve. We've been pretty vocal about the kind of programs we have had with global sourcing, with a lot of effort going into operating efficiency in our factory and trying to move down the investment of time and resources and our integrate to order on the manufacturing cycle, our modular final paths, bringing the product back out of the factory. So we are beginning to see some of the benefit from this. We would expect to continue to see that as the factory builds the current outlook.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Pelayo, Soleil Securities.
Steven Pelayo - Soleil Securities: Mike, I'm curious if you could just compare your comments today versus 90 days ago. If anything, you guys sound even more optimistic; despite the fact that we've heard some pretty incrementally negative headwinds over the last few weeks. I'm speaking of rising inventories and some pricing pressures and some major product cycle pushouts. Heck, even [Diamento] had some cautionary comments. So I agree that 2007 is a year of CapEx growth, but I'm quite surprised that you didn't at least acknowledge some of these headwinds in your prepared remarks. Has any of this been incorporated into your outlook or in your guidance? Or do you think this is just normal seasonal softness and all of it's really much ado about nothing?
Mike Splinter: Well, I think you have to look at the breadth of the market. DCs are still growing; the only place where you see inventory that I know clearly is in the PC market. When you look at the entirety of electronics and you look at Dataquest's number for the electronics market, it is growing extremely fast. Cell phones continue to up their number. I'm not sure where exactly what pricing pressure you're talking about, but flash prices dropped 40% in the first part of the year, have stabilized. There is no inventory of memory that I can recognize. So overall, I think with that kind of demand, it is pretty healthy. We're talking about these things in the first part of year where, at least in electronics, demand is still seasonal to the second half. So most of the consumption will be in the second half of the year. So as you think about the next four or five months, six months, factories are going to be fuller than they are today. There's going to be a demand for quite a bit more capacity. If we have a positive economic environment heading into '07, it should continue to be good. Like I said, in our business, there's always ups and downs because of capacity, lumpiness. When you take the longer-term view, you look at where our product line is, how it is making progress in the core business, how the industry is trending, our new opportunities, I think it makes us pretty optimistic about where we are.
Steven Pelayo - Soleil Securities: So if I can just summarize that in a follow-up, you are confident for the October quarter, let's just say orders for Applied Materials 90 days ago versus today -- if anything, you sound more confident that those are going to increase?
Mike Splinter: Yes, I'm more confident today than I was 90 days ago. I have more visibility. But I am certainly not ready to say anything at this point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Fitzgerald, Banc of America.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Mike, do you have any sense of how big third-party services at this point for Applied Materials equipment, and specifically for your own services or intellectual property that differentiates you from third party? Therefore, can you grow your business organically, or do you just go out and buy companies like the Singapore operation to grow the service business?
Mike Splinter: The third-party services are actually quite big around the world. So that's one of the reasons why we think that we will be able to gain share. Let me just comment a little bit, Mark, about what we're doing. One of the places where we are really concentrating our efforts is in what we call chamber performance systems or service. This is an area where we are using the technology we have. There are certain kind of coatings that go in that are very hard to repeat. We have patents and IP on many of these different areas. And we think that by doing that R&D centrally, largely here in Santa Clara, and then expanding globally, it is a great play for us. What we purchased a week or two ago is more capacity in Singapore so that we could implement some of those capabilities in Singapore. We didn't have a location where we could put our chamber performance systems or services in Singapore. So we bought some capacity to be able to proliferate that capability there.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: So bottom line, there is IP in the service side of the business and organic growth is more the strategy than ever?
Mike Splinter: Absolutely. That is how we are going to win. We can't win with just whether a customer hires a service technician or we hire a service technician. We win by bringing technical capability that nobody else can provide that ends up with productivity for the customers' factories.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gavin Duffy - A.G. Edwards.
Gavin Duffy - A.G. Edwards: Mike, I was just wondering, could you give us a sense of breakout where your customers are going to be as a percentage for next quarter, like DRAM versus foundry, logic?
Mike Splinter: What Nancy said earlier was that foundry was going to be up a bit as a percentage. Everything else was going to be roughly the same, I think. There will be a few points that have to come out of the other areas to feed the percentage growth in foundry. But other than that, we are not seeing any major shift here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Pang - Prudential Financial.
Ben Pang - Prudential Financial: In your comments, you mentioned some of the difficulties you've had in market share in 2005. The reversal that you see in 2006 due to the memory market; is that specifically on flash? Or is it also in DRAM? The second part of that question is, what is your view right now on how much higher capital spending is for combined memory in 2006 versus 2005?
Mike Splinter: As far as our share, we are working to gain in both flash and DRAM. We are gaining more in flash today than in DRAM. So that is about all I will say on that. As far as the mix of memory spending, your question was on memory versus logic spending?
Ben Pang - Prudential Financial: Right. What I'm trying to get at is '06 is going to obviously be a year for capital spending growth, and right now you are forecasting that you're going to outgrow the market because of market share reversal in memory. I want to get a handle, at least on the memory side, for CapEx; not your market share, but could you just try to put in perspective how high you see memory CapEx in 2006 versus 2005?
Mike Splinter: I don't know if I have the number right off the top of my head. How about if I get the number here, I will answer the question a little bit later.
Operator: Our final question comes from Mike O'Brien - Bear Stearns.
Mike O'Brien - Bear Stearns: If you could just maybe go through a little more detail on just some of the product wins in both etch and in plants? Are these wins that are going to materialize progressively this year, or is it really next generation?
Mike Splinter: Well, there is some of both. But in etch in particular, we have a strong ongoing business, particularly in the memory area. That has been gaining and growing. We are working very hard with customers on next generation with our new conductor etcher and increasing applications on dielectric.
Mike O'Brien - Bear Stearns: Just one final question on the July guidance -- whether it is conservative are not -- but do you expect each segment, semi systems, flat-panel and services, to all grow? Were all three within that guidance, or could one or more of them be down in July?
Nancy Handel: No, the outlook for each of our business areas is for a growth in that third quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for question-and-answer. I will now turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.
Randy Bane : Thank you, and I appreciate everyone being able to join us for the call this afternoon. If there are any follow-up questions, please call us. The number is posted on the Applied Materials website. I appreciate your time. Thank you very much.

Nancy Handel, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Paul, good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, I will cover the results of the first fiscal quarter of 2006. As we ended 2006, business conditions strengthened and drove improved performance for our side, demand coupled with customer's need for our most advance solution resulted in higher orders and strong profitability. Our continued focus on improving overall efficiency is yielding financial success. Our employee's commitment to delivering technological innovations and value added services that enhance customer’s productivity is what makes us a leader in our industry. Highlights for the first quarter were strong order performance and an increase, an 8% increase in revenue, going through to gross margin at 56%. In addition, we continue to deliver leading, industry leading cash flow and returned value to our stockholders to increased efficiency. For the first fiscal quarter, orders of $2.04 billion surpassed our target and we’re 21% higher than the fourth quarter of 2005. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.86 billion, 8% higher than the last quarter and exceeded our targets. Operating income was $144 million or 8% of revenue compared to 21% for the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income was $143 million or $0.09 per share compared to $247 million or $0.16 per share for the fourth quarter. Results for the first fiscal quarter included asset impairment and restructuring charges of approximately $215 million or $0.08 per share and equity-based compensation expenses of $52 million or $0.02 per share. Of this $52 million, $9 million was reflected in gross margin and $43 million in operating expense. Excluding these charges, the Company wouldn't have reported net income of $312 million or $0.19 per share. Reported gross margin for the first quarter was 45.1% compared to 44.2% for the fourth quarter of 2005. Equity based compensation programs decreased this quarter gross margin by 1.5%. Increased customer demand grew higher than expected order growth. In the quarter, DRAM orders represented 28% of silicon systems orders. Flash memory orders were 18% and foundry orders were 19%. Logic and other orders comprised the remaining 35%, 300 millimeter orders represented approximately 84% of total systems orders and 89% of the systems orders were of 100 nanometer and below processor technology. Three orders were in excess of $100 million, four orders were between $50 and $100 million and 14 orders were between $10 million and $50 million. Historically, many service and parts contracts have been renewed during the first fiscal quarter. This quarter was no exception and we had very strong service and part orders. Flat panel demand for generations 5 through 7.5 was also strong. During the first quarter orders increased from customers in Korea, Europe, North America and South East Asia and China. Orders by major geographic areas were Taiwan 24%, North America 22%, Korea 18%, Europe 15%, Japan 13% and South East Asia and China 8%. Backlog for the quarter increased to $2.73 billion compared to $2.57 billion for the fourth quarter of 2005, backlog adjustments totaled $30 million consisting primarily of currency adjustments and a few cancellations. During the first quarter broad based customer demand, rising fab utilization and investments in advanced technology drove the revenue increase. Our continued focus on improving operating efficiency is paying off in the form of increased gross margin. During the first quarter, we saw a 20% reduction in cycle times on 300 millimeter products that were delivered utilizing and integrate to order manufacturing process. Excluding asset impairment, restructuring charges and equity-based compensation expenses, Applied financial performance exceeded our targets and net ph 0815 our Company model. Operating expenses of $694 million included asset impairment, restructuring charges and equity-based compensation expenses totaling $258 million, excluding the guidance operating expenses increased approximately $27 million primarily as a result of increases in variable compensation. The effective tax rate for the first quarter up 22.4%, was lower than forecast primarily as a result of the benefit from the asset impairment and restructuring charges. We anticipate the effective tax rate for the second quarter will be approximately 31.5%. Excluding asset impairment, restructuring charges and equity-based compensation expenses Applied’s return on invested capital would have been 34%. We define return on invested capital as operating profit after tax excluding one time tax benefits calculated on an annualized basis, provided by the average invested capital less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our free cash flow generation for the quarter was $372 million. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activity less capital expenditure. During the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $127 million to $5.8 billion and included the repurchase at $27 million shares of our common stock for $500 million. Since the beginning of fiscal 2005, the company has repurchased approximately $128 million shares for a cash outlay of $2.2 billion. During the second fiscal quarter of 2006, we planned to repurchase shares in the range of $400 to $600 million. In December 2005, the company declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.03 per share payable on March 9th to stockholders of record as of February 16th. Accounts receivable increased by a $139 million, an inventory decrease by $11 million during the quarter. Capital spending for the quarter was $49 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $70 million. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 12,584 regular employees. As we enter our second fiscal quarter of 2006 we remain focused on driving gross margin improvement to company wide material cost reduction initiative such as common platform architecture impart, lower cost sourcing, integrate to order initiative and continued cycle time reduction. Our continued focus on improving operating efficiency is driving increased profitability and strong free cash flow. Mike will now provide his perspective on the market environment and the Company’s strong strategic position. Mike
Michael Splinter, Chief Executive Officer and President: Thanks Nancy, good afternoon and I would like to add my welcome to all of you joining the call today. As you can see from our press release, we have an exciting start to 2006. We experience the significant increase in customer demand at year-end which is extended through the quarter and translated in the higher than expected order growth and strong financial performance for Applied Materials. This was the second quarter in a row of increasing revenue and bookings. As we predicted last quarter, Q1 service orders were up primarily due to annual renewals of service and parts contracts. However the upside to our revenue and order projections came from semiconductor systems, which will significantly during the quarter. We are seeing the momentum across our system product portfolio for both high volume production as well as leading-edge 65 and 45 nanometer chip development applications. We are gaining market share and are in good position to continue these gains. I am confident that our innovative technology solutions are driving Applied to outgrow and outperform the industry, with the opportunity to deliver strong financial results throughout 2006. Discussions with customers about the prospects for 2006 leave me feeling really quite optimistic. The basic building blocks for demand in our end market are in place. Global macro-economics are stable with a major role, the economy is growing at respectable rate while emerging markets like China and India continue to boom. Demand for semiconductors and semiconductor related technology continues to increase. Fueled by the continued ramp of broadband around the world, the pervasiveness of PCs and cell phones, with complex chip and display applications and new must have consumer products with increasing amounts of digital content. The worldwide popularity of consumer applications translates directly in the strong chip demand and the need for new fabs to feed those markets. The Olympics and adoption of high definition TV are driving a surge in new generations of flat panel TVs which are extremely attractive in terms of picture quality and price. Our technology is directly linked to making those TVs possible and more affordable. We ship the world’s first Gen-8 PECVD system in January. The glass substrates size is over 5 square meters and capable of producing six 52-inch LCD TV’s. Well we expect flat panel orders to be lower for the next two quarters; manufactures are set to start the next phase of capacity expansion in the second half of the calendar year. In addition to expanding consumer electronics, corporate investment in IP is strengthening. The emphasis on security, server consolidations and the transition to more robust IP infrastructures is expected to bolster the spending for products with increased silicon content. Together these drivers result in a strong demand for memory and our customers are investing to produce increasing qualities of NAND, BIOS and DRAM. Continued double-digit growth in PC’s, strength in cell phones, the shift of game consoles to the cell architecture and increasing die sizes around the industry are expected to have a positive impact in our market in ‘06. These industry factors coupled with low inventories, high fab utilization rates add up to a very positive environment for wafer fabrication equipment spending. High fab utilization also translates into demand and opportunity for growth in the service products that we offer through Applied Global Services and Metron Technology. When we look across the landscape, we believe the potential exist for an extended upturn. Of course this view depends on continued U.S. consumer spending on high-tech devices as well as rapid expansion of consumer electronics spending in both China and India. Demand for broadening technology applications is producing opportunities that market share gains were applied in memory, logic, flat panel and service solutions. Third party forecast for semiconductor industry revenue have an upward bios in our view the outlook is currently 7% to 10% year-over-year. We are revising the view we discussed in November, in our November call for CapEx to be up, now between 10% and 15%. And we see WFE spending rising some 15% or 20% in 2006. This demonstrates that there is increasing equipment intensity in our industry. This year we are focusing on several key areas, first we hope our customers continue to drive more as law by offering them solutions and enable them to shrink from technology node to technology node. Our CVD business has been expanding applications significantly over the last year which is shown up in the near doubling of orders over the last two quarters. We have made significant gains in low-k dielectrics; this is where our Black Diamond I and II products reside. We have strong leadership in Advanced Patterning Films, strain engineering and the need for harp and other CVD films and flash memory is increasing. Basically we are winning all the new applications for our CVD product line. We have won every major PVD runoff since last August in both Memory and Logic. Our thin-film technology development and capability to do differentiated contact and via cleaning optimizes the contact resistance, the reliability and the yield giving us a growing technology in market lead. Our CMP system set the standard in the marketplace and our Ecmp system is leading the way for 45-nanometer where the combination of low-k dielectrics and small metal features requires new technology to reach our customers yield and the effect goals. At Applied, we have a new attitude about etch, with new leadership in place we are putting renewed focus and resources towards winning in the etch market. Our etch business order growth this year as expected to be significant, and is on track to achieve levels not seen since 2000. This is particularly driven by the growth of our conductor etch and the increasing acceptance of our dielectric etch processes and systems. It’s one way to mention discovering defect becomes more important, the new ComPlus 3 darkfield inspection system is targeted at 65-nanometers. Our UVision system provides the resolution required to detect 30-nanometer resist defects, and is shipped to a dozen top chip companies. We are seeing momentum for both our UVision and ComPlus products and we are winning a repeat business at advance nodes. To meet the accelerating demand for flash memory, we are gaining share with new applications that increase density and drive cost effectiveness. Flash is a huge opportunity for us. Our flash served available market is the fastest growing end-market segment we have, and there are a lot of emerging technical requirements as it designs migrate to these advance nodes. And transitioning from 90 to 70-nanometers, when you look at the number of wafer passes and corresponding number of tools required our opportunity increases by about 20% to 30%. Our Quantum X single wafer implant has increased its share in flash and DRAM with multiple orders for our several key customers. Significant improvements in defect performance of our systems should enable us to improve our market share during 2006. We haven’t been investing heavily in transistor performance over the last few years. Our products in and around the transistor have been growing rapidly. We expect SCSI is going into production, the industry has moved to our DPN technology for gate oxides and the flash memory world is quickly moving to our RadOx solution. Part of our – this part of our family of RTP system that continues to lead the industry. In service, our recent acquisition of ChemTrace and its integration in the Metron has created what we call our chamber performance services line that includes cleaning, giving coding and analysis. These services rely on fundamental technology and IP developed in our product groups that can translate into greater tool productivity for our customers that these capabilities are proliferated worldwide. Metron’s EcoSys division is also building an on surpass portfolio of gas and PFC abatement technologies to help customers meet their challenging environmental emissions requirements. Our successive link to our ability to develop future technology, we recently announced a joined effort with IMEC the industry leading nanoelectronic research center to develop 32-nanometer and 22-nanometer interconnects. IMEC has purchased a comprehensive suite of our leading-edge interconnect systems. We launched deployed – we also launched deployed ventures our in-house EC program to support breakthrough technology that can potentially be developed for future products. And we’ve already made an investment in a fewer solicitive company. We are seeing significant growth in bookings and revenue and we have renewed confidence about the strength of the year as end-market demand is strong. Inventories continue to be low, fab utilization is high and customers have recently announced increases in their CapEx plans for the year. Flash and DRAM continue to be constrained and we expect foundries to increase their investments in the second half of the year. In addition our service in flat panel orders and revenues should grow in the second half as well. In service we are offering new products virtually every month and have and as more our 300 millimeter products come offline to you, our service business should strengthen. In flat panels orders for the next phase of capacity will come in during the second half of the calendar year and we should once again reach a new high water mark as the industry grows and our footprint expands. With the continued commitments of our employees and confident that this should be an outgrow and outperformed year for Applied Materials. Thank you very much, now I will turn the call back over to Nancy to provide our second quarter targets. Nancy?
Nancy Handel, Chief Financial Officer and Senior VP: Thank you Mike. Our fiscal second quarter targets are as follows. Orders should be up approximately 15% to 20% from Q1 levels, revenues should be up 13% to 16% from Q1 levels. Earnings per share at $0.22 to $0.23 includes an estimated $0.02 per share for equity-based compensation. We expect strong customer demand for Flash, DRAM and Logic orders this quarter with service and parts below last quarter seasonally high contract renewals. And we expect flat panels to be at a lower level as customers absorb equipment delivery. With that I will turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Bowman, Managing Director of Investor Relation: Thank you Nancy. We will now begin our question and answer session. We would like to entertain questions from as many callers as possible as such please limit your questions to one per firm. Katrina, please begin with the first question.
Operator:
Operator Instruction:
Q - Jay Deahna: Thank you good afternoon, Mike two questions, if you look at your systems orders in the April quarter excluding flat panel and service, what’s kind of the apples-to-apples comparison on the order growth there, and do you expect something similar in the July quarter? That’s first question. And then second part is when your competitors seems to saying that there is an abnormal pricing environment in the industry but it looks like your margins are pretty normal compared to previous levels, also wondering if you could kind of expand on that a little bit? Thank you.
A - Michael Splinter: Sure, thanks Jay. First of all I think as we said during the call, flat panel orders will be down in Q2 you know kind of our historic pattern on service orders with Q4 being by far the largest, and so the strength is really in the systems, in semiconductor systems here, and that is – that’s what is driving the more than the entire growth of 15% to 20%. We’re really seeing the strength in many areas but if we look back to 2005, there was strong memory investment but our share there was low, we really worked hard to improve our share in memory area and we are starting to see some of our early results from that work, particularly in the CVD area with our APF films, or our HARP films as solid translation with isolation comes into flash memory. So we were really seeing strong, strong orders in semiconductor systems. As far as abnormal pricing if you look at our margin at similar revenue levels it’s between one and two points better than it had been in previous time. So, I don’t think there’s really any abnormal pricing situation here, our ASP are solid and it really technology drives, technology differentiation drives pricing.
Q - Jay Deahna: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
Q - Satya Kumar: Satya Kumar for John Pitzer. When I look at your orders by geography, in January orders from Korea have increased substantially and just recently there is been some concern that flash memory tends to be highly seasonal and some chip companies are looking for front half load their CapEx, what kind of linearity are you seeing for the second half in terms of orders given the service seasonality and are you seeing that impact your business in terms of orders at this time?
A - Michael Splinter: Well, Kumar as you know we’re not really projecting the second half but my scenario for the second half kind of goes like this. I think that there is going to be continued investments in flash and DRAM in the second half but actually DRAM generally a stronger in the second half to catch up we see this becoming on hopefully before at the end of the year having an impact on DRAM. We see that there is going to be continued more and more products with increased density in flash. So, I don’t see this, the flash memory things going down. But, for us going into the second half we are quite hopeful that boundaries where we have very strong share are going to come back and invest at a higher levels than they are today and then of course our traditional service business and flat panel business were also be stronger in the second half.
Q - Satya Kumar: Thanks, can you pick it off a real quick follow-up there. It looks like your margin scheme in better than expected and that’s been sort of trend that you guys are having, even all the efforts which you were doing for cycle down improvement and operational executions and the consolidation. Do you feel a potential that you could perhaps to address your target models in the near future, thanks.
A – Nancy Handel: We are actually quite pleased with the margin improvement that we’ve seen in this quarter and this is a result of a continued assessment we have across many disciplines that we’ve discussed before with our cycle time reductions and our focus on material cost sourcing from lower cost regions and a lot of work in common platforms and part, so we got good initiatives underway that we expect to continue to deliver benefits to the company, and so as revenue levels increase we would expect our margins to increase as the gross margin level and we’ve reflected that in the model though as to buy and to increase.
Q - Satya Kumar: Okay, thanks.
A - Michael Splinter: You know one thing I might add about the gross margins, in previous revenue, when we previous similar revenue levels our service percentage was much smaller than it is today in the mid 20s.
A - Paul Bowman: Next question Katrina.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edward White with Lehman Brothers.
Q – Edward White: Hi, I was wondering, when you look at the foundries do you have any senses to, what’s driving and what sort of kept them, from investing more now and what the key factors are would be for them to invest in the second half of the year sort of, what they seem to be current year and what about the situation in China, how do you see the foundries there trending as we go through the year?
A - Michael Splinter: You know Ed, I think it’s difficult to make a general statement here because it’s almost different by everyone of the major foundry. So, I would encourage you to go ask, my compatriot CEOs in those companies. But when you look around from area-to-area part of it is just ramp on 90-nanometers and how high the utilization is there how fast they can move products off 130 down to 90 and to the advance nodes, I think that’s the biggest part of it. And, then to your question about China which is also largely a foundry question, we think that there will be, we’ll see some increase in China investment in Q2, we’ll see that growth continue in Q3 and Q4. We don’t expect it to be back to 2004 levels yet but it will be pretty good.
Q – Edward White: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Hi, actually I had two things. Number one, Mike can you give us some idea in the guidance about 15% to 20% sequentially, what you think the customer bucket breakdown might look like? So, memory logic foundry, thanks and then I have a follow-up, thanks.
A - Michael Splinter: We think that memory that’s flash and DRAM together will be about half the orders and then logic will be around 30 and then the remainder will be, foundries will be just slightly under 20.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Okay, great, and then I guess………
A - Michael Splinter: Hey, Tim, you know typically in the past foundries have been above, on average when you look at your historic above 30.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Right, of course, of course, thanks. Nancy, then can you actually breakout if you, it seem to me that if I go back it would seem that service towards flat panel; if you kind of add up both of those as a group that they are roughly 35% to 40% of the total orders. So, if you take those down pretty significantly in the April quarter, it would seem that if you isolate the semiconductor product orders that they are up something in excess of 30% sequentially as per the guidance, is that the right way to think about it?
A - Nancy Handel: It’s the right way to think about it we’ve – as we’ve talked before, I mean we don’t provide that product kind of level of detail but the business in the second quarter is going to be driven strongly by the systems area of investment. So your conclusions were headed the right direction.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Q – James Covello: Good evening, thanks so much. Basically one quick question, two parts; on the for the – both the NAND flash and then for the foundries, is there a pricing expectation or bit growth expectation for NAND flash that you are using to base your CapEx estimate on. And then for the foundries, when you talk about improving foundry CapEx in the second half, is there a foundry utilization rate assumption that you are making to drive that CapEx expectation? Thank you.
A - Michael Splinter: We’re thinking that bit growth and flash is going to be in the 150% range. And for the foundry utilization, something approaching 90%.
Q – James Covello: Okay so first on the NAND flash, is there a pricing assumption that you have along with the bit growth?
A - Michael Splinter: You mean a bit, price for bit?
Q – James Covello: Well, I mean – the price decline here, there is a normal price decline per year that always happens in memory, is there an assumption you’re making there. No, what I’m trying to say is – is there an expectation on pricing that you think these guys give that and rise their CapEx or is there a price level of which you think some of the CapEx numbers would be at risk if the pricing falls off a little more than we expect. Then on the foundries, yeah, you answered the question on the utilization…
A - Michael Splinter: I got, the volume right now, I think is more key in the popularity of the end products. Certainly right now as long as they get more density for a stable price, I think that for the various consumer products we’ll absorb all the flash that’s available. So, in total volume you will be, in total with total volume and memory catches up with the demand. I think we’re going to see a fairly stable pricing environment, unlike last year where, pricing in DRAMs dropped in the half in the first six months of the year. We still saw good trend on investment, I think we are going to be in a fairly stable pricing environment which creates a very positive investment in our landscape.
Q – James Covello: Terrific, thanks so much.
A - Michael Splinter: Thanks Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.
Q - Patrick Ho: First a housekeeping question, can you give a breakdown of the stock options in the OpEx line what was it between like G&A and R&D?
A - Nancy Handel: No, we’re going to, we’re providing that at sort of an aggregate level in the OpEx line. It was about 83% of the charge went to the OpEx line and about 17% of the charge went to the margin.
Q - Patrick Ho: And that – is that something that can be relatively consistent going forward?
A - Nancy Handel: I think you can for example, that’s pretty consistent, we would expect it to stay in that range.
Q - Patrick Ho: Okay great. And then just my one question, in terms of lead times have you noticed any considerable changes in lead times over the past few months and looking ahead over the next few quarters?
A - Michael Splinter: No, I mean Nancy talked earlier about our integration of order program and a strong work from our operations team to reduce cycle time. So we’re pretty much right on where we expect to be it, varies little bit by machine type but lead times are holding.
Q - Patrick Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike O'Brien with Bear Stearns.
Q - Michael O'Brien: Yeah I just wanted to go over little bit into the etch – etch side of the equation. You are pretty low – well I think you are pretty low levels now, so it’s just conductor aspect you’re expecting to see is, surge in order through this very strong growth in orders of net, that really from a low base. And what’s going to be the differentiation to be able to get that business back and when do you think you can get back some dielectric business? Thanks.
A - Michael Splinter: Actually its both conductor and dielectric etch. And, we said that orders and of course we expect revenue to follow to be the highest as been since 2000. The market has grown certainly since 2000 so in those areas, so we’re novel, we want to be. But we think that in both of those areas we have differentiation, we think that our enabler has really excellent dielectric etch characteristics for etching not only the difficult films like the hard mask films. But for etching, our Black Diamond II films and block we are optimizing that between our product groups it in fact can give us significant differentiation there. And then in our conductor and metal etch area, we believe that our match up of our stripping and etching technology provide the best productivity in yielding the industry.
Q - Michael O'Brien: These – the orders increases in business last year that you are gaining back or these already customs or you’re – is going to just ordering again?
A - Michael Splinter: Some of those.
Q - Michael O'Brien: Did you buy asset one way or the other?
A - Michael Splinter: Pardon me.
Q - Michael O'Brien: Did you buy asset one way or the other? I am just trying to understand if you are…
A - Michael Splinter: Mostly customers have reorders; certainly that’s the largest percentage of it.
Q - Michael O'Brien: Okay, thank you.
A - Michael Splinter: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Maire with Needham.
Q - Robert Maire: Let me give numbers by the way, if I look at the memory market there is been some pressure taken off at DRAM market by migration of capacity over to flash and we heard one of your sub-suppliers talk about tracking five 300 millimeter projects out of Taiwan and such. Do you expect that to continue or would we expect going forward that rather than migrating DRAM facilities over to flash production that will just focus on building new NAND flash capacity or how do you see the, I guess the balance of power between, between those two shaping up?
A - Michael Splinter: The biggest supplier is going to have the most flexibility, I think is the first name of the game probably number, number two is more focused strictly on flash, number three is got flexibility. And number four will be focused strictly on flash, so it’s kind of, kind of different by companies. So I think that the DRAM guys will have big flash investments are going to keep their flexibility as high as they possibly can and move to where the market is, it only sense.
Q - Robert Maire: And are you tracking a similar number of fabs or how many fabs do you think, are there being dealt for flash and to a DRAM.
A - Michael Splinter: Is the question before the end of the year?
Q - Robert Maire: For which equipment is being ordered in 06.
A - Michael Splinter: I don’t have a number like that. All the projects totaled that we track are, we are tracking over 50 projects around the world but those are all DRAM, flash, that’s the total, total number. I don’t have a good number for you.
Q - Robert Maire: And those are primarily 300 millimeter?
A - Michael Splinter: Yeah, you know 85% of our business is 300 all those 53 are 300 millimeter.
Q - Robert Maire: It just one thing relating to that in terms of the follow-up of 200 it seems 8-inch is kind of filled in there do you expect that to fall off to a lower number by the end of the year or some of the older calendar is going to keep that number up?
A - Michael Splinter: You know, I don’t really know its kind of been in this 10% to 15% range for a while eventually its going to fall off, I don’t know where its going to be, by the end of the year or not. If there is strong capacity pull this year, I don’t think it’s going to fall off because there is still space and a number of that foundries particularly in China where they can fill up a little capacity and the second tier foundries are still at 200 millimeters. So they could they could easily be, 10% or 15% of the business.
Q - Robert Maire: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Garyshueh with CIBC World Market.
Q - Garyshueh: Hi guys, can you hear me?
A - Michael Splinter: Yeah go ahead Gary.
Q - Garyshueh: Okay just a couple of questions to you, can you actually kind of walk us through what integration of order means for you? Now let in terms of kind of reducing cycle times but is there any impacted gross margin?
A - Nancy Handel: No the integrate order process Gary, is one that allows us to basically divide our manufacturing process in to lower level of sub units and so our sub marginal that can be put together in a more what I call generic form and then integrated with product customizations coming in later in the manufacturing process, it allows us to do a better inventory management. It allows us to bring the movement of the product to the factory for in a more efficient manner and we believe that through the cycle time improvement it gives, that allows us to get some margin improvement. So it’s a comprehensive strategy for really improving the cycle on the manufacturing.
Q - Garyshueh: So Nancy, I think that’s middle kind of optimistic about gross margin then as far as that are made integration order?
A - Nancy Handel: We are seeing benefit in the manufacturing in the gross margin area currently and so we expect to continue to reach those benefits as we go forward and bring more products through that. But I would say that it’s reflected in the margin model that we’ve already put in place.
Q - Garyshueh: Okay, one last question kind of larger reaching question here Mike. Annex in Taiwan and things are straightening up pretty well for DRAM in 2007. I am just wondering specific with DRAM can you kind of walk us through some products that will be kind of gain or increase you already started exposure in DRAM even stronger in ’07.
A - Michael Splinter: Sure, you know what we are doing in DRAM is pretty a kind of what we’re doing in flash we think that all of our CVD products was – first of all for shallow trench isolation. And then we are seeing the DRAM guys starting to adopt strain films for DRAM as well evidently improves the performance of the sale and as they move to more advanced lithography CMP starts to come in both for oxide and for those that are moving those had moved to copper of course get a whole new array of our products from PVD ECP to CMP. So we are seeing that happening as well and few of the DRAM manufactures.
Q - Garyshueh: Great thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Schulze Melander with Morgan Stanley.
Q - Timothy N. Schulze Melander: Hi, congratulations on a very strong set of numbers back. Two quick things just may be some modeling first, is the first you will see, seeing very strong FPD orders, Nancy could you just present a stand when you expect these reflect in to revenue. And then secondly, just following on the question on the flash memory order strength, Mike as you look at those projects where you won those bookings, can you just share with us when you would expect are that equipment to ship and when you would expect it to actually become productive, is it still going to be in ’06 or is it really that going to be an output of flash memory in ’07? Thank you.
A - Nancy Handel: I’ll comment on that panel business that, cycles are longer in the panel business, they tends to run on maybe outwards of 9 months where the product. As we have so many new generations of technology in the field that, it runs a little bit longer in the cycle time. So, for the new products out there it takes about three quarters.
Q - Timothy N. Schulze Melander: Great. That would be the orders you just got in January would basically be sneaking in kind of the October-November timeframe?
A - Nancy Handel: Right, that’s the kind of timeframe associated with turning those into the revenues.
Q - Timothy N. Schulze Melander: Great, thanks.
A - Nancy Handel: Mike.
A - Michael Splinter: On the Flash memory point, we already see our revenue going up in Q2, primarily because – more than primarily because of semiconductor systems. So, we should see some capacity that come online in the second half of the year, but most of these orders and the orders that we're going to give in the next quarter will really end-up being capacity in 2007.
Q - Timothy N. Schulze Melander: Terrific, thanks very much.
A - Michael Splinter: Unit sales in 2007.
Operator: Your next question comes from Raj Seth with SG Cowen.
Q - Raj Seth: Hi thanks for taking the question. Mike, one of the features of this market over the last couple of years has been more incremental capacity additions. I am curious, if you think this is now a permanent feature of this market or do you think with more positive backdrop that you outlined that there is a willingness to make larger forward investment here.
A - Michael Splinter: Well, I think the foundation is incremental capacity investments. And we could see, if you look back 2005, the drop-off in 2005 ended up being at a higher level than back in 2003. So, that foundation is incremental capacity addition. I think, we are starting to see some companies really willing to make big investments, but it’s generally the big 5, the top 5 customers in the industry.
Q - Raj Seth: Yeah, are you seeing now as you – I think have in previous cycles, a real broadening of participation or is it so pretty much the usual suspects that are driving the business?
A - Michael Splinter: No, actually it’s getting quite broad, it really is. As, when you look up and down, the top 25 or 30 semiconductor companies are starting to see them, much more interested in investing at this point. And in part that’s why we think we are still in the early phases of the cycle, because people are just starting to think this through and getting and starting to make some investments, some of the big guys are making big investments, little guys are making little investments but in the end it gets down to products and technology that we are offering for all the semiconductor companies.
Q - Raj Seth: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Q - Stephen Chin: Great thank you, hi Mike. In terms of the orders by geography, I guess, I was little surprised to see that bookings from Japan were down sequentially. I guess, the question is, why we think that was and what was your expectation be in terms of the orders by geography next quarter?
A - Michael Splinter: Yeah, Japan is kind of been in the low over the last two quarters after having a very strong 2005. And we think in the next quarter, they are going to rebound substantially.
Q - Stephen Chin: Okay, and if I could sneak a second one in, it sounded like, Mike you are implying in one of your assets that some of the gross margin improvement was due to the services division. Can you give us an idea, how material of an impact that had this quarter and is this improvement sustainable?
A - Michael Splinter: No, that was not my point. My point was that we are showing higher gross margin with an increase – with the service being – service business being a larger portion of our overall business. As we’ve said in the past, our service gross margin is substantially lower than our equipment gross margin that’s why we’ve been trying to focus everybody on operating margin and result. But my point was that, we are showing gross margin improvement even though our low margin – lower margin service business is a bigger part of the overall business.
Q - Stephen Chin: Okay thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Q - Brett Hodess: Questions, first if the foundry business picks up given you historically high share there and what not, does that have a favorable impact relative to some of the other segments on margins or is it, there was really no difference in profitability as you see the dip at market?
A - Michael Splinter: I am not sure, I really understand your question, Brett.
Q - Brett Hodess: Are the foundry customers’ better margin customers since you typically had very high share there?
A – Nancy Handel: I think that, the gross margin that we get across all of our customers is in similar areas, its not –look at it as a customer specific kind of discussion.
Q - Brett Hodess: Okay, and then secondly on the operating expenses, it looks like about 2/3rds of the growth was, stock compensation sequentially sold it. The absolute level grew very little and the quarter level if you will grew very well, can we continue to see very slow growth in the core SG&A and R&D levels?
A – Nancy Handel: Well, I think, if you look at the aggregate what I said in my prepared remarks was that our operating expenses, if you look at, if you take out the stock-based compensation, we are now ,I think, it was $27 million.
Q - Brett Hodess: Right.
A - Nancy Handel: That was primarily in the area of variable comp. So, if you look at it associated with that level of expense, we’re going to work very diligently to hold expenses in that area. Now we have a few things coming in and out, we announced our real estate restructuring and we get some savings associated with our buildings and that we announced our building, restructuring we announced. We also have investment going on in our, as we’ve mentioned previously, our enterprise transition to MY SAP. So we’ve got some flows in and out in the OpEx line but it might go up slightly but we generally try to hold it in this range.
Q - Brett Hodess: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Pelayo with Soleil Securities.
Q - Steven Pelayo: Great, Nancy, when I turn to apples-to-apples in the fourth quarter ’05, fiscal 4Q, the October quarters you have options impact in there. And so when I have the 50 bits more to your gross margin line if you exclude the options in your January just reported quarter. What kind of incremental gross margins about 62% drop there? And so now, I am going to focus on GAAP going forward, apples-to-apples here. Do you think that kind of incremental drop though was still possible here especially the mix shift for the semi side on the gross margin line. If so that, as you approaching maybe 47% gross margins at the mid point of your revenue guidance next quarter?
A - Nancy Handel: I think your math is pretty good, I mean we certainly expect to be able to improve our gross margins as our revenue increases. And we’ve gotten some very good efficiencies here that were passing through in terms of drop through, go through from the incremental revenue. So, your math is pretty good.
Q - Steven Pelayo: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Q - Stephen O'Rourke: Thanks for taking my call. Two questions, if wafer fab equipment is up 15% to 20% in ’06, how much Applied revenue grow. And secondly can you give us an update on your ion implant business, particularly high current there is a fair amount of weather that is out there about market share shifts?
A - Michael Splinter: Sure, we think that we will grow substantially faster than the WFE market and we’ll grow faster than the WFE market because we are expanding our stand and expanding our share. I’m not going to give you a specific number there but I think you can figure it out from what we’ve already said but we think that projection will continue to grow throughout the year. Our ion implant business has been relatively flat and so that’s about as exciting as it is. And well this transition, we only have a high current business by, we are or we are not participating in any other segment of the implant business at the current time. That’s the transition from single wafer to or from patch to single wafer. We haven’t really gain share in this transition which is not exactly where we want to be.
A - Paul Bowman: Next question operator.
Operator: Your next question comes from William Lu with Piper Jaffray.
Q - William Lu: Yeah, hi thank you. I’ve got a clarification in the question. Early in the call, I think even Michael and Nancy said the flat panels reach a new water mark at later on this year. Is that a high water mark on a quarterly basis or is that high water mark in terms of 2006 or 2005?
A - Michael Splinter: Bill, that will be on a quarterly basis, what we are – what I said – what we said was orders will be down to for the next two quarters and then start to pick up in the second half of the year. I think that’s pretty consistent with overall industry and what the price surge is saying these days. And then by our fourth quarter, we should have a record quarter.
Q - William Lu: So, what’s the overall outlook in for flat panel type of spending year-over-year?
A - Michael Splinter: We are pretty much in line with display search and they are saying just kind of 0% to 10%.
Q - William Lu: Okay, great and then just a question, I seem to be hearing more and more stuff about how there is a need for better manufacturing in the silicon arena. Is that something you guys like you give into. Can you just talk about – more about that if you do, what are the concessions that you might receive?
A - Michael Splinter: We don’t have really anything to say about that at this time.
Q - William Lu: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shekhar Pramanick with Moors & Cabot.
Q - Shekhar Pramanick: Hi good afternoon, question for Mike. You kind of talked about etch management changes, is it a new higher. And the second, recently you had a pretty high profile wind say like processor guy, you were existing there, but you are doing non-critical etch now, suddenly you are doing all critical etches. And what’s really changed in the dielectric etch that precipitated that And then I have one more another question.
A - Michael Splinter: Well, Tom St. Dennis came in joined us a few months back, 4 or 5 months back now. He is a really been revamping the organization there and still in some new purpose to momentum. And the difference that the customer that you are talking about was ,we, our technical performance was outstanding and been able to perform the various critical etches, so that’s – it was just technical differentiation.
Q - Shekhar Pramanick: On to adding another key etch aggregative or how added in most recent times?
A - Michael Splinter: Yes, we’ve added several people, I am not discussing any other – any other people besides Tom.
Q - Shekhar Pramanick: All right, my other question was on flat panel, we have been waiting for some much bigger products such as DVD and etches for some time. But we haven’t heard it yet, is it still a kind of a developmental stage or should we be seeing it more in the near future?
A - Michael Splinter: When we are ready to announce a product it will be ready for high volume production. So, I think you should take that as my commitment both to the industry that when we are going to introduce the product, its really going to be ready to ramp and be ready to serve the needs of the customers to drive cost down and technology improvement.
A - Paul Bowman: Katrina, we’ve got time for one more question and then we’ll make our closing remarks. So, if you could take the last question please?
Operator: Your next question comes from Stuart Muter with RBC Capital Markets.
Q - Stuart Muter: Yeah thanks for taking my question. And question for Mike on the UVision product, earlier in your prepared remarks, you said that, you have shipped the parts for about a dozen or so customers, have you received multi-system orders from some of these customers?
A - Michael Splinter: Yes we have, I am sorry I didn’t mention that during my remarks, I must have forgot but yes we've received multiple orders and we were -- we’ve taken revenue from number of machines already and we are on target for our year-end goals. To give you an idea for our target for the year, we’ve surpassed 15% of our target for the year in the first quarter. So, with this machine ramping during the year, we are pretty confident we are going to get there.
Q - Stuart Muter: Thank you.
