===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the First Quarter 2025 AMETEK Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Kevin Coleman.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and welcome to AMETEK's first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dalip Puri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which represent the company's current expectations and are based on information currently available to the company. Various risk factors and uncertainties, including government trade policies and tariffs could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2024 or 2025 results or 2025 guidance will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization and excluding a pretax $29.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share charge in the first quarter of 2024 for integration costs related to the Paragon Medical acquisition. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a strong start to 2025 with excellent first quarter results. We delivered robust margin expansion, generated strong free cash flow and delivered earnings above our expectations. Additionally, orders were again strong in the quarter. Our results reflect the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our niche differentiated businesses and most importantly, the outstanding efforts from our colleagues. Now let me turn to our first quarter financial results. Sales were $1.73 billion, essentially in line with the first quarter of 2024. Organic sales were down 1%, acquisitions added 1 point and foreign currency was flat. Orders were strong in the quarter with overall orders up 8% and organic orders up 3% versus the prior year. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.04, and we ended the first quarter with a backlog of $3.47 billion, near record levels. AMETEK's operating performance to start the year was excellent. Operating income in the quarter was $455 million, a 2% increase over the first quarter of 2024. Operating margins were 26.3% in the quarter, up 60 basis points from the prior year. And excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, core margins were up 90 basis points in the quarter. EBITDA in the quarter was $559 million, up 3% versus the prior year, with EBITDA margins an impressive 32.2%. This operating performance led to strong cash generation with free cash flow of $394 million in the quarter and free cash flow to net income conversion of 112%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.75, up 7% versus the first quarter of 2024 and above our guidance range of $1.67 to $1.69 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Our Electronic Instruments Group continues to deliver excellent operating performance, resulting in robust operating margins. EIG sales were $1.14 billion, down 1% from the first quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 2%, acquisitions added 2 points and foreign currency was a 1-point headwind. EIG operating income was up slightly to $354.1 million, and operating margins were very strong at 31%, up 50 basis points from the prior year, while core margins were an impressive 110 basis points. EMG delivered strong growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's first quarter sales were a record $588.3 million, up 2% versus the prior year, with organic sales also up 2%. In the quarter, we experienced improving order patterns, especially within our Paragon Medical business. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $128.7 million, up 7% compared to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins were 21.9%, up a sizable 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2024. I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter with robust margin expansion, strong order growth, excellent cash flow generation and 7% earnings growth despite a continued uncertain economic environment. We remain committed to making strategic investments in our businesses to best position them for long-term growth. These investments are supporting our global and market expansion and technology innovation strategies. For all of 2025, we continue to expect to invest an incremental $85 million in support of these initiatives with key investments in research, development and engineering to help advance our product differentiation. Our Vitality Index, which measures the sales of new products introduced in the past 3 years was a strong 26% in the first quarter. We are confident that these investments will further solidify our competitive positions in our core markets and help broaden our exposure within new attractive growth markets. I want to take a moment to highlight just two of the many recent new product introductions across the company. First, from Gatan, a leader in electron microscope technology. They recently launched the EDAX Elite Ultra Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy system. The Elite Ultra solves a common challenge in advanced materials research by improving the ability to map and quantify elements in very thin samples. This system provides faster, more accurate results, allowing for deeper insights into material composition. One of the key features of the Elite Ultra is a larger sensor, which captures more x-rays and improves the system sensitivity to a wider range of elements, leading to better data and faster analysis. Gatan worked closely with another AMETEK business, AMETEK [ph] in the development of this advanced sensor technology. This is just one example of the ways our businesses partner together to help support and accelerate our technology innovation. With this new product introduction, Gatan continues to lead the way in developing advanced solutions that help scientists and engineers push the boundaries of their scientific research. Vision Research also launched a new line of small, powerful high-speed cameras, the Phantom KT-series. These cameras leverage a custom design high-speed sensor from Forza Silicon, another AMETEK business. These sensors provide superior image quality and performance, making them ideal for advanced applications. Their compact design makes them easy to use in a variety of settings, whether for industrial testing, motion analysis or medical research. Through this latest innovation, Vision Research continues to lead the market in high-speed imaging technology, offering researchers powerful tools to capture and analyze fast-moving phenomena. These advancements, along with many others introduced in the quarter, highlight our continued commitment to our customers and position us well to drive long-term success and meet evolving needs across emerging applications. Now switching to capital deployment. Strategic acquisitions remain our number one priority for capital deployment. We are managing a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. While our top priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions, we are also well positioned to deploy capital on share buybacks. We have a $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization. And as we have shown in prior periods of market dislocation, we are willing to opportunistically purchase shares. Given our robust free cash flow generation and strong flexible balance sheet, we are well positioned to deploy capital on both strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share purchases. Now let me share our views on the rapidly evolving trade conflict and how AMETEK is approaching this period of heightened uncertainty. Taking a step back, during the first quarter, we saw improving order patterns and generally solid conditions across most markets and geographies. While there was still some cautiousness from customers, conditions were improving uncertainty around trade policy and its implications have increased. Although it is impossible to know how these trade conflicts will evolve, we are confident in our ability to successfully navigate an uncertain and changing economic environment. Our distributed operating structure empowers local teams to respond quickly and appropriately to the unique dynamics of their businesses, markets, supply chains and customers. This level of flexibility is a meaningful advantage in a dynamic environment such as the current one. Our portfolio of highly differentiated products and mission-critical applications will allow us to effectively pass through higher input costs, including tariffs, while continuing to deliver strong margins and cash flows. Our broad exposure and diversification across end markets and geographies limit our dependence on any single customer, product, technology, supplier or region. This diversification is a strategic strength and helps shield the entire company from a concentrated risk. Our large global manufacturing footprint and supplier base, along with our asset-light business model will allow us to localize production and adjust supply chains. And lastly, our strong balance sheet and outstanding cash flow generation provides us with the ability to continue playing offense through acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases while also continuing to invest in our businesses. During the first wave of the China tariffs in 2018, during COVID and then again, during the resulting supply chain crisis, there were high levels of economic uncertainty. And each time, our businesses quickly reacted and strengthened their positions. Our business is robust by design and resilient by nature. We use periods of disruption to make our businesses stronger and more efficient. We use our strong cash flows and balance sheet to better position AMETEK for accelerated growth following the period of uncertainty. We are confident we can do the same in this environment. More specifically, our businesses have responded quickly and have developed tariff response plans, which include specific mitigation actions to offset the impact from tariffs. These mitigation actions include select pricing initiatives, localization of production operations, adjustments to our supply chain and targeted productivity actions. We are also finding opportunities created by the tariffs to take advantage of our substantial U.S. manufacturing footprint to broaden our customer base and support their growth in the U.S. While uncertainty has increased as a result of the global trade dynamics, we believe we can offset tariff headwinds through the implementation of these mitigation actions. As a result, we continue to expect full year sales to be up low single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2024. We also continue to expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.02 to $7.18, up 3% to 5% compared to last year's results. We expect the benefits from these various mitigating actions to build throughout the year. We remain confident in our full year outlook and our ability to deliver strong results in 2025. In summary, AMETEK delivered strong results to start the year. Our businesses executed exceptionally well, delivering strong margins, solid orders growth and earnings ahead of our expectations. The durability of the AMETEK growth model, combined with our diversified market exposures, outstanding cash flows and proven management capabilities position us well to navigate through these uncertain economic times. We remain focused on delivering long-term growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders. I will now turn it over to Dalip, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip?
Dalip Puri: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered a strong start to the year, highlighted by excellent operating performance, robust core margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversion. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the first quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $28 million, up $1.5 million from the prior year. For the full year, we continue to expect general and administrative expenses to be up modestly versus 2024 levels and to remain at approximately 1.5% of sales. First quarter other operating expenses were up $1 million compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to lower interest and investment income. First quarter interest expense was $19 million. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19%, in line with the first quarter of 2024. For 2025, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. As we have stated in the past, actual and quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $23 million. And for the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $155 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $106 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $410 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $203 million or $0.88 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the first quarter was 18.1% of sales. That compares to 18.7% in last year's first quarter. Operating cash flow was $418 million up 2% versus the first quarter of 2024, while free cash flow was $394 million, up 3% over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was strong at 112% in the quarter. For 2025, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 115% of net income. Total debt at March 31 was $1.9 billion, down from $2.1 billion at the end of 2024. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $399 million. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.7 times. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and our active acquisition pipeline. While acquisitions remain our number one capital allocation priority for use of our free cash flow, we also seek to provide value to our shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and a consistently increasing dividend. In February, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.31 per share, our sixth consecutive year of 10% plus annual increases in our dividend payout. Additionally, AMETEK's Board of Directors approved a $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization in February that provides us with added flexibility to enhance shareholder value. In summary, our businesses delivered strong results to start the year. Our proven operating capabilities drove strong earnings, robust margin expansion and outstanding free cash flow conversion. With a proven strategy, significant capital deployment capacity and a strong track record of execution, we are confident in our positioning to navigate current trade uncertainties and drive growth and value creation in 2025. I'll now pass it to you, Ken.
Kevin Coleman: Thanks, Dalip. Andrew, could we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. Morning. Dave, could you maybe provide a little bit more detail on what you are seeing specifically in Paragon and the broader group of medical-related businesses, especially given that you explicitly called out Paragon as seemingly seeing a notable inflection in orders after a period of softness in that business after - shortly after you acquired it 1.5 years or so ago. So a little bit more color on Paragon Medical. And then I have a follow-up.
Dave Zapico: Sure, Matt. As you know, Paragon is a business that we acquired a little over a year ago. They specialize in single-use and consumable surgical instruments and implantable components in attractive med tech markets. And as you said, when we bought it, they were - right after that, they went through a destocking. And we took that period of time over the past year to really execute a multiyear improvement plan where we're dramatically improving the cost position of the business. The business is in growing markets that has excellent engineering capability. They have a leading additive manufacturing capability, a substantial number of new program wins. And we just viewed the softness as customers were realigning with the current market environment. There was some overbuying during the prior period. And what we saw in the quarter was very encouraging. The customers are beginning to destock. If you look broader at the OEM automation and the med tech OEM businesses, those businesses that are really the places where we saw the destocking. In sum, those orders were up 25% in the quarter. So across all of those businesses, 25%. And Paragon led all those businesses. So Paragon was greater than 25%, substantially greater than 25%. So the customers are destocking. The business also performed very well on a profit margin basis. It was 25% in the quarter. So we have a new management team there. The business is executing. We're working through some of our business improvement plans. Those orders that we have in the first half of the year are going to lead to us having some substantial growth in the second half of the year. So we're feeling really good about it, and the team is performing very well. And it's good that the market is performing exactly as we thought it would, and we told you about the past few quarters.
Matt Summerville: Thanks, Dave. And just as a follow-up, can you speak more broadly across AMETEK as to the order cadence you've experienced through the first 4 months of the year? Have you seen - and I wouldn't think so given most of what you do is fairly customized to a degree. But are you seeing any sort of buy ahead, any sort of discernible demand destruction? And if you can maybe comment on what price realization looked like in Q1? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I'll take the second part first. I mean, during the quarter, we saw a couple of points of inflation, and we were able to offset that with price. So it was a positive spread. In terms of orders, as I said in the prepared remarks, overall orders were up 8% in the quarter. Organic orders were up 3%. And so that shows continued improvement that we've seen for a third quarter in a row. And sequentially, they were up about 2%, and we have a near record backlog. So that's very good. The cadence in March was the strongest month for orders in the year. So it improved throughout the quarter. And then we started Q2, and we were concerned because of all the tariff things going on, but our orders are still solid. We are really, really good, and we feel good about it. So pretty typical quarter with March being the strongest, and we also had a strong April.
Matt Summerville: Thank you, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Maybe we'll start right where you left off with Matt's question, maybe just the next layer of detail because you're really adept at taking us through key end markets, geographies and really if there's ever been a time where we're interested in the nuances. It sounds like no demand destruction, but just how are you positioned? It looks like the orders have been strong, but any kind of callouts, positives or negatives within geographies and your particular verticals?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. In the geography area, positive growth in the U.S. offset by modest declines internationally. So we're up a bit in the U.S. and just down a bit in Europe and Asia. Our China market was down about 10%. Asia, excluding China, was roughly flat. So it kind of played out how we thought it would, but it was, again, strength in the U.S. offset by just modest declines in other areas. If I go around the horn on our process business, organic sales for that business declined low single digits in the first quarter. Sales were pretty much in line with our expectations, but - and long-term project activity remains solid, but customers are still remaining cautious about when they place the POs given the broader macro uncertainties, and there were some delays in project timing and process. And we now expect organic sales for our process businesses to be roughly flat for the year. Our aerospace and defense business had a strong start to 2025. Organic sales were up mid-single digits in the first quarter. Growth was strongest in our commercial OEM business and our aftermarket business also had a very good quarter as we have content across a broad range of commercial aerospace platforms and aftermarket capabilities really position us well. For the full year in A&D, we continue to expect organic sales to be up mid-single digits. In our third market segment commentary, organic sales for our power business that were up low single digits in the quarter, but solid growth really across our power platform. We continue to manage a strong growth funnel, good new business pipeline, good opportunities in power grid modernization and electrification. We are expecting some cautious customer behavior in the international markets in the near term, given some of the tariff uncertainty. But for the full year, we continue to expect organic sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year. And then lastly, I'll talk about our Automation and Engineered Solutions business. The organic sales were down low single in the quarter, continued solid sequential sales growth. Orders were strong in the quarter. I talked about our OEM customers already as a response to Matt's questions. But clearly, the orders are normalizing with both year-over-year and solid sequential orders growth and highlighted the performance of our Paragon Medical business. And for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth. So we got through the quarter. I mean it was a good quarter, pretty much as expected. Margins were good. Cash flow strength was good. Base earnings were good. Orders continue on a positive strength. Our balance sheet strength is really good. So there's a lot of positives in the first quarter, Deane.
Deane Dray: Yeah. It really does sound that. So I appreciate that color. And just one data point on the tariffs, and that's exactly what we would have expected you to go through all the mitigation plan. Can you just size for us China as a percent - China sourcing as a percent of COGS or just that data point helps us frame what kind of headwind that you're up against.
Dave Zapico: Right. I'll go through the entire tariff mitigation and what we're working on. So and I'll cover China specifically, a couple of different ways, what we're sourcing there and what we're selling there. So it will, I think, be a good summary. We estimate our annual tariff impact, direct impact to tariffs to be about $100 million. And we expect to be able to offset this direct impact through our mitigating actions and that we and that's why we feel comfortable to reaffirm our full year sales and EPS guidance given our strong start to the year and some of the things that I talked about. Now if I break down that $100 million, it comes from really three sources. There's a 10% across-the-board tariffs for all countries. The second component it includes is the 145% tariffs on China imports to the U.S. Now we have fairly limited exposure here given the proactive actions we started back in 2018 to shift sourcing away from China. We've talked about that multiple times over the years. And in fact, the remaining sourcing costs in this category are from recently acquired businesses. So the bulk of AMETEK is not sourcing from China. We're - when we source from China, we sell in China. But we have some new acquisitions that we have to work on, like the Paragon deal, like some of the more recent deals, we're doing some work in China, but it's relatively modest to get that 145% tax on trade. The other element of it is in terms of Mexico. We're glad to find out that we're over - our people have done good work, and we're over 98% compliant with the USMCA guidelines. So very, very little exposure. So we feel really good about our ability to offset the $100 million of direct tariff exposure through our various mitigating actions. Now the other element though, I want to make you aware of is separate from those direct impacts, we have the 125% retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on the U.S. And as you know, we do about 9% of our sales in China. A lot of it is local for local, but we do have approximately 4% of our sales. So in the case of the second quarter, that will be about $70 million. They're direct U.S. to China. And we expect - we're seeing short-term delays here given the magnitude of the tariffs. Our customers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. They're confirming to us that they still want the products, but they're waiting for lower tariff levels. Much of this product is our higher-end instrumentation and optics business, where there's really limited alternatives to AMETEK with similar capability products. And as you may know, we've been very careful to protect our IP for this product for many years. So we're building the product in the U.S. We're shipping it around the globe. Our Chinese customers desire our products. But that $70 million in Q2 is very difficult to predict the outcome near term. And we don't have control over that situation. We may be able to ship it all in Q2. We may not be able to ship it in Q2 because those are risks beyond our control and they're related to country-to-country dynamics. So when we looked at that risk, we have ways to fix it. We understand that some of our products are so specialized that there is a, I'll call it, an opaque process in China where customers can go and get exemptions. We understand that some of our products are qualifying for those exemptions, but we don't - we're monitoring the situation, but we don't have more detail than that. We're also initiating an element of a manufacturing localization plan that will change the value-added nature of some of our production processes so that we don't run into this problem. So we're going to use our footprint to change some sourcing, some assemblies, some test and calibration processes. So we get substantial transformation in markets that aren't subject to tariffs. And finally, with the - I mean we can sell these products to - outside of China. This isn't an issue where we can't sell them there. They're just in the queue, they've been started. There's $70 million planned for it for Q2. So we're really dealing with a shorter-term issue here. And how that's going to turn out in Q2, I'm not certain. It could turn out well. It could be delayed. We're comfortable that we can offset the problem in the year. Over the balance of the year, we feel very good with a very good plan that I can talk a little bit more about. But that is the issue that we're dealing with very near term in terms of Q2, and it could swing either way. It could go in Q2, it could shift to Q3. We just got uncomfortable dealing with the uncertainty in the near term with something we didn't really control. And that's why we're confident in the year, but that the swing between Q2 and Q3, we're not certain enough.
Deane Dray: Dave, that all sounds like you've got it dialed in, right? We understand these are extenuating circumstances, but you guys have been through this before, at least in terms of supply chain challenges. We appreciate all the color here. Thank you and best of luck.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist.
Jamie Cook: Hi. Good morning and nice quarter. I guess, Dave, my question, if you look at the spread, obviously, the EMG margins had been under pressure relative to history for reasons we all know. But I'm just wondering with some of the positive momentum you're seeing in the orders for that segment and in particular, Paragon with some of the cost actions you've taken, as orders and sales start to improve, how do we think about the margin trajectory for that business? I guess that's my first question. And my second question, obviously, acquisitions is your specialty. Just wondering if - just given the complexity around trade war and tariffs and all that type of stuff, if some of the larger acquisitions that you guys had been contemplating if that's sort of on hold at this point? And then just last, administrative. I think you guys usually guide 1 quarter out, and I don't think you guided for the second quarter. So I just want to know if I missed anything. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. No, Jamie, you didn't. And really the response to Deane in my prior question, the uncertainty around the Q2 sales and whether that shift to later in the year is why we didn't guide for Q2. So we reaffirmed the year, but we did not guide to Q2 because of the uncertainty. Related to the Paragon margins, we're going to see upside in the second half of the year for sure because we're continuing to work through our improvement plans, and now we have some volume. So we have some upside in margins for sure in Paragon in the second half of the year. And...
Jamie Cook: And I guess I'm thinking EMG in total, like just the spread between EMG, IMG, obviously, Powered and EMG.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think that the way EIG margins are extremely good, and they're performing extremely well. I think if you want to think about it from your perspective, we have a hedge on EMG margins. We - there's some upside there and given the acceleration in that business. And then the third thing you talked about.
Jamie Cook: It was just M&A, like unfold, yeah...
Dave Zapico: We have a very, very robust pipeline, and we're very active in the pipeline. Some of the deals, the uncertain nature of it, there's been some delays. Some of them are going forward. And we have - over the history of time, we've been buyers in up markets and down markets, and we've been able to buy some of the best businesses, the best returns for our shareholders in down markets. So we're very active. If you think about this thing, I mean, we're ideally positioned to deal in this changing environment. We're very good operators. We've been through challenges before, as we talked about with Deane. We've got an experienced management team. We've got a distributed operating structure that really empowers local management. We have our portfolio of essential mission-critical businesses that allow us to pass through higher input costs. I mean, we expect to differentiate our performance and M&A is going to be part of that. It's very difficult to predict if we sign a deal in a couple of weeks or we sign a deal at the end of the year. But we're not backing off at all. And we're in the fortunate position that we can do two things at once. And we're going after M&A, and we also have a balance sheet in periods of dislocation, we've used our balance sheet to initiate buybacks also.
Jamie Cook: Thank you very much. And great job.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Thanks, Jamie.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague: Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Morning, Jeff.
Dalip Puri: Good morning.
Jeff Sprague: Dave, thanks for that super detailed kind of tariff rundown. I wonder if you could just give us the punchline though, like China specifically, what is it that you're looking to overcome there on that 145%?
Dave Zapico: Well, the 145% is built into the $100 million. And so it's 125% - well, you got U.S. on the supply chain, it's 145. That's within the $100 million, and that's fairly small. So again, we just have a couple of recent acquisitions. So that goes into the $100 million. And [indiscernible] saying the $100 million is the total amount of things going to the U.S.
Jeff Sprague: Got it. And then just thinking about this possible shipping delay in Q2, and I appreciate the guidance uncertainty it creates. We should just assume that's very high incremental margin business, though, right? I would guess that throws $0.10 or more of sort of variance in an all else equal construct as it relates to Q2.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think that's - I think you're thinking about it the right way. It's our high-end products. That capability is not available for many places in the world. And it's higher-margin business, and I think you're thinking about it right.
Jeff Sprague: And we've gotten some inbound questions just about your research exposure and those risk and anything that along those lines. Could you just address what, if anything, you're seeing there and what your exposure is?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. The total research exposure is about 10% of sales. It's international. And a lot of the - those stuff has been in a lot of life science research, and we have some exposure there, but not much. So there are some delays with our government customers. But at this point, for us, it's relatively modest.
Jeff Sprague: And then just maybe last for me. Just on price, can you share - sorry if I missed it, what price was in the quarter? And I don't think you changed the organic growth outlook, but I would assume your outlook implicitly would now include some more price maybe with some volume detraction on the economic uncertainties.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. You're exactly right. And when we rolled up the whole year, the volume was down a little bit, but the pricing was up a little bit and as part of our tariff mitigation plan, and we felt comfortable keeping the full year guide to plus low single digits accurately. In terms of the specific price, we're not going to give out that specific number, but I can tell you that we covered all inflationary costs in Q1. We had a good positive spread, and we expect that to continue throughout the year.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Can we just talk about just particularly on Test and Measurement side. We've heard a lot of concerns, and these are broad macro concerns that a lot of the components that go into the high-end instrumentation are sourced by many in the industry in China. And I think you guys have done a fairly good job, as you pointed out, of adjusting your supply chain away from China over the past 5, 6, 7 years. What kind of opportunities does it create, right? Because there are these big concerns that shipments are going to come to grinding halt in May. You guys seem to have better supply chains. I would imagine on the margin, some of your competition in the U.S. does come internationally. Could you just describe the opportunity set that, that creates for you?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Really, it's a great question, Andrew. We have a good structure, good bones to deal with the situation. We have 100 plants approximately in the U.S., and we have 50 internationally. And we're already working with some customers that we haven't worked with in the past on some opportunities in the U.S. to use our infrastructure in the U.S. to be able to win market share. So there's a - we're clearly focused on the tariff mitigation, but there are opportunities to using our structure in the U.S. And I think that, that structure of 50 plants outside the U.S. really gives us some flexibility to look at localization at a different level and the transformation of the value add so that as we move through the course of the year, we're going to be able to mitigate the impact of tariffs. So I think it's a comprehensive plan. Dalip and I reviewed the - one of the things we've done a good job with the year is being a great operating system, great business system, but providing a structure and then getting all of our teams to execute within it, and we learned from that. So Dalip and I went through plans with every one of our businesses, and we're going to continue that for a period of time. And there were plans in the business, and it talked about the tariff mitigation. It talked about sourcing changes. It talked about select pricing opportunities. It talked about going on offense. And we spent a lot of time understanding where our competitors are located and where we're located in areas of advantage that we're going to have in the new structure. And we're working on those now, and we're getting positive playback from our customers.
Andrew Obin: And just a follow-up question. Given this new round of tariffs, how are you and the Board thinking about manufacturing footprint, your supply chain? Because clearly, you've made major adjustments in the aftermath of the first wave. What, if any, adjustments just directionally, you and the Board are thinking longer term? And the follow-up question on that is, what are you guys doing to your CapEx spending this year? Is it going up? Or is it going down? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think the Board is very pleased that we started to reduce our risk from China supply chain 5 years ago. And we're constantly acquiring businesses. So we're working on exiting those businesses, and that's in process. I think in terms of our manufacturing footprint, I just think having expanded localization in various countries so that longer term, we're less dependent on some of the tariffs is the right thing to do. So we're not changing maybe where we build the core technology, but we're shifting the value add to more and more locales around the world. And we've been doing that over time. That's why we have 50 plants outside the U.S. That's why we've been so successful in these international markets, almost, I think, in the quarter, high 40% sales were for international markets, and we're going to continue doing that. So we think that's the right strategy, the right plan. In terms of CapEx, we're not reducing our CapEx. We have some very aggressive digital programs going on right now. We have - we're looking to improve our sourcing with AI. We're looking to improve our e-commerce capabilities. So we have some very, very long-term strategic plans that are around improving our capability through software investments, and we're going to continue those. And we also have - we have a good footprint already. So it's largely effectively utilizing that footprint. So I feel good about that. And I see no reason at this time to change our capital spending plan.
Andrew Obin: Thanks so much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho.
Brett Linzey: Hey. Good morning, all.
Dave Zapico: Hey, Brett.
Brett Linzey: Yeah, I wanted to come back to the destocking comment around automation Engineered Solutions. Perhaps just an update on the level of OEM inventory in some of those channels. And then anything in terms of the pulse on capital projects? Are you seeing any shift in time lines as it relates to some of those businesses?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. In terms of the time lines, I talked about a little bit in our process business. We are - we're not seeing projects canceled, but we're seeing uncertainty and some projects are delayed. And we made an adjustment in our annual outlook related to that business because of that. So that's definitely happening. You had another question...
Brett Linzey: Yeah, the OEM inventory.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. What we're seeing is that the destock is not completed for all customers. But once it ends, then you see a pop. And those customers are recalibrating to the demand levels. So - and you're going to see that as we work through the course of 2024. So by 2025, excuse me, by the time '25 - '25 is completely over, I think all the destocking will be done. I was thinking - but it's starting to happen now, and it's driving growth strong orders in the first quarter.
Brett Linzey: Okay. Got it. And I guess just a quick follow-up there. So I guess the assumption for the year from a planning perspective is that persists through the balance of the year? Or does it improve in the second half? Any thoughts there?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. You're talking about our sales? Are you talking about orders? Or are you talking about what part of our business?
Brett Linzey: Just talking about the level of inventory, like when do you think that gets worked down and what kind of normalized.
Dave Zapico: Okay. Yeah, I think in the automation area, that's working itself through. We're seeing the U.S. is kind of, I'll call it, finished. Some of the destocking is still occurring in Europe, places like Germany. So that's automation. In terms of the med tech OEMs, I think it's OEM dependent. And they all have different supply chains and they're good at running their business, but they seem to not really have a very tight control on their inventory. So we're seeing - it's difficult to predict. It's difficult for them to predict and it's difficult for us to predict because of that. But you're seeing as they work through their process, the destock is ending, and there's more normalization of inventory. And we saw a big chunk of that in Q1. And that's like what we saw with the Paragon orders, right? Paragon orders were up much, much more than 25% in Q1. And that was customers getting to the point where they're recalibrating, they're normalized and they're setting their plan for the year. And as we go through the year, we're going to see other med tech customers do that. But it's happening as we thought it would.
Brett Linzey: Appreciate the insight. And then maybe just one more on A&D. Not much ground was covered here. How are those businesses performing versus expectations? And is your thinking and outlook changed between commercial and defense based on any developments we've seen?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. We're still feeling really good about the aerospace business. It grew mid-single digits in the quarter. We're expecting it to grow mid-single digits for the year with balanced growth across both our Commercial segment and our Defense segment. When I think about the Commercial segment, you have the OEM multiyear backlogs that was - that drove a significant part of our growth in Q1, and they have 8, 10-year backlogs depending on what you look at. So we feel good about that. And in the Defense area, the funding is solid, and we feel good about that. In terms of the aftermarket, a lot of older planes are flying now because there's been some delays on this OEM side, and that plays to our strength with slower fleet retirements. And that business is a good domestic business, but also a good international business. And older planes are flying. There's - in the U.S., there's some dislocation now with the airlines, but they're still flying the planes. They're flying older planes. Fuel costs are coming down. And the dynamic there is if we don't get the OEM sale, it's okay because we have such a strong aftermarket presence. And that team running that business is just doing a great job for us. So for us, and we're in some niches in this aerospace business, it's about 17%, 18% of our company. But I would say it's very stable, strong, growing business for us right now.
Brett Linzey: Appreciate all the details always. Thanks a lot.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Brett.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners.
Scott Graham: Yeah, hey. Good morning, all and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to maybe unbundle aerospace and defense a little bit. I know you just did a little bit more just now, Dave. But when you went through your prepared or the question-and-answer period with A&D, you didn't specifically talk about defense. And I know that, that business has been a little bit flat to down the last couple of quarters. Are you suggesting that defense kind of gets better in the second half of the year? And then my follow-up on that would also be on the aerospace side, I know you just indicated that you're comfortable with your aftermarket business. But obviously, there's some passenger weariness to travel, and I'm wondering how that might roll into the second half.
Dave Zapico: Yeah, great question. Specifically on defense, we're expecting growth - balanced growth across all subsegments. So we're expecting defense to grow in the second half of the year, and we'll see what gets passed in Congress and things, but it's pretty optimistic right now. So I think we're well positioned there, and there's long-term threats, obviously. In terms of the aftermarket, you're exactly right. I mean you're seeing some airlines with some stress. And - but again, that's why I was - the planes are still flying. And older planes, in particular, are flying longer because fleet retirements have slowed. And I just think that it's - our aerospace business and aftermarket is a U.S. and international business. In our international business, we have operations all over. So I have a feeling that if the U.S. slows, the international market will strengthen or will stay strong because they're in a little bit different cycles. But right now, what we're looking at is all sides of the business are strong.
Scott Graham: Thank you. I just wanted to also ask, if I could, about capital allocation. You seem to have a little bit more jump in your speech when you're talking about capital. It seemed like you're a little bit more excited about M&A and then talked about share repurchases a bit more than you've talked about in the past. You have a lot of capital to deploy, your net leverage number is very low, obviously. And I was just wondering, on the M&A side, are you seeing bid-ask spreads kind of get a little bit more favorable? And on the share repurchase side, do you see being more active this year?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think that we're well positioned, Scott. I mean we have - as you said, our net debt-to-EBITDA is 0.7. And - when you go through just locations like this a couple of times in your career, you realize that opportunities are going to be there, and we're working with people. I think good assets are still demanding good prices. So it's not like you're seeing tremendous bargains. They've come in a bit. But we have a really good pipeline. We have a good reputation. We're working with some people. There's a lot of processes going on. And I think that we're just in an ideal position to acquire some businesses and also act on the dislocation in stock price that could be occurring. And when I put the two together, in a time where you may be on your back foot, we're not on our back foot. So springing our steps forward lean. So I think you got that right. And this is a time where we can differentiate our performance.
Scott Graham: Thank you, Dave.
Dave Zapico: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks. I just wanted to kind of follow on that acquisition topic that's come up a couple of times. And obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty, maybe more on our side of the phone than what you guys appear to be seeing to date at least with the comments around April and 1Q being okay. Have the conversations around acquisitions changed? I mean there's uncertainty on cost, a little bit of uncertainty in the demand environment. Do you have to wait until you get clarity? Do you - just how do you kind of approach that uncertainty from a valuation and/or closing standpoint? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yeah, it's a great question, Rob. It's deal specific. So for example, if you're going to acquire a business that has a huge supply chain from China, that may be a wait right now and delay because you see how that thing is going to play out. But then deal specific, you have other dynamics. So - and we've been doing this for a long time. It is an uncertain time, especially when you look at it month-to-month, but we're looking at it in the long term. And we've been through this before, and there's going to be - there are opportunities arising. And that's - we got some issues we're managing through. We talked about them. We have a tremendous amount of detail on them. But overall, I think that we're well positioned to do well. And I think that you're correct that some deals are moving ahead. Some deals have been a sideline for a period of time, but because of the trade dynamics, but there's enough in our pipeline that we're still working aggressively on them. So does that answer your question, Rob?
Rob Wertheimer: It does. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.
Dave Zapico: Hello, Joe.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Dan on for Joe. And I had a question on commercial aerospace. So you spoke about obviously U.S. travel volumes potentially declining, but you mentioned that international might remain strong. But in terms of actions that the airlines are taking, one of the major airline companies spoke about reducing maintenance spend. Is that something that you see broadly in the industry? Or is that something that would impact you guys later? Basically, any color on what you're hearing from customers or how something like that would impact your business?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think that the impact on our business is relatively muted. The aftermarket piece of the business is a smaller part compared to the OE piece of the business and compared to the defense business. We could see a downturn in that part of the business. We're not seeing it now, but we're very diversified in some specific areas. And there is a future downturn, we'll deal with it. But right now, it's not happening. That's a fact in our business.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. I appreciate that. Thank you. And I apologize if this has been asked, I joined the call a bit late, but are you seeing any prebuys broadly in the market? And specifically for you guys, was any part of your mitigation actions for tariffs that include you yourself prebuying?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think that we build customized products. So we didn't see - there could be some prebuying, but we didn't see a lot of it. So I think that we'd see that less than most, but there could have been some there. In terms of inventory purchases, we're certainly doing the smart things. And we have operators in our distributed model that are very, very - that run their businesses like they own them. And if they think they want to bring some inventory in because it makes sense, they're making those decisions.
Unidentified Analyst: Appreciate. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Buscaglia: David, I wanted to ask you, your backlog has been at record levels almost every quarter now going back as far as I remember. So I'm curious what gets this backlog to convert? Presumably, tariffs are now kind of delaying that conversion. Well, maybe you're not seeing that, but that's the thought I had. I guess this is very unique to AMETEK, and it sets you up pretty interestingly once it does start to convert. So kind of what gets it going in your mind?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think that the backlog is at high levels. It's - there are some delays related to tariffs. We talked about some of the delays for the products that we're shipping directly to China. We're talking about other situations where the tariffs are causing customers to go back and have to get more money to buy products. So I think the tariffs are going to cause some delays. And I think we have a good tariff mitigation plan. We have good localization plans. And there's some comfort in having that backlog as we navigate through this thing over the next - in terms of the coming quarters. And - but you're right, there are some delays caused by the tariffs.
Andrew Buscaglia: And where are you noticing, I don't know, any patterns in the last few quarters where the backlog specifically is building? It sounds like A&D, even some of your medical stuff, but is there a concentration in one area that you're seeing? Or can you talk a little bit more about the color within that backlog?
Dave Zapico: No, I don't think it's concentrated. I think you hit the areas. I mean, A&D backlog is a longer cycle business. It's strong. I think the big change is the med tech with Paragon backlog is increasing.
Andrew Buscaglia: Yeah, okay. All right. Thanks, David.
Dave Zapico: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'll now hand the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Kevin Coleman, for any closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thanks again, Andrew, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2024 AMETEK Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Kevin Coleman.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and welcome to AMETEK's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dalip Puri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2023 or 2024 results or to 2024 guidance will be on an adjusted basis excluding after tax acquisition-related intangible amortization and excluding a pretax of $29.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share charge in the first quarter of 2024 for integration costs related to the Paragon Medical acquisition. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust margin expansion, outstanding cashflow generation, strong organic orders growth and double-digit growth in earnings per share. In the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income, EBITDA and diluted earnings per share as well as for operating cash flow and free cash flow. We also repurchased $155 million in shares during the quarter and this morning we announced the acquisition of Kern Microtechnik for approximately €105 million. Our performance this quarter marks the culmination of a strong year in which we leveraged the proven strength of our operating model to deliver outstanding results despite a challenging economic environment. Now let me turn to our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.76 billion up 2% from the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down 3%, acquisitions added 5 points in the quarter and foreign currency was flat. Orders were solid in the quarter with organic orders up 4% versus the prior year with positive organic growth across both our EIG and EMG segments. And we ended the quarter with a strong backlog of $3.4 billion. AMETEK's operating performance in the fourth quarter was excellent. Our operating income in the quarter was a record $469 million a 5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating margins were 26.6% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year, while core margins, which excluded the dilutive impact from acquisitions were up a sizable 140 basis points. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $561 million up 7% versus the prior year with EBITDA margins an impressive 31.9%. This operating performance led to robust cash generation with free cash flow a record $498 million in the quarter, up 4% versus last year's fourth quarter and free cash flow to net income conversion of 129%. Diluted earnings per share were a record $1.87 up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.81 to $1.06 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter with impressive margin expansion and operating margin levels that reflect the high quality of our businesses. EIG sales were $1.2 billion down 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 3% and acquisitions added 1 point. Growth was strongest across our Aerospace and Defense businesses, while our Advanced Optical Metrology businesses, Zygo also saw solid growth in the quarter. Similar to last year, our EIG businesses experienced some project delays in the fourth quarter as customers remain cautious at year end. We view these as temporary delays as the new project pipeline remains strong. EIG operating income was a record $386.6 million up 8% versus the prior year and operating margins were also a record 31.8%, up a robust 280 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also finished the year with strong operating performance. EMG's fourth quarter sales were $540 million [Technical Difficulty] from the prior year with organic sales down 4%. Strong performance in our Aerospace and Defense businesses was offset by weaknesses in our OEM exposed businesses, which continued to face headwinds from inventory destocking. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $111.2 million down 1% compared to the prior year period, while EMG's fourth quarter operating margins were 20.3%. Now for the full year, overall performance was strong in 2024 as we established annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.940 billion up 5% from 2023. Operating income for 2024 was $1.81 billion up 6% and operating margins were 26.1% for the full year, up 20 basis points from the prior year with core margins up 120 basis points. EBITDA for the year was $2.18 billion up 8% with EBITDA margins a very strong 31.4%. Full year 2024 earnings were $6.83 per diluted share, up 7% versus the prior year. We also delivered exceptional cash flows in 2024 with free cash flow up 6% versus the prior year and free cash flow to net-to-net income conversion of very strong 124%. AMETEK's performance in 2024 underscores the quality of our businesses, the flexibility of our operating model and the outstanding contributions from all AMETEK colleagues. Our teams navigated a complex macroeconomic environment and delivered strong results, while also ensuring AMETEK is well positioned for long-term success. Now turning to capital deployment and acquisitions. As noted in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $155 million in shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to approximately $220 million. While our top priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions, our strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to also opportunistically repurchase shares. Subsequent to the end of first quarter, we acquired Kern Microtechnik, which we announced this morning. Kern is a leading manufacturer of high-precision machining and optical inspection solutions that achieve industry leading accuracy and surface finish. Kern's highly engineered solutions help customers produce highly complex and precise components used in semiconductor, med tech, space and other high-tech industries. Kern is a strong strategic fit with our Alta Precision Technologies business, expanding our existing capabilities in Ultra High Precision manufacturing and opening up new opportunities to serve customers with growing demands for miniaturization and accuracy. Headquartered near Munich, Germany, Kearns has annual sales of approximately €50 million. I'm excited to welcome all Kern colleagues to the AMETEK family. Looking ahead to 2025, we are managing a strong pipeline of high-quality acquisition candidates. We have a healthy and flexible balance sheet providing us the opportunity to deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions. With our robust balance sheet, significant financial capacity and disciplined approach to capital deployment, AMETEK is well positioned to continue driving long-term value through our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to invest in our businesses to best position them for long-term growth. In 2024, we invested approximately $90 million in incremental growth investments largely across research, development and engineering and sales and marketing functions to support their organic growth initiatives. We expect to invest approximately $85 million in incremental growth investments in 2025. These investments and initiatives have strengthened our leadership positions within our niche markets, helped open up new growth opportunities in attractive adjacent markets and accelerated our new product development and technology innovation. One such example of our technology innovation successes can be found in our latest Innovation Award winner at CAMECA. CAMECA 's LEAP series of atom probe microscopes provide 3D imaging and chemical composition characterization of materials at the nanoscale. Historically, the LEAP product line focused on material science and geology applications targeted at highly knowledgeable academic customers at PhD level. CAMECA determined that an enhanced productivity system with high sensitivity and improved yield will broaden the market and support both academic and industrial customers who put a premium on throughput, automation and analytical capability. This led to the development of the new LEAP 6000XR, which provides enhanced ease of use, new automation features for data collection and an improved analytical capabilities. With this new technology, Atom Probe Tomography is now used to study nearly all classes of solid materials from the oldest minerals on earth to the most advanced aerospace alloys. As a result, new applications are emerging due to CAMECA's customer centric approach to innovation. Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. We remain cautious as we start the year given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. However, we are encouraged by the strength in orders we experienced in the second half of the year, our strong backlog, our leading positions across a diverse set of markets which are poised for improved growth and our significant capital available to deploy on strategic acquisitions. For 2025, we expect both overall and organic sales to increase low single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2024. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $7.02 to $7.18 up 3% to 5% compared to last year's results. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year first quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.67 to $1.69 per share, up 2% to 3% versus the prior year. To summarize, AMETEK delivered a strong finish to the year with solid performance in the fourth quarter reflecting the strength of our portfolio and our ability to execute our growth strategy in a sluggish macro environment. Our differentiated technologies and deep industry expertise continue to position us well in attractive niche markets, providing a solid foundation for future growth. With a focus on innovation, operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation, we are confident in our ability to drive continued growth and create long term value for our shareholders in 2025 and beyond. I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri to cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Dalip?
Dalip Puri: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK had a strong finish to 2024, establishing records for sales, operating income, earnings per share and cash flow in the quarter. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2025. Starting with general and administrative expenses. Fourth quarter G&A expenses were $28.9 million up $2.5 million from the prior year. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up approximately $5 million. As a percentage of sales G&A expense was 1.5%, in line with 2023 levels. For 2025, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales. Fourth quarter other operating expenses were down $1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due to lower due diligence costs. For 2025, we expect other operating expenses to be largely in line with 2024 level. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 12.8%, down from 17.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to statute expirations. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 17.3%, which was in line with our guidance range of 17% to 17.5%. For 2025, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the fourth quarter and $127 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2025 are expected to be approximately $155 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $96 million and for the full year was $383 million. In 2025, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million including after tax, acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $194 million or $0.83 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 16.8% of sales. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record at $550 million up 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Free cash flow was also a record in the quarter, up 4% to $498 million with excellent free cash flow conversion of 129% for the quarter. Free cash flow for 2024 was a record $1.7 billion up 6% versus the prior year, with full year free cash flow conversion also very strong at 124% of net income. For 2025, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 115%. Total debt at year end was $2.1 billion down $1.2 billion from the end of 2023. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $374 million. As Dave noted, we spent approximately $155 million on share repurchases in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to approximately $220 million. Additionally, subsequent to the end of fourth quarter, we deployed approximately €105 million on the acquisition of Kern Microtechnik. At the end of 2024, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9x and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.8x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity with approximately $2.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our acquisition strategy and growth initiatives. In summary, we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year 2024 operating results, highlighted by record earnings, robust margins and excellent cash flow generation. With a proven strategy, significant capital deployment capacity and a strong track record of execution, we are well positioned to navigate current trade uncertainties and to drive growth and value creation in 2025. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thanks, Dalip. Andrew, can we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning, David. Maybe could you talk a little bit about the nature of delays you saw within EIG? And if you started to see some of that break now that we're into February? And then maybe if you could also comment on your views regarding the remaining duration of the OEM destocking, you're continuing to see in EMG? And then I have a follow-up.
Dave Zapico: Sure, Matt. Good morning. The project delays in ERG were pretty much what we've been seeing. It was across the board. It wasn't really notable, but we got some delays on the shipments, but the orders were good. And similar, the destocking headwinds largely impacted our OEM exposed businesses in EMG, which include our Automation and Engineered Solutions sub segment. And but we're starting to see improved order patterns from some OEM customers, while others are taking a little time to destock. We were encouraged by the sequential orders growth in Paragon. We have substantial double digit orders growth. We're also encouraged by the orders in EIG, so both groups were up organically in orders and very positive from that viewpoint and the order strength continued into January. So we're not through the destocking, some customers are through it, some are not, but you can see it definitely easing a bit as we go forward.
Matt Summerville: A follow-up, David, can you talk about where you were with price cost in '24, what your views on that are for '25 and what you see as AMETEK's ultimate level of price capture this year?
Dave Zapico: Thanks. Sure. I think in 2024, the last quarter we ended up pretty much in line with what we were performing throughout the year. We captured a bit more than three and our inflation was a little bit more than two. And going into 2025, we've been pretty conservative in budgeting that we're saying that we'll offset increased price with inflation by a little bit. So we think the environment for inflation, at least what we're seeing is mitigated to a great degree and I think you're in that 1.5% to 2% number for the pricing.
Matt Summerville: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David, could you give us a little bit more of an update on Paragon? You mentioned orders were firming up here as we exited the year. Can you just level set us on where we're at revenue base for that business and what you are expecting in 2025?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I mean, to remind everyone, we acquired a business, it's in the med tech space, it manufactures single use and consumable surgical instruments and implantable components in markets with good growth rates, long-term growing markets, excellent engineering capability, leading additive manufacturing capability and a lot of new program wins, which we continue to execute through 2024. In 2024, they're going through a destocking of their customers, but as I said, some of their customers are destocked and they started the order aggressively, but some of the customers are not through the destocking. The net effect of that is sequentially we saw a significant double digit increase in order input. We remain excited about the business. It's the end demand in procedures within their surgical and orthopedic markets remain strong. So we know it's truly a destock as the end procedures are continuing and the inventory is being consumed and we're gaining share with these new programs. So we're investing in the long-term growth that they continue to win new programs. So we also have a combined management team leading Paragon, combination of AMETEK and legacy Paragon management team is functioning well. As I said, the inventory normalization continues to impact the business, but we're working through it. So we're encouraged by that sequential orders growth.
Jeff Sprague: Dave, just to put a finer point on that. So, could we end the year then somewhere around $420 million-ish of revenues in Paragon?
Dave Zapico: Exactly, exactly, Jeff. We're in that ballpark. I'm not going to give the exact number, but you're right on the pen there and we expect that business to grow higher than AMETEK as we move throughout the year and especially in the second half.
Jeff Sprague: And not to overly drill on Paragon, but also just given the restructuring and everything you did last year in the business, can you give us an idea of kind of maybe order of magnitude of margin improvement you're looking for there?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think from where they're at now, which is the substantial improvement in the next 12 months and that will be it's biased towards the second half, but it will definitely happen and it will be well in excess of the 20 or 30 basis points of margin improvement we're looking at for the whole company, well in excess of that.
Jeff Sprague: Great. I'll pass the baton. Thanks a lot guys.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities.
Jamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my first question, understanding, the orders have continued to improve, there's some concern out there from investors that the improvement we're seeing in the industrial economy was more of a pre buy based on concerns post election. It doesn't sound like you're seeing any of that, but if you could just comment sort of on the cadence of orders, whether there was anything unusual. And then I guess my second question, understanding you're guiding to, I think you said low single digit growth, it sounds like we're flat in the first quarter. Just trying to understand the cadence of growth that you're expecting again just given some of the uncertainty on the macro? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Sure. In terms of the cadence for orders, we had a pretty typical quarter where the orders increased every month of the quarter, but and December was the strongest month for the orders, but that's typical cadence, but also for the whole year, December was the strongest month. So that was a good order month. And then in January, that same orders positive orders continued. So the last really since the middle of last year, we started to see an improvement in orders, it's definitely continuing and our customers aren't telling us is to pre buy us to get ahead of tariffs or anything, but it could be, you don't know, but it feels pretty strong from our viewpoint. And as those orders make their way into our backlog, those will make their way into sales as we go forward. We're starting out the year flat as you mentioned. As we move throughout the year, the destock will mitigate and we have good pipelines. So it's a conservative or prudent start to the year is the way we're looking at it.
Jamie Cook: Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Jamie.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas.
Dave Zapico: You're breaking up. Andrew, why don't we put him on hold and we'll go to the next caller.
Operator: Certainly. One moment please. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho.
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning all. Just want to come back to the project comments, the softness at the end of the year. It sounds like the pipeline is building and maybe strong, so front log looks pretty good. Are customers giving you any indication on the timing of when these projects might release? And how are you thinking about ES, Engineered Solutions, backlog conversion as part of the guidance construct?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think that we have a really good pipeline and it's going to play out in 2025 and expecting to see projects that have been delayed are now moving. In terms of the A&ES piece of the business, I think that's where we're suffering from the OEM destock the most. And I think in the automation side of the business, we've bottomed and it's a great place to grow from where we're at right now. And on the med tech side of the business, we've already started to see the destock abate. So that's where we are and that will play out in our guidance throughout the year and we expect those two businesses to do better as we progress throughout the year.
Brett Linzey: Okay, great. And maybe just shifting over to Aerospace and Defense, could you give us an update on how you're thinking about the outlook on aero versus defense? I know a lot of moving pieces there. And then anything to think about in terms of profitability as we shift to more OE versus aftermarket and what you're embedding there in the guide for the year? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Sure. Our A&D business, it had another strong year and in the fourth quarter it was up mid-single digits, it was up high single digits for the year, mid-single digits for the quarter. Growth in the fourth quarter was strongest across our commercial businesses. So we already saw the OE component of the sales go up in the fourth quarter, we make a lot of money on OE, a lot of money on aftermarket, so I don't think there's a margin concern there. We think in 2025, it's going to grow at mid-single digits and we're seeing strength in both our commercial and defense markets. So commercial may be a bit stronger than defense, but both of those will be healthy growers in 2025.
Brett Linzey: All right. Appreciate the insight.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So margin performance was very strong, especially given just the soft core environment. I wonder, can you just talk in general about how you approached cost and margin through the quarter? Was this a bit of a batten down the hatches? Is this normal improvement flowing through? Is acquisition improvement flowing through? Maybe just characterize how you see the margin improve in the quarter?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think the it's AMETEK operational excellence. We had an excellent operating quarter. We have reported margins were up 90 points and core margins were up 140 basis points. And we got good productivity, we got good positive price cost, good mix. So it was a good quarter for margins, but we've been delivering good margins for year after year for a long time. I mean for the year, our core margins were up 120 basis points and I don't see any reason that that's going to stop. It's our DNA. We're constantly working on operational excellence programs and we're executing them and we have high contribution margin businesses that are contributing to it. So the margin performance was good, it was very good. We had some records that we set, but it was kind of expected.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay, perfect. So nothing dramatic and negative. This one may be a little tricky to answer because there's obviously a lot of back and forth going on in government policy right now. But is there any hiccups or stutters you're seeing in potential future demand or current demand from funding that might flow through to laboratories, test measurement, scientific instruments and so forth? And I'll stop there. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I don't see any specific thing that's going to hurt the laboratory demand. I mean, I will say one thing about the laboratory demand, it's very strong internationally right now. So that's driving it more so than the U.S. When I think about the overall regulatory environment, I think some of the things with the new administration are positive. We have regulatory relief, we're looking forward to projects moving ahead faster. There's a different approach to antitrust. We have a focus on energy development, that's good for us. There's an increased focus on military spending and that's good for us. There's lower taxes for products manufactured in the U.S., we do a lot of manufacturing in the U.S., there's tax breaks plan to boost equipment investment. So I think a lot of those pro-growth policies can be really positive for us. And as a U.S. manufacturer with a lot of capability in the U.S. with a significant U.S. manufacturing footprint provides many options and opportunities depending how the situation develops. We have a flexible asset light model, consistent with our strategy and we think as we get throughout this year, we'll see some opportunities develop.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Yes, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Hello, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Just to clarify, what's organic growth rate that's embedded in your first quarter guidance?
Dave Zapico: Let me see. We it's a flattish number, Andrew. So both the total sales and organic sales were flat.
Andrew Obin: Okay. So we are accelerating organically from fourth quarter to the Q1?
Dave Zapico: Yes, we're going from the -2, -3 to a flat. So the organic growth is accelerating from Q4 to Q1 and is tied to the acceleration in order input to organic orders. So, I think that's going to continue throughout the year. So as those organic orders were strong, our sequential quarters, the organic growth will be increased versus fourth quarter and it's just a continuation of a slow acceleration to the year.
Andrew Obin: Got you. And just sort of combining the two questions, first, how did you all this tariff noise, do we see it in the guidance? And also how does FX impact your 2025 outlook because you are a meaningful U.S. exporter? So how should we think about the impact both on the revenue and margin? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes, they're good questions. And the guidance we have taken into account, the things that we've heard about over the last few days, few weeks, but we've been making contingency plans since shortly after the elections for tariffs. And our 2017 and 2018 playbook is relevant. That's when we executed a China for China manufacturing strategy and decoupled our supply chains from China, we executed flawlessly and we're ready to do the same thing now if it's required. We manufacture niche, highly differentiated products. We plan to pass on the cost impact of the tariffs if the tariffs get enacted to our customers as we have done previously. We have a significant U.S. manufacturing footprint, as I said, as a flexible asset light model, so we're very agile. And I think that we're well positioned to manage through the current environment. I mean our guidance doesn't take into account, doesn't assume a broader economic slowdown because of an escalating trade war to be clear with that, no demand destruction is assumed in our budget. But with everything that we know of and with our past success and decoupling our supply chains from China and with our operational capability, we think we're ready for this and we got it covered.
Dalip Puri: And Andrew on foreign exchange, obviously we're a global business, but we are primarily a U.S. dollar centric business. So our top line is not overly exposed to foreign exchange. And we have a very balanced foreign exchange footprint at the profit and cash flow level through natural offsets. So we can very much we're not impacted by broad based U.S. dollar movement. And I think the last few years, you've seen a lot of FX volatility and it hasn't impacted our bottom line.
Andrew Obin: All right. Thanks so much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. A lot of ground covered. Just curious on current, Dave, how you think about the size of the addressable market? What's the competition like and how long you've been looking at that business?
Dave Zapico: Sure, Chris. It's part of our Ultra Precision Technology division and we bought a business in that part of our company about 15 years ago named Precitech and they build what's called diamond turning machines that make these surfaces that are incredibly precise optical surfaces and the business has done extremely well for AMETEK. And we look at Kern as kind of a sister company with some different technology. And we think Kern is they also do submicron level accuracy systems. Their end markets are places that need exceptional levels of precision. That includes the medical market, the semiconductor market, the research market, the space market and there's a lot of opportunities to us to grow this business and running them as sister companies with our Precitech business. We have capabilities that solves a bigger set of solutions for the customers. It's typical AMETEK acquisition, highly differentiated, high precision, leader in niches, really works for the miniaturization that's going on in the technology world. We got a fair price worth, management team is staying with us and we think it's going to be a good acquisition and most of the sales are exported outside of Germany. They're a German company, but over 70% of their sales are all outside of Germany. So the world goes to Munich to get the best systems and it fits well within AMETEK's family of businesses.
Christopher Glynn: Great, thanks. And just kind of a churning part of the cycle to a degree here. Several years ago, you went through some divestitures. As you look at things play out now, realizing you've really shrunk oil and metals for instance. Are there any areas of the portfolio that are bubbling up for potential divestiture?
Dave Zapico: Yes, we go through that strategic analysis every year and we went through it this year and there's nothing that's going to impact our guide. There's nothing large or substantial. There may be some smaller plans or things that we continue to act on during the course of the year, but these will be inconsequential and we like the portfolio that we have right now.
Christopher Glynn: Great. Thanks a lot.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Lots of information so far, but I'm sorry if I missed this David. What is the organic I think low single digit for the full year, but what is the how does that break out between EMG and EIG? And I'm just curious if you're seeing a stronger rebound in EMG just given that Paragon and Automation were quite badly impacted by destocking. So I'm just wondering if you're factoring in a stronger rebound in those two businesses.
Dave Zapico: EMG is going to have slightly higher organic growth than EIG, so it's going to be a bit higher. It's going to be low single digit for the year and but EMG is going to be a bit higher.
Nigel Coe: A little bit higher. Okay. That's great. And then just the EMG margins in fourth quarter, I mean, obviously, EIG was spectacular, but EMG came in a bit lighter. And I know that there's typically some production disabsorption in the fourth quarter. Just wondering, was there any intentional like extended production shortfalls in the fourth quarter?
Dave Zapico: No, it's the calendar effect and we're going through a destocking there and our automation business is extremely profitable and it's down substantially with it. So we had core margins down over 100 basis points in that part of the business. And the good thing is we've leaned out the cost structure and we're really at a good place to grow. So as destocking abates and that business has bottomed, we're looking forward to when that turns, it should be some profitable sales for us.
Nigel Coe: And then just a quick follow on to that comment about automation margins. Are you expecting automation to be back to positive organic growth in the first quarter next year or this year?
Dave Zapico: Yes, the automation business is lagging the medical business a bit. So we will have to see how that plays out.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys. Good morning. I'm not sure. Did you give the actual order number or the book to bill for the quarter? I if you did, I apologize.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Let me let me, grab that. The organic orders were 4%. The book-to-bill was 1.01 if we exclude FX on the backlog. And both I guess both grew for positive, EMG was a little bit more positive than EIG, but they were both strong.
Joe Giordano: And then can you walk us through just I think you mentioned in the outlook the view for Aerospace and Defense. So can you kind of do your walk with like the 2024 actual and like the View? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes. We forgot that we didn't get to that yet. So on the process side, the process declined low single digits in the fourth quarter. We saw strong growth in the quarter within our advanced optical metrology businesses as well as our high-end microscopy business had a good quarter. And similar to last year, we experienced some temporary delays -- similar to last quarter, we experienced some temporary delays in project spending. And then looking forward to 2025, we expect organic sales for our process businesses to be up low single digits for the full year. And then I talked about the Aerospace and Defense business already and there we expect ongoing strength in both Commercial and Defense and to be up mid-single digits for 2025. So process, low aerospace and defense, mid. Then you go to Power and Industrial, our sales were flat in the fourth quarter. Our RTDS business, which provides advanced power simulation systems to utilities and research institutions saw good growth in the quarter. For 2025, we expect organic sales for our Power and Industrial businesses to remain flat relative to 2024 levels. And finally, the Automation and Engineered Solutions business, overall sales were up low double digits, driven by the contributions from the Paragon acquisition. Organic sales were down high single digits in the quarter consistent with the levels we've seen during the year given the continued normalization of our OEM customer inventories. And for 2025, we expect organic sales to be up mid-single digits for the year with improving growth trends throughout the year.
Joe Giordano: Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Hi, good morning. This is Sahil Manocha on for Deane Dray. Can you provide any context on the $85 million in growth investments? How is that split between segment and is that adding mostly sales and engineering and what was the 2024 growth investment?
Dave Zapico: The 2024 was $90 million and the 2025 is $85 million, so they're very close. And again, that's the incremental spend and it's largely research, development and engineering spend. So I'd say 2/3 of the $85 million is RD&E and about 1/3 of it is additional marketing channel sales and marketing work. So about 2/3, 1/3 and it's biased toward EIG largely because of the size of EIG. So it's pretty it's across the whole company biased to EIG.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then, the vitality index reached 28% in the third quarter, I believe, which you noted was strong level within the target range of 20% to 30%. Could you discuss the new product intros that you're most excited about for 2025? And how do you see the vitality index trending?
Dave Zapico: Yes, we talk about a vitality index being between 20% to 30% is a good number and we didn't mention it, but actually it was extremely high in Q4 30%. So it was one of our highest numbers. So the new product engine is working and that's why we have such a strong pipeline of new orders and I think it's going to pay off next year. We think a number like 20% to 30% is a good number for us and we started tracking this, it was down in the low teens, mid-teens many years ago. So we think it's a good number now. It's a way that we can look at the investments we're putting in and making sure we're adding value to our customers. It shows up in pricing also, we can get premium prices by adding features to products and having providing new value to our customers that we weren't providing before. So it's a healthy amount, we spend a healthy amount of RD&E and given our niche market focus and technology leadership, innovation leadership that matches the strategy of the company.
Deane Dray: Awesome. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Mason with Baird.
Robert Mason: Yes. Good morning, Dave, Dalip. Dave, you had mentioned earlier that your Labs business, you were seeing strength more just call it rest of world versus the U.S. right now. Can you drill into that a little bit? Is that your own overlay or footprint where you're exposed or differences in government priorities or just what's maybe driving that difference?
Dave Zapico: It could be government priorities, it could be channel investments we made, but the place that we're seeing a lot of lab expansion work is in Asia. So Asia, the market is healthy everywhere, but Asia is particularly healthy.
Robert Mason: Maybe just to continue the thought there, relative to your 2025 guidance, could you provide kind of a geographic overlay to that, just how you're thinking about the regions for 2025?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I'll talk about 2024 -- where we ended up in 2024, we had essentially strong growth in Europe and Asia offset by some declines in the U.S. So if you look at the full year, we had about plus 2 internationally and down MSD in the U.S. And that was largely our automation business that was down in the U.S. So in places like in Asia, we were up and China was roughly flat. So that's kind of hanging in there for us. And when we think about 2025, we're looking for all regions to grow. We're thinking we actually see some strength in Europe. Like I said, we were plus 2% in Europe and some strength in Europe. We think some of the strength in Asia is going to continue, maybe more strength outside of China than in China. We have good channels there and we think the U.S. is going to return to growth for us. So it will be balanced growth across all geographies.
Robert Mason: When you said China was flat, was that a Q4 number or a full year?
Dave Zapico: I think it was a full year number.
Robert Mason: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hey, good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Can hear you fine.
Andrew Buscaglia: Yes, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning.
Andrew Buscaglia: Good. Yes, sorry about that earlier. I'm not sure what happened. So, yes, I wanted to touch on your orders. You're saying are up 4%, and you had some good commentary just about your subsegments for sales. But what about it sounds like orders are getting a little bit better, the momentum is picking up. What about order momentum in each subsegment? Where is that coming from?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think that what you really have is in the sub segments, the big thing in the Automation and Engineered Solutions, that was the destock abating and we're starting to see some of the customers place orders now specifically in the med tech area. So that's positive. And on the automation part of the business, we think it's bottomed and we've got a lean out cost structure. So we're optimistic about what that's going to do when it increases. The process and the power businesses, we think we're well positioned and those are the project businesses, we saw some delays, we're hoping that those are going to abate a bit and quoting a lot of activity, good pipelines there. And then in Aerospace and Defense, it's pretty much steady. We think both our military and our commercial aftermarket is going to do well, ongoing strength in both sides of it.
Andrew Buscaglia: Yes, okay. And yes, you are generating a ton of cash, great cash flow in the quarter. This year, are we going to see a series of sort of like current deals or you expect like another Paragon-ish size deal in 2025?
Dave Zapico: That's a great question. I mean, right now we have bigger deals in our pipeline and we also have smaller technology deals, what I put Kern in our pipeline. So, and we have we could probably spend $5 billion in 2025 on deals and we'd still only have a debt to EBITDA of about $2.5 billion the way we calculate it. So we're very aggressive in that area and there's properties, businesses that people were holding back on. It seems like the market is picking up a bit. So we think with our strong balance sheet, we're going to be able to get deals done, we're going to be able to be opportunistic with share buybacks and we're going to reward our shareholders -- long-term shareholders with an ever increasing dividend, small dividend, but ever increasing. So we have a balance sheet where we can do it all and we're going to do it all. But I think the most optimism is in the M&A area right now.
Andrew Buscaglia: Yes, okay. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I'll now hand the call back over to Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer, Kevin Coleman for any closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.
Operator: [Operator Closing Remarks].

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the AMETEK Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Kevin Coleman.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dalip Puri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2023 or 2024 results or to 2024 guidance will be on an adjusted basis excluding after tax acquisition-related intangible amortization and excluding a pretax of $29.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share charge in the first quarter of 2024 for integration costs related to the Paragon Medical acquisition. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. AMETEK delivered strong results in the third quarter. Our business has executed extremely well, resulted in earnings per share above our expectations, solid margin performance, outstanding cash flow conversion and double-digit growth in overall orders with positive growth in organic orders. Additionally, during the quarter, we deployed approximately $60 million on share repurchases. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired Virtek Vision, an excellent strategic fit with our Creaform business. I am very pleased with our team's performance. Our businesses remain focused on managing through short-term macro headwinds, while ensuring we are positioned for long-term growth. We have a proven successful growth model, and efficient operating structure, robust cash flows, a strong balance sheet and leading positions across a diverse set of niche markets. Now, let me turn to our third quarter financial results. Third quarter sales were $1.71 billion, up 5% from the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down 2%, acquisitions added 7.5 points and foreign currency was flat. Overall, orders in the quarter were up 12%. Book-to-bill was 1.02 and organic orders were up 2%. Additionally, we saw a solid sequential growth in orders. We ended the quarter with a strong backlog of $3.44 billion near record levels. AMETEK's operational performance in the third quarter was excellent. Our disciplined approach to cost management and operational efficiency resulted in strong margins. Operating income in the quarter was $446 million, a 2% increase over the third quarter of 2023 and operating margins were 26.1% in the quarter. Core margins, excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency were very strong at 27.4%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was $553 million, up 4% versus the prior year with EBITDA margins an impressive, 31.2%. Cash flow in the third quarter was excellent with free cash flow up 4% versus the prior year and free cash flow conversion of very strong 135%, reflecting our asset-light business model and operating capability. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.66 per diluted share, up 1% versus the third quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.60 to $1.62 per share. Now, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG continues to perform well with strong margin expansion and overall outstanding levels of operating margins reflecting the quality of our businesses. EIG sales were $1.13 billion in line with the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 2% and acquisitions contributed two points. Growth remains solid across our Aerospace & Defense businesses, while our high-end research instrumentation business CAMECA also saw strong growth in the quarter. While we did see some temporary delays in project spending across parts of our EIG business as we had expected our new funnel pipeline remains solid and our businesses are very well positioned across a number of secular growth markets. EIG operating income was $339 million, up 1% and operating margins were a very strong 29.9%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. EIG core margins were 30.2%, up 70 basis points versus last year's third quarter. Now switching to the Electromechanical Group. EMG's third quarter sales were $574 million, up 18% versus the prior year with organic sales down 3% and acquisitions contributing over 20 points to growth. Strong growth across our Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter was offset by expected weakness with our OEM-exposed businesses due to the impact of inventory destocking. EMG orders were very strong in the quarter growing 12% organically. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $132 million, up 3% compared to the prior year period, while EMG's third quarter operating margins were 22.9% with excellent core margins of 26.1%. AMETEK delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, effectively navigating demand headwinds to deliver strong results. We remain focused on executing our growth model and positioning AMETEK for continued long-term growth, while ensuring we deliver strong results in the face of a choppy macro environment. Now turning to our acquisition strategy. Strategic acquisitions are a core component of our growth model. We are committed to deploying our strong cash flow and acquisitions to expand our portfolio in highly attractive market segments. With that I'm excited to announce our newest acquisition Virtek Vision. Virtek Vision is a leading provider of laser-based projection and inspection systems, offering a suite of 2D and 3D laser projectors, smart cameras and advanced measurement solutions powered by their proprietary AI software. Virtek's automated systems enhance productivity, improve quality and reduce cost, across a range of aerospace defense and industrial applications. Virtek is an excellent strategic fit with our Creaform business, broadening its technology offerings and enabling a wider range of automation and inspection capabilities for our customers. Virtek is headquartered in Waterloo, Canada and has annual sales of approximately $40 million. I would like to welcome the Virtek team to the AMETEK family. Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust. As noted, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet and anticipate remaining active in this area. AMETEK also remains committed to investing in our businesses to ensure they are positioned for long-term sustainable growth. In 2024, we are investing an incremental $90 million in growth initiatives including our new product development efforts where our teams are focused on developing highly differentiated technologies to help solve our customers' most complex challenges. Throughout our business, we see countless examples of innovative products and technologies being developed to support our customers and provide them with the advanced differentiated capabilities to need. One way we measure the success of our new product development activities is through our Vitality Index, which measures the sales from products introduced over the past three years. In the third quarter, our Vitality Index was an outstanding 28%. In addition to our internal development activities, I'm also pleased to announce that our CAMECA business, a leader in micro-analytical and metrology instrumentation recently completed a small technology acquisition of Polygon Physics. Polygon Physics specializes in ultracompact, ultra-low power electron cyclotron resonance technology. This technology enhances CAMECA's capabilities and advanced metrology instrumentation and advanced chip manufacturing. Polygon provides us access to cutting-edge ion source technology and expertise that will help accelerate CAMECA's new product development efforts and enhance their technology portfolio. We're excited to welcome the Polygon team to AMETEK. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Given our third quarter results, we are raising our earnings guidance for the full year. We continue to expect overall sales to be up 5% to 7% versus the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.77 to $6.82, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $6.70 to $6.80 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits with earnings in the range of $1.81 to $1.86, up 8% to 11% versus the prior year. In summary, I'm pleased with the team's performance in the quarter and thus far in 2024. We're managing through an uncertain macro environment and confident in our ability to navigate these challenges. AMETEK has been very successful over a long period of time managing a diverse set of highly differentiated niche businesses. The AMETEK growth model has allowed us to deliver double-digit earnings growth throughout different phases of the economic cycle. The strength of our portfolio combined with our operational excellence capabilities and acquisition strategy has allowed us to deliver outstanding results. This has also allowed us to successfully manage through periods of economic weakness or uncertainty and emerge even stronger with exceptional growth. We are excited for the future. I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri who will take us through some of the financial details of the quarter. And then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip?
Dalip Puri: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered strong results in the third quarter with excellent operating performance and high free cash flow conversion. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $25 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year. As a percentage of sales, G&A expense came in at 1.4% of sales down from 1.5% in last year's third quarter. For fiscal year 2024 general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales. Third quarter interest expense was $25 million up $7 million from the third quarter of 2023, due to higher debt balances following recent acquisitions. Third quarter other operating expenses were down $4 million versus the prior period due largely to higher pension income and lower acquisition-related due diligence expense in the quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% up from 17.7% in the third quarter of 2023. For 2024, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 17% and 17.5% driven by a lower fourth quarter tax rate due to statute expirations. As we have stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from the full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $90 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $395 million, including after tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $188 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the third quarter was 19% of sales. Cash flow generation in the third quarter was excellent. Operating cash flow was $487 million, up 3% versus the third quarter of 2023, while free cash flow was $461 million, up 4% over the prior year. This was a record third quarter level for both operating and free cash flow generation. Free cash flow conversion was also outstanding at 135% in the quarter. For the full year, we now expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% to 120% of net income. During the quarter, we spent $60 million on share repurchases, repurchasing approximately 371,000 shares of our common stock in the open market. Additionally at the end of the quarter, we paid down a maturing $300 million private placement note. Total debt at September 30th was $2.34 billion, down $360 million in the quarter and down approximately $1 billion from the end of 2023. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $396 million. At the end of the third quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times. We have significant financial capacity and flexibility with over $2 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our acquisition strategy and growth initiatives. In summary, AMETEK delivered strong results in the third quarter. Our operational excellence initiatives and our strategic focus contributed to strong earnings, robust margins and excellent free cash flow. With a strong balance sheet, near-record backlog and leadership across our key markets, we are well-positioned for continued long-term growth. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Dalip. Andrew, could we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.
Matt Summerville: Good morning guys.
Dave Zapico: Morning, Matt.
Matt Summerville: David, could you maybe do a little bit more of a detailed update specifically on what you're seeing in your medical and life sciences facing end markets across both EIG and EMG and work in some commentary on what you're seeing in those businesses specifically around destocking? And then I have a follow-up.
Dave Zapico: Yeah, sure. We saw -- in terms of the destock, we saw demand largely in line with our expectations in the quarter. Actually as both our OEM customers and our automation and Paragon businesses continue to work down excess levels of inventory. And the destocking headwinds are going to continue. We remain well-positioned on a range of attractive programs within both the automation business and the Paragon business. And we're really encouraged by the trend in recent order rates. We had the -- in EMG where the main destocking areas was up plus 12 organically. Again we had a positive book-to-bill of 1.02. And if you just look at the trends, the trends are heading in the right direction. So we stabilized we saw solid sequential growth in orders and we're feeling pretty good about that.
Matt Summerville: And then as a follow-up you mentioned in your prepared remarks when talking about EIG that you're still seeing a little bit of customer tentativeness with respect to some delays in that portion of the business. Can you just talk through maybe, which divisions are being most impacted by that, which end markets, et cetera? And if you're able at all to kind of ring fence and quantify the impact?
Dave Zapico: Sure. Yeah, I'll do that Matt. In terms of the project lease we spoke about last quarter this quarter played out largely as expected. Customers remain cautious given the impact of various economic, geopolitical and election uncertainties. And these project delays are specifically in our EIG test and measurement businesses. That's what we talked about last quarter. And the key point here is our new opportunity funnel remains strong. So things are definitely not getting worse. In fact, the EIG orders trend went from minus 11 organic in Q1 to minus four organic in Q2 to minus two organic in Q3. So we're feeling pretty good about the -- encouraged by the positive trend there.
Matt Summerville: Got it. Thanks David.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Matt.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Dave maybe you can take us through the end markets geographies? And to the extent that you can some comments on China, I don't think there's ever been more mixed messages, most of them negative, but each company has got different views based upon their exposures, but maybe we can start there. Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Great set of questions. I'll try to get them all, and if I forget anything, pull me back to it. I'll go around the one first, and talk about our process business. Both, overall and organic sales for our process businesses, declined low single digits in the quarter. Growth, remains solid across our energy businesses. We had a good quarter in energy. And also our high-end research business, we talked about CAMECA also had a very strong growth in the quarter. And looking ahead, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be flat to up low single digits for the full year. Next switching the Aerospace & Defense. Aerospace & Defense is about 18% of AMETEK, delivered strong performance in the quarter, both overall and organic sales were up mid-single digits. Growth was strongest across our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses. A reminder, we have a good balance between sales and defense and we have a good balance between OEM products and aftermarket. And additionally, we're on a wide range of applications and not dependent on any one platform. So, we're positioned well to benefit from the long-term growth across these markets. And for the full year, we continue to expect high single-digit organic growth for our aerospace and defense businesses. Next, I'll go to power and industrial. Power and industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter driven by the contributions of Amplifier Research and UEI, recent acquisitions both of them. Organic sales were down low single digits in the quarter. We expect organic sales for our power and industrial businesses to be down low single digits for the full year. Then, finally our Automation & Engineered Solutions market segment. Overall, sales there increased in the low 20% range, driven primarily by the contributions of Paragon Medical. Organic sales were down, high single digits due to continued normalization of inventory across our OEM customer base. And for the full year, we continue to expect organic sales to decline mid-single digits as the headwinds from destocking continue. Talking about the geographies, yes, a little different in the mix there. We had strong growth in Europe and Asia, offset by some declines in the US. You talked specifically about China. Our Asia business did well, and China was actually up 10%. We had strong growth in our UPT or Ultra Precision Technology division, AMETEK products are used by our customers in China to improve their manufacturing processes, automate processes, make the environment cleaner, produce energy. So, very well positioned. But that market will remain choppy and there's been some stimulus announced, but the results that we're seeing now aren't from stimulus or just from market share wins and making good headway in the markets. But it's very difficult to predict, what's happening in China. So it's just wait and see what happens each quarter.
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. And it is remarkable, how -- it really depends on what your exposures are in China. You just can't paint it all, with the negative brush there. And just as a quick follow-up, the context of destocking the longer it lasts, I always get this impression that it's really a lower demand as opposed to just an inventory correction. So, what's your sense? Is there a reset, let's say, at Paragon? Or is it still you can see sell-in versus sell-through and that there is really like an inventory work down coming through? Just kind of, how do you separate those two dynamics?
Dave Zapico: Yes. That's a great question, and it's obviously difficult to parse, but we're pretty confident that we're working through a supply chain crisis level of inventory that -- and we have some math you can see, when we work through that and then there's the same kind of growth on the other end of it. And same thing is happening in the medical space as the automation space. So, we're seeing -- the other factor that influences our decision, is the new business activity the pipeline activity. Our customers are very active. We're working on new programs and they're getting delayed but there's no program cancellations and there's some uncertainty when they're going to go forward, but we're full out working on tremendous number of opportunities. So, we think it's a destocking issue and it's not an overall demand issue and we think we'll work through it. And you can see some of that starting to happen with the order trends in our business.
Deane Dray: Excellent. I'll leave it there. Just a quick shout out. That was a nice free cash flow this quarter. thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Deane. The team did a great job.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague: Hey thanks. Good morning everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning Jeff.
Jeff Sprague: Hey good morning. Hey David I was on a little late, so I don't know if you just listening to your answer to Deane, I don't know if you already specifically commented on Paragon. But just in terms of the sales trajectory there if you wouldn't mind repeating it. And then just on EMG overall right? It's certainly kind of an interesting set of cross currents right with destock going on but orders up 12% organically? Maybe you could just unpack a little bit more kind of the moving pieces inside that if you haven't already.
Dave Zapico: Yes, I haven't gone deeper, but I can say that every division at EMG was up substantially in orders. So, it wasn't one area. So it was across the board all parts of EMG are up in order. So, we're really encouraged by that. Speaking of Paragon, again, it's a single-use and consumable surgical instruments business implantable components in attractive med tech markets with solid growth rates. And we continue to be excited about the future growth opportunities, excellent engineering capability, leading additive manufacturing capability. Many, many new program wins which will provide upside as these things get phased in. And the business is really well-positioned when the destocking headwinds abate. At the same time we're working on substantial efficiency improvements in the business. And the team is really doing an excellent job of doing that because of some difficult things that are going on. And -- but that process is proceeding well. So, I'm very pleased. I mean Paragon met its expectations for Q3. They had a similar sequential order improvement that we talked about in our other businesses and overall very pleased with it.
Jeff Sprague: Dave then on sort of the margin recovery plan itself obviously the restructuring in Q1 and I guess if there's a silver lining in the drawdown right maybe it allows you to accelerate some things on restructuring and the like. Can you give us a sense of sort of the likely tailwind into 2025 as we work through some of these things and arguably sales start to kind of stabilize pick back up into the new year?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think the scenario you're talking about is something that has a high likelihood of happening. But when you talk about 2025, we don't give guidance at this time of the year. So, we're going to stay away from that and talking about next year. But the things that you're pointing to are correct. I mean it's a tough time. We're improving the business significantly. There are some plant closures in there and we're continuing to fund all the new product phases in. So, it's going to be a very, very positive scenario as we move forward with that business.
Jeff Sprague: Great. Thank you for in the insights. Appreciate it.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Hey, I had a couple of cleanups. Just to kind of put a bow on the destocking. I mean you guys were clear that destocking should continue through the end of the year. I think you mentioned that it continues again now Dave. The orders seem to indicate that we're getting there. I don't know whether your comment was implied was intended to imply any continuation in the next year?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think we've definitely stabilized in the last couple of orders we're seeing quarters we're seeing incremental orders growth. We're encouraged by that. We're seeing it in EMG where the destocking was occurring. We're seeing it in all of our businesses. So, that's all positive. But this destock isn't like a switch. There's going to be -- we're going to slowly improve. As we get into next year, we'll give you the guidance for next year. But whether the destock occurs or not, we're going to make money. And that's what we're working on the operations side. So my point is there's positive trends now. We haven't given guidance for next year. We go through our standard process with sitting down with each business and go through a comprehensive budgeting process. We look at market conditions and sales opportunities and cost reduction opportunities and decide what investments to fund. And it's very important to follow this process right now given all the macro geopolitical and election uncertainty, because -- that's why we're firm on doing -- working through our process and giving you a good look at the best information we have at the beginning of next year.
Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you. And then if I may on the acquisition pipeline, your balance sheet looks great. Obviously, the pipeline is robust. Are you seeing any similar hesitation to commit amongst your potential inquiries is slowing things down? Or should we just assume things come on stock as normal process? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes, that's a good question. Excellent question, Rob. And this is just my subjective read on the market, but I feel like things are coming on stock. We were in a period where things were -- everybody was dealing with higher interest rates and trying to get their businesses in order. But our pipeline is robust and we're talking to a lot of people about a lot of things. So I feel like sometime next year -- sometime early next year. It feels like things are moving and it feels like they're moving at an accelerated pace.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners.
Scott Graham: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Really just a couple of them. You're doing a lot of investing internally. The Vitality is up to 28%. Dave you mentioned that you're really heavily focused on some differentiated products. Could you maybe unbundle that a little bit more? And I know Vitality the percentage is always a tricky thing, because it's a three-year trail. But nevertheless is that a number that you think can go even higher? And maybe which businesses -- I know that you're single titers. I get all that. But is there anything that's standing out to you in certain business units? And where can that index go?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think -- we think the right level for our business is between 20% and 30%. And we're at 28% and it could go down to 20% or go up to 30% and that's probably the right range. As you mentioned, it's very distributed across our company. We're spending incrementally $90 million on projects. They're good projects. They're going to result in good sales in the future. In some cases they're coming in at lower price points too. There's been a good job of cost reductions through the new development processes. So, it's -- and when you have the fresh up-to-date product line and you're a leader in the niche markets that we're in it enables you to justify premium pricing for the new products. So, that all feels good. It all feels -- it's working well and it's part of our core. So, we've -- as you know you've followed us for a long time whether the market is good or the market is bad, we fund the R&D spending consistently and it's paid off for us in the long run and we plan to continue it.
Scott Graham: Thank you. I just wanted to ask something that's a little bit more forward-looking to the extent that you can answer it. One of your two very large aerospace customers is struggling in various parts of their portfolio in production. I'm just wondering does that dampen your potential outlook for 2025 in your Aerospace business.
Dave Zapico: Yes. We haven't done the detailed work on 2025. And related to the situation, we did see some minor delays in the quarter but we were able to work around them. And we factored in the impact that we know of for Q4, and it's a fluid situation obviously but we feel confident in our guide for Q4. Our Aerospace businesses have diverse exposures across a wide range of platforms a very healthy mix of OEM and aftermarket sales. There's no overexposure to any single platform or any single customer. So we're feeling good about that. And there's a strong demand and we're well positioned to benefit from it. And we're not selling as much up on the value chain. We focus on what we do well, the technologies in the niche markets that we focus on. And we really feel that, we're in a good position going forward. And hopefully, some of the larger customers can work through some of the situations that we're in, but we think we have a call properly for the rest of this year.
Scott Graham: Great. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho.
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning, all.
Dave Zapico: Hello, Brett.
Brett Linzey: Hey. Just wanted to come back to the OEM dynamic and the destock once more. So you noted some of the internal exercises or the math the teams were doing to gauge that pressure. I guess, is there any way to quantify in revenue dollars or order percent? How much of the pressure on results this year has been related to OEM destock?
Dave Zapico: I'd say that -- yes, if you go back to Q2, we talked about it, it's pretty significant. It's significant. So if that reverses, that's clearly not -- it's a headwind that's not there for next year. So yeah, it was -- in our automation business and with Paragon, that de-stock was substantial.
Brett Linzey: Okay. Got it. And then just on the project delays. So I think you noted it was various verticals. I guess what are you hearing from customers in terms of project readiness and when these might return? Are you contemplating any catch-up in the fourth quarter as part of the guide? Or have you slid that expectation to 2025?
Dave Zapico: I think our Q4 guide for our project businesses and EIG assumes a normal calendar Q4 that's pretty strong. So we'll see a sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 related to seasonality, related to projects in that business. So it feels like there's definitely some year-end spending going on. So that's positive.
Brett Linzey: Okay. Great. Best of luck.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to come back to orders. Plus 2% organic, I think, is what you said. So that's great news. I don't think you were signaling the return to growth until the fourth quarter, if I'm not mistaken. So just anything happened during September that changed that? Any call out? Was there some aerospace -- just any color there? And then maybe on sort of the back end of that, if we kind of like look at the implied organic orders, it seems like there's about $140 million or thereabout $140 million, $150 million of backlog growth that's not organic that's a big number. So I'm just wondering, what the book-to-bill was for Paragon? And whether this Virtek acquisition has influence as well?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. The first point is we don't give guidance on orders. So I don't know how you got your information on the Q3 being a quarter late. But in any event, it's what it was. The second point was -- A - Kevin Coleman Backlog build.
Dave Zapico: The backlog build, yeah, we don't have that number in front of us. It's something we look at. It was $3.44 billion for the company and pretty healthy. And it's -- and the orders turn positive. So I think it's -- I wouldn't read too much into it. It's just positive. We're just encouraged by the positive trends and maybe it did occur earlier than you thought it would be. And we think we're going to have a good quarter in Q4.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Okay. Maybe I'm just mistaken there. And then looking at Paragon, obviously, I think you asked about the -- seen in sales this year is really inventory draw. Should we consider that to be sort of one-time in nature and therefore, we spring back to original plan in 2025? Or do you think it might take a little bit longer to achieve that?
Dave Zapico: So Nigel, your question broke up on our end, and we couldn't hear you. But we...
Nigel Coe: Okay. Paragon the inventory impact has reversed basically in 2025?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I mean as that inventory situation abates it's definitely going to improve in 2025. And hopefully it improves in 2025 and we have a low cost -- lower cost structure and we also have a lot of new products that we're phasing in. It's going to take some time like I said you don't throw a switch. But yes I really think it is going to improve in 2025.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. A lot of time spent on the EMG orders. And Dave you gave the kind of sequential improvement in the year-over-year for EIG. But wondering if we could go a little further into the sequential 3Q over 2Q orders pattern for EIG maybe anything on book-to-bill there?
Dave Zapico: Yes. The book-to-bill for the whole company was 1.02 and it was above one for both of the groups. That's what I can give you there.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. That covers all that. And then last quarter you talked about defense delays and you had a couple of mid single-digit quarters for A&D versus the high single-digit guide. Is -- what's the status update on the defense? And is that something that you have factored in pretty strong in the fourth quarter?
Dave Zapico: Yes. Yes we had -- Q2 and Q3 there's a little bit of project timing on that and we think that's going to reverse and there's some good things scheduled for us in Q4. That business is excellent because it's growing. The defense business is growing, but it is project based. So it can be lumpy but -- it's lumpy and headed in the right direction. So you're looking at it the right way.
Christopher Glynn: Great. Thanks. Lastly, I'm not sure if it was asked multiple companies coming through here. But the deal pipeline just curious mix of small larger actionability?
Dave Zapico: Yes. The deal pipeline remains strong. We're actively looking at a high number of quality deals. We obviously have got the cash and the credit facilities to execute. That's recognized by sellers. The pipeline is a variety of deal sizes and we're very active. And what I mentioned before it feels like things are starting to move a little bit more in that area than they were maybe in the last six or nine months.
Christopher Glynn: Great. Thanks a lot.
Dave Zapico: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Good morning. Can you hear me?
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew. Yes.
Andrew Obin: Hi. How are you? Look I appreciate Dave that you don't give guide on orders. But just checking if my math is correct. If I do look on a two-year stack just third quarter of last year organically was the easiest comp in the year. And I think sort of right it was minus 10 and it just goes to minus two by Q4. And if I look at Q2 and Q3 on a two-year stack, for orders, I'm just wondering, is it reasonable to assume that we've bottomed and by fourth quarter, we could return to growth is just arithmetically, it would suggest that we'll probably continue to be -- we'll go back to order decline. And I know you don't guide it, but we're just getting a lot of questions from investors, when do orders impact for these short-cycle names? And look, I get it, it's macro. You don't have a specialty crystal ball. I appreciate all these things.
Dave Zapico : Yes, that's right. Our crystal ball is no better than anyone else's. But we don't look at the two-year stack numbers, so I can't comment on your numbers. What I can comment is that there's been healthy sequential increases from Q2 to Q3. So and we also saw a sequential increase from Q1 to Q2. So, along with the two-year stack on the year-over-year and we gave the organic numbers already, the sequential numbers are -- they were up mid single digits in the quarter. So that's an encouraging fact from our viewpoint.
Andrew Obin: No. Really appreciate it, more than I expected. And just a follow-up question on Paragon and it's a different business. I mean, it's med tech, right? So a lot more regulation. Could you just give us an update on the time line of your restructuring? And obviously, AMETEK playbook is as good as anyone's in the industrial world. But how do you apply this playbook on timing of the restructuring and getting things out fast in terms of costs in a regulated environment where you can't just move production from one facility to another. You can't. It's all subject to regulatory approval. Can you just -- what lessons are being learned? And what has the speed of restructuring been relative to -- I'm sure, very high expectations? Thank you.
Dave Zapico : Yes, because the environment is regulated, and we know that because we have another business in the space that we moved factories. So our EMC business is a sister business to Paragon. So we're very experienced with the regulatory environment and our timing is adjusted for it, and you have to move slow and you have to be careful when it takes a bit longer, just like moving an aerospace business, or just like moving a defense business, or just like moving a utility business. So we operate in a lot of regulated markets. That's really our focus. We like regulated markets. This isn't new for us. It's kind of core. If you look at our whole portfolio. And -- but you're right, it does take time, and we're going to do it right.
Andrew Obin: So on time. Really appreciate it.
Dave Zapico : Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.
Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Good morning.
Dave Zapico : Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano : Just curious on the aero, you mentioned like you're taking everything into consideration. I know you're a very balanced there, but is your Boeing OE exposure like are you essentially assuming zero in the fourth quarter? Or are you still selling to like maybe Tier 1s or something where you can still ship?
Dave Zapico : Yes, I think you've got it right. I mean, the -- where we have confirmed orders to lower levels of the supply chain is zero. And if there was anything direct, that's removed.
Joe Giordano : Got it. And then apologies if I missed this, I had joined a little bit late. But on Paragon, did you give an updated 2024 like revenue number that you expect from them or a contribution number?
Dave Zapico : No, we didn't give the number. And the number that we gave last quarter still holds, and Paragon executed in line with what they thought they did for this quarter. It was a good quarter for them. We also talked about the sequential orders growing in Paragon too.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.
Jeff Sprague: Hey. Thanks for let me back. And just a really quick follow-up, Dave can you just give us an update on price and then what you're seeing on kind of price cost spread in the quarter? And do you think that changing any -- as we move into Q4 the early part of 2025?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. That's a good question, Jeff. I mean price -- it seems we're getting back to more normal patterns. In the quarter we got three points of price pretty consistent across the portfolio and we got about 100 basis points of positive spread to the P&L from it. So I think the days of the high inflation the higher price are abating. And I think we're in the normal -- if you look into the next year normal price/cost spread where we are always positive by 50 basis points and the number is like 2% to 3%.
Jeff Sprague: Right. Thanks again.
Dave Zapico: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KBCM.
Dave Zapico: Hi Steve.
Steve Barger: Hey. Thanks. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning.
Steve Barger: I'll just ask a question on the semi-cap cycle. It feels like expectations are moderating a bit due to slower recovery in some consumer products, but I know there's still a lot of optimism around leading-edge investments coming through. I think you're in deep back to detection and more leading edge. But based on how your portfolio is positioned can you match or outgrow whatever the equipment market does, as the cycle improves?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think we can. I mean, in the -- for example in the quarter, our semiconductor businesses were up mid-single digits and that was -- we had growth and it was driven by the uniqueness of the product portfolio. And the one thing about our portfolio is that we have a lot of laboratory semiconductor stuff that gets worked on during the -- between the cycles and then the production stuff that happens. So there's a natural balance in there. And we usually don't have large swings either way that kind of compensate or they're not correlated with each other. So it's a positive market. I mean you have some dynamics with China. We have some dynamics with new technology. We have a product in our CAMECA business that's been developed is very unique and best-in-class that's we're selling quite well now. So yeah, we were up mid-single digits. We think we'll be up mid-single digits for the year in semiconductor. That's about 6% of our portfolio. And we haven't done the planning for 2025. But if anything or -- that's a market that buys technology and our technology is getting better.
Steve Barger: That's great.
Dave Zapico: In fact, a small acquisition that we did Polygon Physics was related to an ion source technology that is specifically used in EUV manufacturing and gives us some capability in the advanced semiconductor space.
Steve Barger: Understood. And so does it feel like the cycle itself -- and I know you do have some lab exposure but for the more high-volume production cycle does it feel like we're inflecting?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I mean you read all the industry things out there, and it feels like there's some inflection points, but then you got some geopolitical dynamics and …
Steve Barger: Yeah.
Dave Zapico: …kind of sit back and see what happens on that one.
Steve Barger: Got it. Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Thank you Steve.
Operator: Thank you. I'll now hand the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer Kevin Coleman, for any closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder a replay of the webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This does conclude today's program. And you may now disconnect.

Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered solid results with a strong operating performance in the second quarter against the backdrop of a more subdued global growth environment. In the quarter, we experienced continued headwinds from inventory destocking across our OEM customer base, leading to lower-than-expected sales volumes. Additionally, we are seeing signs of customers turning more cautious leading to some temporary delays in project spending. Despite these headwinds, our businesses delivered strong operating performance in the quarter, we saw the growth in cash flow and earnings and robust core margin expansion reflecting the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK operating model. We expect the inventory destocking and more cautious customer behavior to continue in the back half of the year. As a result, we are adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate these near-term headwinds. As we've done in the past, we will expand our focus on operational efficiencies and continue to invest back in our businesses utilize our strong balance sheet to deploy capital on strategic acquisitions and ensure we position AMETEK for continued long-term growth. Now let me turn to our second quarter financial results. Sales in the quarter - sales in the second quarter were $1.73 billion, up 5% from the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down 2%. Acquisitions added 8 points in the quarter and foreign currency was a slight headwind. AMETEK's operational performance in the quarter was excellent with robust margin expansion. Operating income in the quarter was a record $448 million, 7% increase over the second quarter of 2023. Operating margins were 25.8% in the quarter, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, core margins were up a sizable 180 basis points in the quarter. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $545 million, up 10% over prior year with EBITDA margins in impressive 31.4%. Cash flow in the quarter was excellent, reflecting our operating capability and asset-light business model. Operating cash flow in the quarter was up 14% to $381 million with free cash flow up 17% and free cash flow conversion of 107%. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.66 per diluted share, up 6% versus the second quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.63 to $1.65 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG delivered strong operating performance with outstanding margin expansion. EIG sales were $1.15 billion, a 2% increase from the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were flat and acquisitions contributed two points. Growth was strongest within our aerospace and defense and CAMECA businesses in the quarter. EIG operating income was $350 million, up 14% versus the prior year and operating margins were at 30.3%, up 320 basis points from the prior year. Our EIG businesses are operating at a very high level with excellent operating margins. They remain well-positioned to benefit from a number of important long-term secular growth drivers, given their increasing exposures to attractive markets across process, aerospace, power and energy markets. The electric mechanical group continues to navigate the impacts of inventory normalization across our automation and engineered solutions businesses. In the quarter, EMG sales were a record $81 million, a 14% increase compared to the prior year, driven by contributions from the acquisition of Paragon Medical. Organic sales declined 6% due to weakness in our automation and engineered solutions businesses, more than offsetting solid growth across our EMG, aerospace and defense businesses. Acquisitions contributed 20% in the quarter. Operating income for the second quarter was $123 million with operating margins at 21.2%, while core operating income margins were 25%. As we have noted for a number of quarters, OEM customers across a wide range of markets are reducing excess inventory built up during the supply chain prices. While we had expected to see conditions approved in the second half of year, we now believe demand within this OEM customer base will remain subdued at current levels through the end of 2024. This inventory normalization is also impacting our medical OEM businesses, including Paragon Medical, leading to near-term delays in orders and shipments. Paragon remains very well-positioned for strong growth once the inventory correction is complete, given their leadership position across a number of high-growth MedTech market segments. Additionally, Paragon has won a new programs that we're currently investing in, which will drive incremental growth in 2025 and beyond. As we noted last quarter, are leveraging our proven integration capabilities to drive meaningful operational improvements to best position Paragon for long-term success. As the volumes return following destocking, we believe the business will be levered to deliver outstanding sales growth and profitability. In summary, we are operating our businesses very well with 7% growth in operating income and 180 basis points of core margin expansion in the quarter. We continue to generate strong cash flow with 17% free cash flow growth in the quarter. And for full year, we expect free cash flow to net income conversion be between 110% and 120%. The strength of AMETEK's operational excellence strategy is evident in our operating results. We continue to drive efficiency improvements across our businesses by leveraging our global infrastructure and OpEx initiatives. And this year, we now expect to generate $140 million in savings. We also remain committed to investing back into our businesses. And this year, we expect to invest an incremental $90 million in growth, largely focused on research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. The effectiveness of these investments is reflected in our vitality index, which was a strong 24% in the quarter. Additionally, our strong free cash flow and flexible balance sheet provides us with ample financial capacity for strategic acquisitions. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities remain strong. AMETEK is very well positioned to continue to expand our portfolio of highly differentiated businesses that both our organic growth investments and our acquisition strategy. Now, turning to outlook for the remainder of the year. With destocking expected to continue through the balance of the year and some customers turning more cautious on project spending, we are adjusting our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. Overall, sales are now expected to be up 5% to 7% versus the prior year, with organic sales expected to be flat to down low single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.80, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. This is less than a 1% reduction from our prior earnings guidance range of $6.74 to $6.86 as our proactive productivity actions, along with a lower expected fourth quarter tax rate helped offset the impact of the reduced sales forecast. This guidance reflects second half sales and operating earnings, essentially in line with our first half results. For the third quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.62 per share, down 1% to 2% versus the prior year. In summary, we are pleased with our business's strong operating performance in the second quarter. We have a proven operating model and an experienced management team, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the sluggish demand environment and deliver exceptional long-term results. I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Dal?
Dalip Puri: Thank, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK had a solid second quarter with excellent operating performance leading to outstanding margin expansion and strong cash flows. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $25 million or 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's second quarter. For fiscal year 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales. Second quarter interest expense was $31 million, up $12 million from the second quarter of 2023 due to higher debt balances following the acquisition of Paragon Medical in December. Second quarter other expense was down approximately $4 million versus the prior period, due largely to higher pension income and higher investment income in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 19%, up from 18.2% in the second quarter of 2023. For 2024, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 17% and 18%, driven by a lower fourth quarter tax rate due to statute expirations. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from the full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $21 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $99 million. In 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million. This includes after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the second quarter was 18.6% of sales. Operating cash flow was $381 million, up 14% versus the second quarter of 2023. While free cash flow was $360 million, up 17% over the prior year. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion was a strong 107% of net income. For the full year, we continue to expect strong free cash flow conversion in the range of 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at June 30 was $2.65 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the end of 2023. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $397 million. At the end of second quarter, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA was 1 times. We have significant financial capacity and flexibility with $2.2 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and deploy on strategic acquisitions. In summary, AMETEK had a solid second quarter of 2024, delivering strong results with robust margin expansion and excellent free cash flows. Our leading positions across attractive market segments Combined with our strong balance sheet and outstanding operating capabilities leaves us very well positioned to navigate the current environment and to deliver on our growth strategies. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Dalip. Can we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, Dave, you seemed pretty convinced a quarter ago that the destocking phenomenon would wrap itself up by mid-year. So I guess relative to 90 days ago, can you maybe talk a little bit about what's changed? What gives you confidence that we're only in for another six months of this? And then maybe touch on what end markets and businesses are starting to be impacted by some of the project delays you referenced? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes. Our outlook for the year has changed. And as we noted in my prepared remarks, we now expect the improvements in the second half of the year are not going to happen as originally anticipated, and we talked about that earlier in the year. We now expect our sales and operating performance in the second half will be similar to the growth that we – sales and operating performance in the first half. So we're not going to see the increases that we had anticipated. And this change results in about a four-point reduction in our sales outlook. And to your question, where is it coming from? Roughly three points of this reduction is our automation and engineered solutions subset, which is the businesses that we talked about being exposed to the OEM destocking. And within that area, we have two points of reduction tied to our automation business and one point from the Paragon destock. So that makes up about three to four-point reduction in our outlook. Across our EIG businesses, we expect about one point of lower sales due to short-term project delays. And there, we're seeing customers are being just a bit more cautious given the cumulative impact of wide range of economic, political and geopolitical factors. But we feel these are temporary delays. Our new funnel pipelines remain very solid, projects are not being canceled. They're being delayed. And given the expected lower sales, we reduced our earnings guidance by about $0.05 at the midpoint. Another couple of points. I mean, we've really done a good job running the company. It reflects when you take that sales decrease, it reflects about a 20% decremental margin on the expected lower sales. And as Dalip mentioned, the tax rate will be lower in Q4. So I'm pleased with how the team is managing through these temporary demand changes. I'm confident that we're positioned to see accelerated profit growth when the economic conditions change. I think to your point, we missed the timing of the recovery and the inventory corrections will take a bit longer. And as AMETEK does, we're adapting to the current situation, and we're going to manage our business appropriately. And as I said, we've got really pleased how the team responded with 20% decremental to the volume change.
Matt Summerville: Thanks, David. I would definitely agree on the decremental comment. Can you also - I think it's probably good from a timing standpoint in the call. Can you kind of go ahead and do the - around the horn you typically do across the businesses and how expectations have kind of changed in some of the suburbs?
Dave Zapico: Sure, Matt. I'll start with our largest subsegment, the process. Sales for our Process businesses were up low single digits with solid growth across our energy businesses and our CAMECA business in the quarter. As noted in my prepared remarks, we've seen customers, as we just talked about, turn more cautious. We expect this to continue in the second half as we discussed, and we expect our process businesses to be flat to up low single digits versus the prior year. Now I'll move to aerospace and defense and that business was up mid-single digits in the quarter. Growth was strongest across our commercial aerospace businesses, while Defense experienced some shipment delays in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect strong high single-digit organic sales growth for our A&D business with similar growth across both our commercial and defense businesses. Next, I'll move to our Power & Industrial businesses. And overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the second quarter with contributions from recent acquisitions being offset by a low single-digit decrease in organic sales. Similar to our process businesses, our Power and Industrial are seeing the same kind of customers of delaying some projects due to the broader macro uncertainties. And for all of '24, we now expect organic sales for our Process and Industrial businesses to be flat compared to 2023. And our final segment, automation and Engineered Solutions. Self-segment sales, they were up high teens on a percentage basis in the quarter. This was driven by the contributions from the acquisition of Paragon Medical. Organic sales in quarter were down approximately 10% due to the continued normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base, we expected to see improvements in return to growth, as we talked about in the second half of the year. And as we just mentioned, that's not going to happen. Inventory normalization is going to continue through the end of the year. And as a result, we expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be down mid-single digits for the full year. So that's a picture around the word at.
Matt Summerville: Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Dave, would like to pick up where you left off with Matt. And just some more color on the customers' kind of sentiment here and the delayed project spending. What kind of reasons are they giving you? Is it macro? Are they having trouble getting financing? Is it election worries? Any kind of way that you could characterize and frame for us about this degree of cautiousness?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think the - I think what we see from our customer base is they're just taking longer to approve projects. And they're going further up the sign-off chain, to get signed off. These are typically - they're not even large projects. And you see those resulting in delays. I think it's a combination of the elections in the U.S., I think two-thirds of the worlds have elections this year. So it's elections around the world. It's the - some financing related to the higher interest rate higher inflation. I mean, it's the worst. So just a lot of things that they're combining to affect people's decisions, and they're just delaying a bit, I mean the thing that's different than some other downturns is we still have very strong pipelines of new activity. So thinking about past downturns, we've been through a bunch of these, I don't think there's been any where we have a strong new activity pipeline from our customers. So the projects aren't being canceled. There may be some delays in phasing some new products in and maybe it's taken longer to get the financing, although that's not primary feedback we're getting. But I think it's this broader macro issue that's honestly a bit of smaller issue for us. The bigger issue is the OEM destock. So I think we had the pandemic. And then we had the supply chain crisis. And we're selling it in our automation and engineered solutions businesses differentiated components and subsystems to people that are typically smaller dollar value amounts to the entire system. And when people bought inventory, because we're very specialized, and they wanted to keep shipping the products. And now we're just dealing with a destocking process that's just taking a little longer than we thought. And I think that.
Deane Dray: Yes, David, that's really helpful. I love the way you characterize it because in slowing, that's one of the first things you see customers do is they kind of delay the spending more approvals. And so that's pretty familiar. Do have any sense that it's snowballing from here? Does it get like as the quarter progressed did those type of behaviors increase? And any kind of monthly cadence would be helpful.
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think the monthly cadence in both sales and orders was our typical monthly cadence. So otherwise, we typically step through a quarter with the first month being the lowest and the second month being a little bit higher than the third month being the highest month of the quarter. That same process occurred. But definitely, as the quarter went on, we saw some incremental weakness mainly in the project area.
Deane Dray: Got it. All right. Just last question on the destocking and when we look back on this period, that's been the biggest surprise how long it has persisted. And you're not, by far, the only one. We've seen this everywhere. Anyone has anything to do with medical or life sciences supplies chain it has just taken more than 2x longer than anyone thought. And just the question is for Paragon. What's their visibility like? You said they - a percent of point was from their, destock…
Dave Zapico: Right.
Deane Dray: What's their visibility versus your comparison of the rest of AMETEK businesses, where do they fit on that scale?
Dave Zapico: Yes, because Paragon is mainly in one end market, and they're talking to their customers daily. I think there's better visibility. And you can also talk to customers and get market information. So this the - talk that we're seeing is really happening everywhere. Just to refresh everybody's memory, Paragon manufactures single-use and consumable surgical instruments and implantable devices, orthopedic implantable devices, drug delivery systems, really attractive markets. At the same time, this is going on. We're working on substantial efficiency improvements in the businesses. We talked about that last quarter and this process is proceeding very well. So this combination of the market growth that follows the destock, along with the new program wins and leaned out and efficient cost structure is really going to provide substantial sales and profit growth for Paragon in the years ahead. We have a similar business and similar markets and another part of AMETEK, and it's seeing the same kind of destock and Paragon won a tremendous amount of new programs. So we're still investing and driving those things in the market. So I think when you take a step back, this is going to be a tremendous generator for our long-term shareholders, and we're very optimistic about the business. It's unfortunate about the destock process, but we're in this game for the long run, and we're doing all the ready things for the business and we've got a new management team with some really talented people from AMETEK that are working with people that are from Paragon and they have a great plan to take the business forward. So we're really optimistic about how that business is going to perform for us long term.
Deane Dray: David, thanks for all that color. Really helpful.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Jamie Cook: Hi. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning.
Jamie Cook: Nice quarter considering the environment. I guess just my first question, can you talk to sort of what price cost was in the quarter by segment and what your expectation is in an environment where organic growth is going to be flat to down single digit. And then my follow-up question, it also struck me about the quarter over the past couple of quarters is the margins in EIG above 30% with mediocre growth. So is there anything like, was there anything unusual to drive the operating margins there. What's structural? What's the risk that some of this goes away if pricing gets more difficult? I'm just trying to understand the performance in EIG margins, the good performance, given a tough macro. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Good questions, Jamie, and I'll try to answer them both. The first thing is you talked about pricing in the quarter. And our pricing in Q2 was about 3.5 points price, and our inflation was about 2.5 points. So we had a positive benefit from that. So the pricing environment is moderating a bit and the inflation is moderating a bit, but we're real pleased with that. And it was across our portfolio and maybe a little bit more in EMG just a bit than EMG, but it was pretty much across the portfolio at a pretty consistent performance, and that's driven by our differentiated portfolio on the heavy level of investments. We're putting in new products. We talked about a vitality index of 24%. We got newer products, fresh products in the market. Our customers are buying them. So - and that's resulting in some good pricing. And as I said, inflation is moderating. And we think that general environment, the moderation of inflation, but our ability to continue to leverage our investments are going to continue throughout the year. So, no change there, very, very consistent and it's kind of the AMETEK portfolio is very differentiated and kind of performed very well. In terms of the margins in EIG, if you think about - we've got a similar performance in the first quarter and excellent operating quarter. We had 320 basis points up driven by high leverage, excellent price cost, strongly performing acquisitions and a really good product mix. And that was consistent from Q2 to Q3. And we see that continuing for the rest of the year. I mean we do have a comp in Q3 margins is a difficult one, because that was a high-margin quarter for us if you look back the past few years. But in general, if you think about EIG, the margins are good and they're going to stay there, and that business is very well positioned. And it's - in our process, our Power and Industrial and our Aerospace businesses, we've got excellent market positions. And then just talking about the EMG part of the business, they had core margins of over 25%. So they got some dilution there because of the acquisition and destocking and automation in our medical businesses. But when we look at our businesses, they're running - both segments are running very well generating excellent margins. I think EIG has historically a bit of a higher margin entitlement, because they sell mainly to end users, and they get the aftermarket revenue stream and EMG is selling more to an OEM customer base, a little bit lower margin. So they're in relation to each other. And I see that continuing. I'm not really concerned that those margins are going to fall off or anything like that. So, does that answer your question, Jamie?
Jamie Cook: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
Jeff Sprague: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Sprague: Good morning. Hope as going well, Dave. Hi, just on Paragon, I want to just make sure I have things dialed right here. I think your comment about a point of headwind, right, is on a total AMETEK basis.
Dave Zapico: Yes.
Jeff Sprague: So that implies $40 million or $50 million. So we're sort of talking about the business being down kind of 8%, 9%, 10% for the year. Is that basically where we're at?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I'd say you're between 10% and 15% is the Paragon. You're right on.
Jeff Sprague: Okay. And then just thinking about EMG, right, I mean the comps are getting fairly easy on a year-over-year basis, but really, the commentary is we should kind of think sequentially, revenues are quite similar to Q2? Or do you actually see a little bit of a step up there?
Dave Zapico: That's a good question. And when we step back and look at this. First, I'll go to orders. Our orders for the past couple of quarters have had small sequential improvements. So like if you go back to Q4 of last year, you have Q1 of this year and now the quarter recently completed, the orders sequentially were up low single-digits each quarter. So I feel like the orders have stabilized. We had a minus 10% organic in Q1. The orders in Q2 organically were minus 4%. And we think in the second half of the year, we're going to have a modest improvement versus the first half. So it kind of feels like the business has really stabilized. When you go to sales, we wanted to derisk the year because and it's really flat. So even though you have a little bit of movement from quarter-to-quarter, and we have a benefit of a tax rate in in Q4, if you back that out and you look at sales the first half of the year versus sales in the second half of the year, then you look at operating profit above the tax line in the first half of the year versus operating profit in the second half of year, it's a 50-50 split. AMETEK traditionally is a 48-52 split. And that's why we think really derisked the year with that 50-50 split in the second half. Now we still have some seasonality in our business. Historically Q4 because the seasonality is always higher than Q3, and we have a typical seasonality there. And again, as Dalip mentioned, we have the benefit of the tax rate in Q4. But we really feel we derisked the year to reflect the current environment, and we think it's going to stay that way through the balance of the year.
Jeff Sprague: And then maybe we could just touch on that tax rate. So assuming 19%, again in Q3, you would imply, I don't know, 14 or 15 in Q4. But the bigger question is just jumping off into 2025. Do we stay at that 17% to 18% range? Or do we move back up into the 19% to 20% range in 2025?
Dave Zapico: Yes. No, you see it right. We moved back up in 2025 to our typical tax rate. We haven't done our planning for 2025, but based on where we're sitting, that's what we would expect.
Jeff Sprague: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Dave Zapico: Hi, Scott. Good to hear from you.
Scott Graham: Likewise. So I want to understand, so the reduction in sales guidance for the year, you indicated that it was essentially three points in EMG One point in EIG and you talked about project delays there. My question is, in your sort of around the horn, you indicated project delays in power. And I was just wondering if there's any vulnerability to project delays spreading into process because you didn't decide anything there?
Dave Zapico: Yes. If I didn't cite it, I should have said the process and power seeing similar activities. I mean, in the power segment, we have some power test and measurement businesses and they sell to multiple markets, including the government customers and there's a little delay there in projects, but we're very well positioned those are just delayed and process is a bit larger and it's more - it's - but it's kind of the same thing. But that was only the change in sales from all of EIG and - which is both process power.
Scott Graham: Okay. Thank you. I want to maybe shift to defense because that's a pretty high-margin business for you guys. Is that sort of push out of shipments? Is that something that you'll see in the third quarter or the fourth quarter? Is there anything more to discuss there?
Dave Zapico: No, I think that on the defense side, for our A&D business, we kept the guide for the year, the same, like plus high single digits. So what we saw in the second quarter was a very good commercial and had some defense delays. But for full year, we're saying that defense and commercial is still going to be the same. They're going to be up high single digits. So there's - doing very well there. As you said, there's good margins in our A&D segment, and we feel confident in that segment.
Scott Graham: If I could just squeeze this last one in, Dave. The net leverage of 1x, it's pretty low for you guys. Just kind of wondering the pump, I assume, is pretty darn primed at this point. How does the pipeline look or how are the sizes of the deals out there? Maybe you can give us a little color.
Dave Zapico: Yes. The pipeline looks really good. The size of the deals are throughout whole spectrum. I mean there are smaller deals, mid-size and larger deals. And as we talked about before, we'll probably buy a big business, for us as deployment of greater than $1 billion in capital every couple of years. And that's just because we're generating so much cash flow I think we really have the opportunity to differentiate our performance in this period. What you really see is there's a lot of PE-owned sponsor businesses that are long in the tooth. They're laying their ownership cycle, and they're struggling now because they have to go back and refinance their businesses at higher rates, and they're also trying to sell the business in a slowing environment. But those are - we have discussions going on, and there's a very, very large pipeline of opportunities that fit our businesses that we're having discussions with. So I'm optimistic that the pipeline is going to be strong and the discussions we're having are good ones. And you remember our capital allocation is very clear. Our first priority is to deploy our free cash flow strategic acquisitions that remains a clear priority. And like we're going to see from Paragon next year, that's how we generate value. And priority two is opportunistic buybacks. And as we've shown in the past, if we see a dislocation in our valuation, we're poised to act. And our third priority is a consistently modestly increasing dividend. So capital allocation doesn't change. And with a net leverage of one, we're ideally positioned right now, and there's a lot activity going on. Does that answer your question, Scott?
Scott Graham: It answers everything fully. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: I understand that the kind of delays here and there that you're talking about aren't the biggest driver in the quarter. But I'm still a little bit curious. And so is the project delay often one where you're a small piece of the total project cost is one question. And the second is probably pretty easy to answer, given the nature of your business. But is there any pushback on price? Do customers have any option to change out? I mean is there any downshifting or anything like that? I know it's unlikely just thought sort of check around those dynamics.
Dave Zapico: Yes. The project cost, I think, was your first question. And you're right …
Rob Wertheimer: Yes.
Dave Zapico: We are typically a small portion of the project and with good technology, a small part of a bigger project. It's a nice place to be. In terms of pricing, we have very differentiated technology. And we're conscious of the value that we're adding. What you'll typically see in most classic downturns is they may mix down. They may buy our project, buy our product, but it will maybe have less, features, because we're pretty good position with the customer base and our positions in our niche portfolio. We're not seeing that now. And we're not seeing the activity pipeline change. So I think on the - we're typically smaller projects typically priced for value and we do a lot of investment in our portfolio. So I think delays are more just related to the general macro that we talked about with Dean, about the elections and some of the uncertainty with the geopolitical issues but we went through the - we're confident we're not losing share. We're confident that our pipelines are very strong. So it's a temporary delay.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks so much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hi. Good morning. This is [technical difficulty] talk about the Paragon charges you took last quarter. Now that you're another quarter in, do you expect any additional charges? I know there were just one-time, but just any update on that? And when you might start seeing any impact from those charges?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think - we don't anticipate another charge. I mean that doesn't mean we won't change our mind, but we don't anticipate any other charges that will be clear. That's clear. Yes, that activity is going on now. So we're in process of improving that business, so fixing that business. So making it run as efficiently as AMETEK does. And we have a team of Paragon people and a team of AMETEK people and a team of our operational excellence, talent across the business, all working on the project. And the response is very, very solid to it. So I think that's ongoing and it will occur through the balance of this year. I think next year, you'll start to see the benefits of it. But the project, if you recall, goes up two or three years, as we continue to improve it. So I think the, next year, you have a sizable improvement, because expect the volumes to come back from the - destock, combined with the OpEx work that's going on combined with some new product introductions that we're heavily investing in the phase-in. So it's unfortunate that we have this destock downturn right now, but we couldn't be happier with the business.
Joe Giordano: Thank you for that. And another question I had was on the 4Q ramp. So I understand the normal cyclicality, there's usually a 4Q ramp. But it does look like the implied guide implies the ramp is more than usual for historical. Is there - especially considering that you guys are not anticipating any easement in destocking for the latter half - could you comment on what's driving that?
Dalip Puri: Yes. I kind of disagree with your conclusion. I think there's a tax benefit in Q4. And when you factor that in, we have a pretty - I think the ramp is very similar to what it was last year. So it's - and we derisked Q3. So as I said, the operating performance in the first half of the year is very similar to the operating performance in the second half year. And you add to that a little bit of a tax benefit in Q4. So I don't - I think it's pretty typical from what we've done in the past.
Joe Giordano: Got it. Thanks for that. Very helpful.
Dalip Puri: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Andrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Just going back to inventory, just how to think about it. Are your OEM customers? Are they bringing inventory levels back to pre-COVID levels or below pre-COVID levels? I guess just trying better understand how to think about the destocking impact versus history? And where do you think inventories will be on a going-forward basis relative to pre-COVID levels?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think there - it's different because there's a lot of customers and a lot of different market segments. But in general, I think you're getting back to pre-COVID levels, there might be slightly higher because of some of the geopolitical things that happened and the supply chains becoming more regional and less dependent on Asia. So it could be a bit higher. But in general, I believe that the general statement across the customer base, they're trying to get back to something at the pre-COVID level. They might be a bit higher for some of the other geopolitical issues going on.
Andrew Obin: Got you. And just - maybe I missed it, but could you just cover major geographies? What are we seeing North America versus Europe versus Asia versus China? I apologize if I missed it.
Dave Zapico: Sure, Andrew. No, you didn't miss it. We saw a modest growth in Europe in the second quarter, and we saw a low single-digit declines in both the U.S. Asia. Go a step lower. We had low single-digit in the U.S. We actually had strong growth in our Materials Analysis division or A&D businesses but our automation business was down a bit. Europe was up low single-digit. Again, weakness in our automation business, offset by strong growth in process. And for Asia, we were down low single digits, pretty difficult comps in China. China was down a bit. But when you look at Asia, excluding China, it was flat. So it's kind of a flat world. But we are seeing some improvements in Europe.
Andrew Obin: Thanks so much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steve Barger: Thanks. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Steve.
Steve Barger: Dave, we're hearing a lot of optimism about the semiconductor cycle having a strong 2025 led by AI-related devices, of course, but also some leading-edge node transitions later next year. What are you seeing in that business? And are you more levered to node transitions or unit volume increases?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think right now, we're levered to both of them. But in our second quarter, our semiconductor business was up, and it was up because we had strong growth in our CAMECA business, and you think about that business, they're doing next-generation defect detection. And it's kind of like you're going to want one of these CAMECA systems in just about every new fab. And then we also have the strong benefits from our Zygo business. And there, we're one of the few businesses that can operate with technology in the EUV, the extreme EUV, and that's more of the transitioning to smaller nodes. So right now, what you see is even though the market was down tremendously, there's a lot of R&D activity to get at the node transitions, to get us some of the - to be able to detect defects at these smaller nodes. So we're going very well there driven by the uniqueness of our product portfolio. But then when the market picks up, we also have a good part of our business is tied to the - just the rate production. So, it feels pretty good for us in terms of moving into next year, Steve.
Steve Barger: Got it. And activity over the past year for mature nodes in domestic Chinese manufacturers have been stronger than I think people expected. Do you have exposure there? And do you have an outlook for that market in the back half and next year?
Dave Zapico: We don't - I don't have that level of resolution for next year. We do sell into the Chinese market. It's typically lower technology products, has been healthy this year.
Steve Barger: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Nigel Coe: Good morning. Hi David, hi Dalip and Kevin. Thanks for the question. Just a few more details. I know you got a lot of ground here. But on Paragon, I just want to make sure I've got the right base for FY '23. I've got about $450 million, $460 million of revenues for FY '23. Is that about right?
Dave Zapico: A little bit higher for '23.
Nigel Coe: A bit high of 23%. Okay. That's helpful. So down 10% to 20% this year, I mean, what sort of cost measures are you taking? I know the charge you took in 1Q is much longer tail. But what measures are you taking to sort of preserve the earnings there? And - where do we stand right now on the accretion for FY '24?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think the - we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure. They have excess capacity in plants - so that work is going on right now. And we took the charges also some expenses related to doing things that are non-accruable that we're spending. And then more importantly, there's a lot of new product introductions that are going on that we're spending that - spending on right now that are very, very solidly positioned for Paragon. You talk about the accretion for this year, it's a couple of pennies and it's in the fourth quarter.
Nigel Coe: Couple of pennies in the fourth quarter. Yes. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, David. And then on orders, I think you said 4% organic decline. I think that's better than the 8% you saw in the first quarter I'm calculating $1.6 billion of orders this quarter. Is that in the right zone?
Dave Zapico: Yes. If you look at overall orders, they were up 1.5% in the quarter.
Nigel Coe: 1.5%, okay, that’s…
Dave Zapico: The overall orders were up 1.5%. Organic orders were down 4%. That's improved from what we saw in Q1 where we were down organically minus 10 and we saw a sequential improvement in orders in Q2. So they're up low-single-digits from Q1. So we're definitely seeing stability in orders. And the cadence…
Nigel Coe: The question about it.
Dave Zapico: June was the strongest.
Nigel Coe: And then just a quick one on the 4Q tax rate issue and any quantification there?
Dalip Puri: Yes. I mean if you think about the way we're seeing our expected tax rate play out, Nigel, Q3, as we said, we're projecting our typical expected tax rate Q4, we're now projecting a lower expected tax rate in the range of 10% to 15%. That lower effective tax rate in Q4 is primarily due to statute expirations. So that brings our expected tax rate for the full year to 17% to 18%, which is expected to provide an earnings benefit in the range of $0.10 to $0.15 per share in Q4.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Thank you very much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Nigel.
Operator: Since there are no more questions, I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Coleman for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Meg. And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to AMETEK's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.
 I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Julia. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. We today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dalip Puri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations.  
 A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2023 or 2024 results or 2024 guidance will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization and excluding the pretax $29.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share charge in the first quarter for integration costs related to the Paragon Medical acquisition. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.  
 We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks, and then we'll open the call for questions.  
 I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave. 
David Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2024 with outstanding operating performance leading to double-digit growth in earnings per share. During the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income and EBITDA, and deliver robust core margin expansion and excellent cash flows. Considering our first quarter results and the positive outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. AMETEK's continued success is a testament to the strength and resiliency of our growth model, the quality of our businesses and the outstanding contributions from all AMETEK colleagues.
 Now let me turn to our first quarter results. Sales in the first quarter were $1.74 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down slightly. Acquisitions added 9 points and foreign currency had a small positive impact. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.96, and we ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $3.46 billion near record levels. AMETEK's operating performance at the start of the year was excellent. Operating income in the quarter was a record $446 million, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2023. Operating margins were 25.7% in the quarter, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, core margins were up a very strong 180 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record at $542 million up 13% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins an impressive 31.2%. This outstanding performance led to earnings of $1.64 per diluted share up 10% versus the first quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.56 to $1.60. 
  Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group had a strong start to the year with tremendous operating performance leading to record operating margins and impressive margin expansion. Sales for EIG were $1.16 billion in the quarter, up 4% from the first quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 1% and acquisitions added 3 points. Growth in the quarter remained strongest across our Aerospace & Defense and Materials Analysis businesses.  
 EIG's operational execution in the first quarter was superb with strong profit and exceptional operating margin expansion. Operating income was $353 million, up 14% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were a record 30.5%, up a robust 280 basis points. This level of operating margin speaks to the quality and leadership positions of our highly differentiated businesses.
 The Electromechanical Group also delivered solid first quarter operating performance despite the headwinds from inventory normalization impacting some of our EMG businesses. EMG's first quarter sales were a record $579 million, up 21% versus the prior year, driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of Paragon Medical and Bison Engineering. First quarter operating income was $120 million, while core operating income margins were 24.1% in the quarter.  
 Our first quarter results reflect the unique capabilities of our growth model to successfully manage short-term market headwinds and deliver robust margin expansion, outstanding cash flow and strong double-digit earnings growth. Our businesses remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives and delivering differentiated technology solutions to support our customers' most complex challenges. Our distributed operating structure enables flexibility in responding to market dynamics, while our robust cash flow and balance sheet provide ample support for our acquisition strategy.  
 This acquisition strategy along with our organic growth initiatives is expanding AMETEK's presence within high-growth markets. These markets include med tech, clean energy, electrification and aerospace and defense and help ensure our diverse portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on these attractive long-term secular growth areas.
 We remain committed to investing across our businesses to accelerate new product development and expand our sales and marketing efforts. In 2024, we expect to invest an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives with a sizable portion of this in support of our research, development and engineering efforts. The effectiveness of these investments is reflected in our vitality index which was a strong 25% in the first quarter.
 AMETEK's commitment to invest in RD&E and continuously innovate ensures a steady stream of new products that support our customers' critical applications and position us for continued success.
 I wanted to take a moment to highlight an example of how the elements of the AMETEK growth model work together to deliver exceptional results. AMETEK Zygo, a global leader in the design and manufacturer of advanced optical metrology systems and ultraprecise optical components was recently awarded AMETEK's Dr. John H. Lux Award, an annual award provided to the AMETEK business that best exemplifies the commitment to continuous improvement and achievements and operational excellence. 
 As part of its market expansion strategy, Zygo identified an attractive new market segment, virtual and augmented reality applications as a compelling growth opportunity for their advanced optical metrology systems. This led to Zygo's new product development and commercial teams working closely together to advance their technology capabilities and commercialize as a solution to support the highly precise requirements of this application. The success of this work resulted in strong demand and the need for Zygo to meaningfully increase production. Utilizing cross-functional teams and deploying tools like value stream mapping, and Lean Six Sigma, they achieved a remarkable threefold increase in production output, allowing them to meet the growing demand for the metrology solution.  
 This achievement highlights the synergy between our new product development, global market expansion and operational excellence strategies to help identify, develop and deliver exceptional technology solutions to address an important market need and accelerate growth. Congratulations to the Zygo team for a job well done.
 Now switching to our acquisition strategy. The acquisitions we completed in 2023 are integrating nicely into AMETEK. We are leveraging our proven integration capabilities and our global infrastructure to help accelerate their growth, drive operational improvements and deliver strong returns. We are very excited about these acquisitions as they are expanding our market presence in attractive growth markets, including the med tech space through the Paragon Medical acquisition.  
 Paragon Medical, which we acquired in December, is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered medical components and single-use and consumable surgical instruments. Paragon has an outstanding brand, leading innovation and design capabilities and a strong position serving a number of high-growth market segments. Our integration efforts are focused on supporting and accelerating this growth, while also leveraging AMETEK's infrastructure and operational excellence capabilities to drive efficiency improvements. The integration charge we took in the first quarter will allow us to drive these improvements and better position Paragon for accelerated growth and profitability. 
 Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we are actively working on multiple opportunities. We have the balance sheet and financial capacity to deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions. We look forward to delivering continued value to our shareholders through strategic acquisitions and prudent capital deployment.
 Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect the impact of inventory normalization to continue through the first half of the year with improvements in the second half of the year as we indicated on our last earnings call. As a result, for the full year, we continue to expect overall sales to be up low double digits on a percentage basis with low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.74 to $6.86, up 6% to 8% compared to last year's results, an increase from the previous guidance range of $6.70 to $6.85. For the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid- to high single digits with earnings of $1.63 to $1.65, up 4% to 5% versus the prior year.  
 In summary, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter with earnings growth, which exceeded our expectations, driven by exceptional operating performance. We are encouraged by these results and remain confident in our ability to navigate the current environment and benefit from improved sales growth in the back half of 2024. We are confident in the future of AMETEK has our world-class talent and the adaptability of the AMETEK road model will continue to drive long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders. 
 I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip? 
Dalip Puri: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong first quarter with record level sales and exceptional operating performance, highlighted by strong core margin expansion and free cash flow conversion.
 Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the first quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $26.4 million or 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's first quarter. For fiscal year 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.4% of sales.  
 First quarter interest expense was $35 million, up $15 million from the prior year first quarter due to higher debt balances outstanding following the December 2023 acquisition of Paragon Medical. Other operating expenses were down $5 million primarily due to higher interest income and higher pension income compared to the prior year's first quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.9%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2023. For 2024, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.
 As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $28 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $160 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $98 million. In 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share.  
 Operating working capital in the first quarter was 18.7% of sales. Operating cash flow was $410 million, up 6% versus the first quarter of 2023, while free cash flow was $383 million, up 4% over the prior year. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion was a strong 123% of net income. For the remainder of 2024, we continue to expect strong free cash flow conversion in the range of 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at March 31 was $2.9 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the end of 2023.  
 Offsetting this debt, it's cash and cash equivalents of $374 million. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and our active acquisition pipeline.
 While acquisitions remain our #1 priority for use of our free cash flow, we also seek to opportunistically repurchase our shares and provide our shareholders with a consistently increasing dividend. And in February, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.28 per share, our fifth consecutive year of 10% plus annual increases.
 In summary, our businesses delivered strong results to start the year with outstanding operating performance, leading to robust core margin expansion and excellent free cash flow.  
 Kevin? 
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Dalip. Julie, can we please open the lines for questions? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC. 
Deane Dray: Can we start off with the usual kind of tour of the end markets and geographies and maybe finish up with the -- just kind of the destocking comments. It just continues to be drawn out, and we're seeing it in all kinds of pockets. So it's not AMETEK specific in any way. But just kind of what's your refresh feel on that as well? 
David Zapico: Sure, sure. Glad to do that all, Deane. I'll start with the walk around the company, and I'll start with our Process business. Overall sales for our Process businesses were roughly flat versus last year and in line with our expectations. Growth remains solid across our energy and semiconductor businesses, and we're really well positioned there to benefit from the sizable project and investment activity within these markets. For the full year, we continue to expect sales for our Process businesses to be up low single digits.
 Next, I'll switch to Aerospace & Defense, and our A&D businesses, had a strong start to the year with approximately 10% organic growth in the quarter. Growth was very solid across both our commercial, aerospace and defense segments and for all of 2024, we continue to expect organic sales for our A&D businesses to be up high single digits on a percentage basis with similar growth across both our commercial aerospace and defense businesses.
 Next, I'll move to Power. Our Power businesses were up low double digits in the first quarter with contributions from the acquisitions of UEI and Amplifier Research being offset by a low single-digit decrease in organic sales. These recent acquisitions along with the acquisition of RTDS in 2022, expanded our presence within a number of highly attractive market segments, which are expected to benefit from a strong investment cycle, including the expansion of renewable energy and the power grid infrastructure. And for the Power segment, we continue to expect low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth for 2024.
 And finally, going to the Automation & Engineered Solutions market segment, overall sales for A&ES were up 20% on a percentage basis in the quarter -- were up mid-20s in the quarter with contributions from the acquisitions of Paragon Medical and Bison Engineering being offset by a high single-digit decrease in organic sales. As we expected, the impact from normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base continued in the first quarter, and we expect to see a return to growth in the second half of the year consistent with what we had indicated last quarter.
 And then finally, as a result, we continue to expect organic sales for our automation businesses to be up low single digits stronger growth in the back half of the year. So that's the walk around the company. And I think you also asked for what's going on in the various geographies. So get to that too, Deane.
 The U.S. was down 1% against a pretty difficult comparison, and our strongest growth was in our aerospace and defense businesses. Moving to Europe, we were down 2%, so minus 2% organic with notable growth in parts of our process and parts of our Power businesses offset by weakness in automation. And in Asia, we were up low single digits with strength across our Process businesses. So we had a very good performance in Asia. And digging down into that a little further, China was flat in the quarter, we saw the growth in our parts of our process businesses. So up low single digits in Asia and China was flat. 
Deane Dray: It's all really help. Go ahead. 
David Zapico: Yes. You asked about the destock, Deane. Yes, I think that it's playing out as we had talked about last quarter. I think the destock will continue into the second quarter, but in the second half of the year, we expect that to turn around. So we're watching that closely and it's really kind of playing out as we thought. I mean, the destock was probably a bit more than we thought it was going to be in Q1, but that may be positive for later in the year because we think second half of the year is just positive. 
Deane Dray: Great. And just a quick follow-up on the growth investments. We know this is your playbook. Is there anything unique in terms of how you're deploying that capital? I mean, typically, it's salespeople, is a component, but any other kind of wrinkles here you could share? 
David Zapico: Yes. It's salespeople with the largest chunk of it is in the engineering, research, development and engineering. And we have a full slate of projects, we have excellent opportunities longer term and we're getting after them. So I'm very positive on what's happening in our new product development programs. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. 
Jeffrey Sprague: Can you just address a little bit more Paragon itself, how it's performing and the charge that you took I don't recall a large charge like this on prior deals, maybe there are smaller ones that you just absorbed but didn't break out, but kind of the nature of what you're trying to accomplish? And is this kind of a onetime deal in this quarter as you kind of bed down the asset? 
David Zapico: Yes, that's a great question, Jeff. And it's kind of what you said. I mean we typically absorb the smaller acquisitions as we proceed through the years and quarters. And the last time we did something like this, when we bought, I believe, Zygo, is a bigger acquisition. And because of the size of the acquisition and because of the opportunities that we see, we wanted to take that integration charge because there are tremendous, tremendous opportunities to improve the business. So it's a onetime nature. It's for larger deals as you know, Paragon was largest acquisition that we have done.
 We spent about $1.9 billion. So as we dug into it, as we work with our management team, we got really comfortable with this plan. Quite honestly, there's more opportunities than we thought. We have a good team of both AMETEK and Paragon leaders that are really getting after it now. So I feel really good about the business.
 The integration is being integrated into AMETEK well, it's very positive around the future. And I think this restructuring is largely going to happen over the next couple of years, and we really see as a less than 2-year payback on it. So excellent payback. And we started on that, and we're really positive of what we're doing, and I feel positive about the deal. 
Jeffrey Sprague: Great. And then maybe just switching gears, and I'm sorry if I missed it, I was on a little bit late, but can we just decompose revenue growth in the quarter for the segments, some color on what the organic performance was at the segment level? And if you have any color on price or other elements of revenue. I'm curious... 
David Zapico: Yes, if you look at -- our overall sales were up 9%. That's because both groups. And go the organic growth was just down modestly, about 0.5 point. EIG overall sales were plus 4. The organic growth in EIG was plus 1%. EMG overall sales were plus 21% and the organic sales at EMG were minus 4. So you had that defines the group dynamics for revenue. 
Jeffrey Sprague: And maybe just 1 last 1 back to this kind of destock question. Just to comment that it was more in Q1 than expected, and I know it's kind of hard to know what your customers are going to do. But just your confidence level that it actually is, in fact, destock and like you have visibility on sell-through being better on the other side? Maybe just kind of address that, if you could? 
David Zapico: Yes, yes. The first point is when you look at AMETEK's first half, second half, we typically have 48% of our revenue and profits in the first half of the year, and 52% of our revenue and profits in the second half of the year, and that's exactly what we have this year. So our second half of the year is not back-end loaded. So we feel good about that.
 Another point that you may not see it really appears our orders have stabilized. Specifically, when I look at Q4 '23 to Q3 '23, and then I look at the next quarter, Q1 '24 the last quarter compared to Q2 '23. So the last 2 quarters sequentially, with all the acquired backlog removed. So really looking at a true run rate sequentially. We've seen low single-digit growth in orders in both Q4 '23 and Q1 '24. So it feels like we've bottomed and we're starting to see some modest improvements. At the same time, in Q1 '23, we had an extremely good quarter. So we have a difficult comp that we're battling.
 And finally, and perhaps most importantly, we've had customer commentary that continues to communicate to us in the second half of the year that destocking phase will come to an end, and we should return to a positive book-to-bill.
 So in terms of the economic environment, we're not -- we're watching it closely, but for the balance of the year, we're just assuming modest economic growth, not any kind of economic acceleration and at the same time, not a recessionary environment. And we expect that we'll grow sales modestly each quarter and the comparables get easier in the second half of the year. And as I said, this 48%, 52% split, H1 to H2 is very much aligned with our historical averages. 
Jeffrey Sprague: And I'm sorry, did you have a comment on price? I missed it, and I'll see the floor. 
David Zapico: That's a good question, Jeff. Pricing was continued to more than offset inflation. Pricing was approximately 4% in the quarter and inflation was about 3%. The results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership position in these niche markets around the globe. And for the full year, we do expect their pricing to come in a bit and inflation to come in a bit, but we expect to maintain a positive spread between them. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey of Mizuho. 
Unknown Analyst: This is [indiscernible] for Brett Linzey. So as we look at a more potentially more aggressive tariff regime, can you just talk about how nimble your supply chain configuration is and then your ability to flex around different regions if needed? 
David Zapico: Yes, it's a great question. I mean we look at tariffs, and that became a bigger issue back in the 2017 time frame. And in the quarter, we had a minimal impact from tariffs and they were completely offset for price. And to give you an idea across the whole company, tariffs are only going to cost us about $0.01, a $3 million or $4 million. And what happened there is we've aggressively rebalanced our supply chain. It's largely done. So we're not overexposed to any region of the globe. And we have a strategy where from the U.S., we're largely sourcing from Mexico and other regions of the Americas and in Europe. We do a lot of sourcing from to Czech Republic and Serbia. And in Asia, we do a lot of sourcing from Malaysia.
 So we've got a nice balance around the world. So I think the hard work that we did over the past few years are really rebalancing our supply chain. We're essentially finished with it, just very small bit of work that continues. And we're very well positioned to be able to deal with an increasing tariff regime, specifically with China, in particular, we don't have a real risk there. We do excellent business in China. It's a China kind of strategy is about 9% of our sales. And largely, we source what we sell in China. So we're in a pretty good position in terms of tariffs. 
Unknown Analyst: Perfect. And then if you can just provide some color on the tempo or monthly cadence of trends in the quarter and then looking into April? 
David Zapico: Yes. I mean it was a pretty typical quarter. March was the strongest -- excuse me, March was the strongest quarter. Wait a minute. Okay, yes, pretty typical quarter, with March being the strongest on both orders and sales. So it's -- sales were the highest of the quarter in March and then in April, we're right on plan. So we feel good about the guidance. And it's pretty -- as I said, it's bouncing around there. But we're not seeing any incremental weakness at this point. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of Seaport Research Partners. 
Scott Graham: Really, maybe the first question is about the M&A environment. EBITDAs do seem to have firmed up even though this first quarter, I think, most would say industrial land has been a little uneven. Nevertheless, when EBITDA is firm up, that's kind of when I think the AMETEK does a lot of striking. And I'm just wondering, are we looking at a year this year that could mirror last year? I mean what is like the really near-term pipeline look like, Dave? 
David Zapico: Yes, it's very, very difficult to predict the very near term. But Scott, the pipeline remains very strong, and we're actively looking at a number of high-quality deals across a broad set of markets. So we have $1.8 billion of existing cash and credit facilities post Paragon. We have a balance sheet that would support -- if the deals meet our criteria, we could do over $4 billion of deals this year, and that would only take our leverage up to about 2.5x. So we're really in an excellent position. And it's not a balance sheet issue. It's not a cash flow issue.
 We're performing extremely well. it comes down to finding the right businesses, and we have a good pipeline right now, a very good pipeline. And we really have the opportunity, as you said, we typically have this opportunity to differentiate our performance with the M&A element of our growth strategy with this strong balance sheet and with the strong cash flow position. So in this market is a bit choppy. Our combination of OpEx and M&A and this proven acquisition strategy, I'm really looking to differentiate our performance with our M&A and our OpEx during the next couple of quarters. 
Scott Graham: You answered one of Jeff's questions earlier, saying you're expecting sales to be up modestly each quarter. Were you referring to organic for the next 3 quarters? 
David Zapico: Yes. This is sequential, Scott. 
Scott Graham: Okay. So sequentially, you're expecting sales dollar to be up. 
David Zapico: Q1 will be a bit higher than Q2, Q3 a bit higher than Q2 and Q4 will be a bit higher than Q3. 
Scott Graham: Okay. And the last one is just sort of back on the orders. I know you do have a pretty significant comp that you're up against when you stack them. What were orders in the quarter in dollars and in organic? 
David Zapico: Yes. The orders were -- orders were minus 8 and organic orders were minus 10. And again, we had a tough comp, and I went through the process of they sequentially grew low single digits the last couple of quarters. When you take out the comp, I think in Q1 of '23, we had exceptional orders from some project business and EIG in particular. So when you take that out and you look at what's going on sequentially, we get more comfortable. 
Scott Graham: Yes. No, I get it, '22 and '21 were also exceptional organic periods for you. 
David Zapico: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. 
Andrew Obin: Just a question, how to think about the Paragon Medical integration costs. So what's the payback on this restructuring that's now -- because I assume it's extra. So what's the payback on this restructuring that's embedded in '24 guide? And how much of it should I add to '25? 
David Zapico: Yes. Well, in '24, we had told you in prior meetings that Paragon is going to contribute $0.08 to $0.10 to AMETEK's EPS, and that still holds. When I look at that $22 million charge, we said the payback is going to be less than 2 years, and at run rate, so it will take us a couple of years to get there. But the run rate, we have $70 million of benefit. So we spent approximately $29 million. We're going to get approximately $70 million of benefits. The payback is less than 2 years. So that really tells you what a great return it has, and it's just -- there wasn't a lot of focus, and we can run things really efficiently. And I'm just excited that the management team sees it that way, too, and we're really going to make Paragon an exceptional business from an operating perspective.
 Regarding 2025, I think we've come out and said that we should see a substantial increase in operating earnings related to Paragon in 2025. But I'm not willing to quantify what's going to happen in 2025. We're much too far away to do that. But again, the metrics I'd point you to are we spent $29 million. We'll see $70 million in benefit at max run rate. And the payback for the project is a little less than 2 years. So we feel really good about it, good payback for our shareholders. 
Andrew Obin: Sorry, I'd probably -- and I'd probably take it offline, but just to make sure, so I thought the Paragon restructuring was extra because you saw incremental opportunities. So you were saying that I should have -- that, that was embedded all along but was not in the guide. I'm sorry... 
David Zapico: I just think that it's a larger deal, and we saw a lot of opportunities over -- it will take us a few years to do it so we put it forward. 
Andrew Obin: Okay. I'll take it offline because I'm not sure if I -- so I should have had it in my numbers or this $0.10 is extra on top of view we're thinking, just confirming that, I apologize. And I'm happy to take it offline with Kevin, I apologize. 
David Zapico: Yes. I don't know what you have in your numbers, Andrew. I don't really look at them, but I can tell you that we're expecting to get $0.08 to $0.10 of benefit from Paragon and this restructuring doesn't change that. 
Andrew Obin: Got you. That makes sense. And then just on revenue and you did give very good color was basically the destock what drove -- I guess you were expecting I think you guided for low double-digit revenue in the first quarter, a little bit below. So it's just you said it's destock pulled forward, correct? 
David Zapico: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. 
Christopher Glynn: Dave, I was curious just to go into the top a little bit of the long-term multiyear kind of secular trends where you see an impact. It occurs to me maybe the Power business could be on your leading edge with energy transition and electrification. But curious your comments in general on the kind of secular trends, and in particular, what you're seeing as kind of street level evidence on reshoring type trend. 
David Zapico: Yes. I think the -- when I think about the long-term secular growth drivers, and we talked about a little -- a few of them in my talk, but a lot of project activity around the semiconductor market, and that's finally we're moving closer and closer to the point where that's going to start turning into business for us in the West. There's a lot of project work on semiconductors.
 The Power market, as you said, and there are really two drivers there, the driver for renewables, energy but also the driver for investments in the power grid. So our RTDS business or power instrumentation business are really levered to those. So that's starting to happen as work its way through.
 When I think about the Aerospace & Defense business. Again, we had a great quarter again, and that's continuing. And I think both Airbus and Boeing have a 9-year backlog for the commercial market looks good. Our defense -- we're in the right position in defense. We had another good quarter in defense. So I think about those kind of markets and those trends, I feel good about the future, and a lot of fiscal stimulus in the U.S., which has not been there in the past. And -- but it takes time to work through the system. So we think longer term, I think we're in the right places to do well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of T.D. Cowen. 
Unknown Analyst: This is Dan on for Joe. Sorry, I know destocking and bottoming of orders within automation has been discussed a few times. So just a quick follow-up. This is obviously something a lot of companies have been struggling with in the past few quarters. But some have also been talking about changing their internal processes to gain more visibility of end market and end users. Is there anything that you guys have done potentially more frequent conversations or reaching out to like end market users to understand a bit better their demand going forward? Anything you've changed recently? 
David Zapico: I can't point to anything to change. I mean if you go back and you follow us, we kind of call exactly what happened. We talked about the first half of the year of sales outpacing orders. So that means you'd have a slightly below 1 book-to-bill.
 And we talked about the destock in the first half, and we thought it would turn positive in the second half. We did that before this quarter. I think we have a pretty robust communication system with our field, but there's always opportunities to get better and we work on those and continuously improve our businesses. But I feel like the information that we got from the field is pretty accurate, and we're on top of it. So -- but there's always room to improve, and we're always looking at ways to improve. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. 
Nigel Coe: David, I just want to come back to the order math. I think you said down 8% and then down 10% organic. 
David Zapico: Right. 
Nigel Coe: We've got about 9 points of contribution from Paragon in our numbers. So just wondering what am I missing, I've expected that there would be significant contribution from Paragon in the order numbers. So just help me out with that math, please. 
David Zapico: Yes. We had 9% acquisition growth, and Paragon is in the acquisition is not the organic. So the Paragon sales orders -- sales, excuse me. Yes. 
Nigel Coe: Okay. But then the orders, 8% organic to, that makes sense, reported downtimes in organic. Was there no material impact from Paragon there? 
David Zapico: Yes. With Paragon, we had obviously, the large -- look the backlog as orders in Q4. And then in Q1, there's a timing issue because Paragon has gone through the same destock that the EMG business is. So there's a bit of a destock there. That impacts the orders.
 So the medical market, it's in both our EMG business and Paragon, we're seeing the same kind of destock in the EMG businesses. If we look at the medical procedures, they're all growing at mid- to high single digits, but the medical device OEMs are destocking their inventory, correcting their inventories. It's kind of a widely communicated piece of information, and we monitor the procedures, and they're growing. So this destock we think is going to run a space through the first half of the year. 
Nigel Coe: Okay. Does that impact the full year forecast? I think we've got close to $5 million of sales Paragon, does that destock impact that outlook. But also... I do. 
David Zapico: Go ahead. 
Nigel Coe: No, no. Please go ahead, Dave. 
David Zapico: Yes. I think for the year, when we bought Paragon, it was a little less than $500 million. And the first year, we talked about the mid-single-digit growth. So that's still exactly what we have in our model. So we think that we get out of this year, and we think it will be a double-digit grower over the next couple of years, but the Paragon model from the viewpoint of what we had going into the year and what it is now is pretty much identical. 
Nigel Coe: Okay. And then just, sorry, a follow-up on the $29 million. Is that all restructuring? Or is there some inventory and accounting break down? 
David Zapico: Yes. I'd say the vast majority of it was restructuring, and there was a small part of it that were other integration costs. But the vast majority... 
Nigel Coe: And does some of that come into 2Q as well? Do we think about that into 2Q? 
David Zapico: Yes. We started the effort in Q1 and as I said, we pulled forward all the benefits that we had. And I think the restructuring is -- was done in Q1. So I don't think we're going to have another restructuring charge in Q2, if that's what you're asking.
 It's a one-off charge. It's a one-off charge. The Zygo business, we had a big acquisition. We did a similar thing when we got comfortable with what we could do. And we may have another charge with Paragon down the road if we think there's other ways to improve it. But right now, this is a onetime charge to dramatically improve the operating capability of that business and the returns that I communicated to you are very positive. 
Operator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, for closing remarks.

Dave Zapico : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the financial results for the quarter, it is with mixed emotions that I share the news of changes in our financial leadership, which we announced on January 16. After an outstanding 36-year career at AMETEK, our Chief Financial Officer, Bill Burke, has decided to embark on a well-deserved retirement effective April 2, 2024. Bill's tremendous leadership of our finance organization and his strategic guidance has been instrumental in AMETEK's long-term growth and success. His legacy is deeply woven into the fabric of our organization, and we express our heartfelt gratitude for his exceptional contributions. In light of this transition, I'm delighted to announce the appointment of Dalip Puri as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Dalip, currently serving as Senior Vice President, Operational Finance, brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role. Dalip joined AMETEK in 2017 as Treasurer and subsequently took on the role of Group Controller, providing financial oversight for over half of AMETEK's businesses before transitioning into his current role of Operational Finance. Dalip's leadership of key financial initiatives at AMETEK, along with a proven track record make him the natural choice to lead our financial organization into the future. I'm confident that under Dalip's leadership, our financial organization will continue to thrive contributing significantly to the success of AMETEK. To ensure a seamless transition, Bill will stay on as a senior adviser until April 2025. Thank you, Bill, for your exceptional service, and congratulations Dalip. I'm truly excited about the future. Now let me turn to this quarter's results. AMETEK delivered exceptional performance in the fourth quarter, delivering record results and outstanding operational execution, leading to results ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we set records for sales, operating income, earnings per share, EBITDA and cash flow. We also ended the quarter with record backlog. Furthermore, in the quarter, we successfully deployed over $2 billion on strategic acquisitions, enhancing our portfolio with the acquisitions of Amplifier Research and Paragon Medical. These results cap a record year for acquisitions and underscore the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our businesses and the success of our organic growth initiatives. AMETEK's continued success is also the result of the dedicated efforts of our global employees. I want to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your efforts and significant contributions in 2023. Now let me turn to our fourth quarter financial results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.73 billion, up 6.5% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was approximately 1.5%. Acquisitions added 4 points and foreign currency added 1 point. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.53 billion which is up 10% from the start of 2023. AMETEK's operational performance in the quarter was outstanding, with robust margin expansion and strong incremental margins. Operating income in the quarter was a record $445 million, a 12% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating margins were 25.7% in the quarter, up an impressive 120 basis points from the prior year while core margins were up 200 basis points in the quarter. This strong margin expansion reflects the strength and flexibility of our operating model and the quality and differentiation of our businesses. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $526 million, up 8% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins an impressive 30.4%. Our strong growth and operating performance led to robust cash generation with free cash flow up 47% in the quarter to a record $481 million. This tremendous operating performance led to record diluted earnings per share of $1.68, up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.63 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments grew by an excellent quarter with strong sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG were a record $1.24 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 3.5%, acquisitions added three points with currency accounting for the balance. EIG sales growth in the fourth quarter was strongest across our Aerospace & Defense businesses and our Materials Analysis division. EIG's operating performance was impressive with strong profit growth and exceptional margin expansion. Operating income was a record $359 million, up 17% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 29%, up and outstanding 250 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also finished the year with strong performance despite the continued impact from the normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base. Fourth quarter sales for EMG were $495 million, up 6% versus the prior year, driven by the contributions from recent acquisitions. EMG's fourth quarter operating income was $112 million, while operating margin -- operating income margins were 22.7% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, EMG core margins were up 100 basis points versus the prior year. Now for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2023, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.6 billion, up 7% from 2022. Organic sales increased 4%, with acquisitions accounting for the balance of the growth. Operating income for 2023 was $1.7 billion, up 14% and operating margins were 25.9% for the full year, with margins up 150 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $2 billion with EBITDA margins are very strong 30.5%. In full year 2023, earnings were $6.38 per diluted share up 12% versus the prior year. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year highlights the strength of the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated businesses are strategically aligned with diverse and attractive markets while our organic growth initiatives position us for sustained long-term growth. Our distributed operating structure empowers our businesses to execute on our growth strategies and quickly adapt to evolving market dynamics. This structure is a cornerstone of the success and navigating throughout different economic cycles. Furthermore, our asset-light business model and strong operational execution result in exceptional cash flow generation. This robust cash flow, coupled with our strong balance sheet, provides AMETEK with plenty of firepower to support our growth initiatives and to deploy on acquisitions. Speaking of acquisitions, we were very active in 2023, successfully deploying approximately $2.25 billion on five acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Amplify Research and Paragon Medical in the fourth quarter. I'm very excited to welcome all acquired companies to AMETEK. Each acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with AMETEK as they help expand our product and technology offerings and highly attractive growth markets and applications including renewable energy development and the modernization of the Power group. In addition, our latest acquisition, Paragon Medical, which we closed in the middle of December, nicely expands our presence in the medical technology market. Paragon is a leading manufacturer specializing in highly engineered medical components and single-use and consumable surgical instruments. Their product portfolio spans crucial medical applications and the reputation for quality and precision has earned on the trust of a diverse customer base, including top-tier medical device OEMs. Looking ahead to 2024. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust. As noted, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet and anticipate remaining active deploying capital and acquisitions. In addition to our acquisition strategy, AMETEK remains committed to making strategic investments in organic growth initiatives. In 2023, we invested an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives. And in 2024, we expect to invest another incremental $100 million. The majority of this investment will be within our research, development and engineering and sales and marketing functions. In the quarter, our vitality index, which reflects sales from new products introduced in the last 3 years was a very healthy 29%. Through these strategic investments and acquisitions, we have seen a steady transition of AMETEK's portfolio, with an expanded presence in secular growth markets and reduced exposures in more cyclical markets. This strategic evolution of the portfolio, combined with our proven operational acumen, positions AMETEK well for continued strong and sustained growth. Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. For 2024, we expect overall sales to be up low double digits on a percentage basis with low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $6 to $6.85, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up low double digits with adjusted earnings of $1.56 to $1.60 per share, up 5% to 7% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the full year of 2023 was outstanding. Our businesses delivered exceptional results with all elements of the AMETEK growth model, playing a key role in our success. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. I appreciate your kind words at the top of the call. As Dave noted, I have made the decision to retire after 36 years with AMETEK, nearly eight of which I had the privilege of serving as Chief Financial Officer. I want to express my deepest gratitude and thanks to the entire AMETEK family for the incredible journey we've shared. It has been an honor to contribute to the tremendous growth and success of AMETEK. To Dave and the Board of Directors, thank you for your confidence in me. Your support and leadership have been invaluable. And to my colleagues, your dedication has been the driving force behind our share of success and I am truly thankful for the privilege of working closely with you. I look forward to remaining with the company as a senior adviser until April 2025 to ensure a seamless transition. I'm confident in Dalip's leadership and in the very strong and talented financial organization at AMETEK. Before I get into the results for the fourth quarter, Dalip would like to say a few words. Dalip?
Dalip Puri: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to meeting and working with all of you in the new future. I too want to express my thanks to Dave, to Bill, to the Board of Directors and the leadership team for their trust and confidence in me. It is an honor to serve as AMETEK's EVP and CFO and I'm very excited to lead AMETEK's incredible finance organization and to partner with Dave as we continue to deliver sustained and strong growth across our portfolio of businesses. I also want to express my thanks to Bill for his guidance and mentorship over the years and his commitment to a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Bill.
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dalip. Now on to the fourth quarter results. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2023 with outstanding operating performance leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2024. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $26.3 million, up $3 million from the prior year but unchanged at 1.5% of sales. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $7 million and as a percentage of sales were 1.5%, in line with 2022 levels. In 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.4% of sales. Fourth quarter other income and expense was additional expense, $7 million compared to the fourth quarter 2022, driven by higher due diligence costs and lower pension income. For 2024, we expect other income and expense to be largely in line with 2023 levels. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.8%, down from 18.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to statute expirations. For 2024, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures were $60 million in the fourth quarter and $136 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be approximately $160 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $92 million, and for the full year was $338 million. 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 17.2% of sales. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was superb with operating cash flow of record of $541 million, up 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was also a record in the quarter, up 47% to $481 million with free cash flow conversion of 140% for the quarter. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.6 billion, up 58% versus the prior year and 122% of net income. For 2024, we expect free cash flow conversion to be between 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at year-end was $3.31 billion, up from $2.39 billion at the end of 2022 due largely to the Paragon acquisition in December. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $410 million. As Dave noted, during the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $2 billion on the acquisitions of Amplifier Research and Paragon Medical. Our gross leverage was 1.5x at the end of 2023, up from 1.2x at the end of 2022, despite deploying approximately $2.25 billion on acquisitions during the year. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital and have approximately $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2023, delivering strong growth and a high quality of earnings. We are well positioned for continued growth and success in 2024. Thank you once again, and now I'll turn it back to Kevin.
Kevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Bill. Tanya, can we please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson.
Matt Summerville: Thanks, good morning, and congrats, Bill. I wanted to first ask about the EMG business and the inventory normalization you're seeing there. Using a baseball analogy, what inning are we in with respect to that normalization? And when do you start to see inflection in organic orders within EMG. So if you can first maybe start by elaborating there? And then I have a follow-up.
David Zapico: Sure. Sure, Matt. Maybe the first thing I want to do is -- and the outlook for 2024, Kevin told me that it may have not come through clearly. The diluted EPS for the year is $6.70 to $6.85. So that's just maybe a correction of what I had said before, if it didn't come through clearly. And now I'll get to your question, Matt. I mean we think that as we talked about the OEM parts of our business and we think that OEM destocking largely played out as we expected during Q4. We expect it to continue through the first half of the year. We're going to have some difficult comps in Q1 that will finish in Q2, and then we're going -- we're pretty good for the second half of the year, the way we're forecasting. So the -- again, we're working off our backlog right now. So it's not an immediate impact on revenue. But that destock will continue for the first half of the year, probably a bit more in Q1 than Q2, but we think will be good for the second half of the year. And it's already starting to happen. Some customers are having corrected their inventory levels, but it will continue through the first half of the year.
Matt Summerville: Got it. And then can you review what you experienced in terms of price capture in '23 over '22 and what we should be thinking about in '24 and ultimately, what that price cost relationship looks like this year?
David Zapico: Yes, sure. In the fourth quarter, price was about 5% of sales. And total inflation was about 3.5%. And when we transition to 2024, we really see inflation decreasing. So the time where we had very significant price increases to be at or above inflation is coming to an end. And we think pricing in 2024 would be about 3% across the entire portfolio, and we think inflation will be at about 2.5%. And so we maintain a positive spread. We have the product differentiation. We're creating value. You see our new products are selling very well. But we budgeted, I would say conservatively at 3% price capture during 2024.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just to add my congrats to Bill and Dalip, that is just the epitome of a distinguished career. So congratulations, and you'll be missed.
Bill Burke: I appreciate that, Deane. Thank you very much.
Deane Dray: Dave, maybe you can take us through the key end markets and what you're seeing in terms of demand orders. And then what does Paragon do in terms of increasing your percent of medical? Is that in the range that you're comfortable with? And how do you expect to grow it from there?
David Zapico: Yes, I'll start with that. With the Paragon acquisition, our portfolio has about 21% of sales into the med tech space. And we like to see that even larger. So we're still looking for acquisition in that space, and we plan to grow nicely within that space. And in fact, in the fourth quarter Q4, we were up mid-single digits with strong growth on our EMC and Roland businesses before we got Paragon integrated. So we're happy with the space. We want to continue to grow it, and we're still looking for deals in the space. Now I'll go around the horn, per se, I look at our various subsegments and end markets, and I'll start with our Process businesses, which are the largest component of our subsegments. And organic sales for Process were up low single digits in the quarter, completing a strong year that saw a broad-based growth across the segment. Growth was strongest within our CAMECA and Zygo businesses given their strong technology position with attractive research optics and medical applications. We look to 2024, we expect organic sales for the Process businesses to be up low single digits for the full year. So it's a low single digit in 2023, low single digits in 2024. Aerospace & Defense, strong fourth quarter to complete an excellent year. Growth was broad-based across all segments. Organic growth was up high single digits in the quarter. The growth was balanced across our commercial and aerospace businesses. And for 2024, we expect the organic sales of the Aerospace & Defense businesses to again be up high single digits with similar growth across commercial aerospace and defense. I'll move to our power businesses. They were up low double digits in the fourth quarter with contributions from the acquisitions of RTDS, UEI and Amplifier Research being offset by low single-digit organic sales growth. Our power businesses have been very active on the acquisition front with 3 highly strategic acquisitions over the past 15 months. These acquisitions broaden our exposure to attractive applications tied to renewable energy and modernization of the power grid. For 2024, we expect organic sales for the Power & Industrial businesses to be up low to mid-single digits. So there's some project -- that business is more impacted by certain projects, and we feel pretty good that we're going to be able to grow low to mid-single digits in 2024, some positive project evolutions. And then finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions, the segment was up mid-single digits in the quarter, with contributions from the acquisitions of Paragon Medical and Bison Engineering, being offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in organic sales. Results were in line with expectations with the impact of the normalization of inventory levels that Matt asked about across our OEM customer base, and they really continued in the quarter as expected, and we expect them to continue into 2024. In 2024, we expect the Automation & Engineered Solutions business to be up low single digits with stronger growth in the back half of the year as our customer base normalizes inventory levels than in the first half. So the second half for that sun single will be stronger growth in the first half. That's around the horn, Deane.
Deane Dray: That's fabulous. I appreciate it. And just it's remarkable how we're seeing that momentum from '23 carry into your expectations for '24. And just one quick follow-up on the $100 million in growth investments? How does that stack up in terms of the product categories? Is there anything -- is it skewed in one way or the other? Is it evenly distributed? And where does new product vitality go from here? You're 29% this quarter, your 26% last quarter. Is there a target in mind?
David Zapico: Yes. I think anywhere between 20% and 30% is a good number. So that's what we've always said. And we started tracking this, it was back in the 15% range. So we certainly have made tremendous progress with our new product development efforts. In terms of where the $100 million comes from, it's really bottom up. So our business units put plans together. And if they want to go beyond what they invested in the prior year, we will pitch those plans and their budgeting and it's spread across the business. It goes at our best growth opportunities, and it's going to be about $100 million this year.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Congrats, Bill and look forward to working with you, Dalip. Just following on Deane's R&D question. The $100 million is incremental from the '23 that did $1 million that you did $100 million, as you push into this med tech space, does that number need to go up higher? I mean I'm just trying to think through the investment needed to continue those trajectories for those business?
David Zapico: Yes. We're currently investing just under 5.5% of sales on research, development and engineering. And as we buy higher technology businesses, that number will increase modestly. I think this year, we expect to spend $400 million on RD&E, which is up a good healthy double-digit amount on the total R&D spend. So our R&D is a key part of our business. We have a lot of industrial technology products that we want to maintain leadership positions in. It allows us to get the pricing that we can get because we're providing unique value to our customers. I don't think you're going to see a big jump anywhere, but it's happening as we naturally evolve our portfolio to higher technology products.
Allison Poliniak: Great. And just any color on M&A. You obviously had a record year last year, still in a good position from a leverage standpoint. What are you seeing or what are we expecting? I know you mentioned med tech is sort of a vertical you want to go into? Where are you seeing the greatest opportunities? Any difference in terms of size that we should be thinking through? Just any thoughts there.
David Zapico: No, I think we're looking at the more traditional size deals. And we're also -- we have a few of the larger size deals in our pipeline, and I would characterize Paragon on the outer edge of the larger size. We're very happy with the 5 deals that we got done. We deployed $2.25 billion. We did it across our business in different parts of it. They were high-quality additions. They expanded our presence in attractive growth markets. We have a very clear path to add value to these companies. Each business has a strong technology position. The deals will meet our traditional financial hurdles. Remember, it's a 10% return on invested capital in year 3. In terms of our pipeline, our pipeline remains very strong. And we are actively looking at a number of high-quality deals across a broad set of markets. As always, we'll remain disciplined when we do this. And I really think that we have the opportunity to differentiate our performance with the M&A element of our growth strategy, combined with our balance sheet and cash flow positions. I mean we excel and the markets are slowing or choppy because we had great OpEx and great M&A, and we see tremendous values in the market that we're tracking. The way the market is evolving, it's probably going to be 2, 3, 4 -- second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, with the bulk of the opportunities are. So -- but really, this year, the pipeline looks good, and we're optimistic.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Jeffrey Sprague. of Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Sprague: Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just on deals, Dave. I think on Paragon, you're expecting most or the accretion to really kick in, in 2025, not so much '24. But can you just give us a little color on what is the EPS impact embedded in your guide for Paragon in '24 and the other deals also?
David Zapico: Well, sure. Related to Paragon specifically, during the first half of the year, we're going to be doing some -- expect some muted growth for a couple of reasons. One, there is an inventory correction going on in the medtech market and we're going to look at the portfolio and potentially prove some less product -- less profitable product areas. So there's a whole process that we're going to go through during this first half. And -- but all that said, we're expecting the second half to be very strong because they got some new product introductions that are very exciting. But we continue to expect within the -- in our guidance is 8% to 10% accretion in 2024. And this is back-end loaded as we layer in the integration costs.
Bill Burke: Is that what clarifying? $0.08 to $0.10?
Jeffrey Sprague: Yes, $0.08 to $0.10. Yes. And then just drilling a little bit further into some of the end markets, thanks for kind of going and doing it around the world. But kind of the semi-related markets in particular, which have kind of been the vein of a lot of people that exist in here recently kind of looking for the bottom and the turn. Like what are you seeing in those markets? What do you see in the quarter specifically? And how does 2024 look?
David Zapico: We have a little different dynamic in semiconductor, and I talked about it on a couple of past calls because we have the memory downturn that a lot of people are seeing. We saw that too. But at the same time, we have some exceptional technology in our CAMECA business. It's a next-generation technology that's really is in demand in just about all fabs. And we also have our Zygo business. We're one of the few companies that can manufacture EUV, extreme ultraviolet optics and semiconductor fabrication. So those are two growing dynamics. It's a good place to be. They were able to offset some of the weakness we had in the -- I'll call it, the core memory part of the portfolio. And for 2023, we ended up 10%. So it was a growing market for us. And for 2024, we expect to additionally grow another plus mid-single digit. So largely because of the technology, we were able to grow in '23, and we think we'll continue to grow in '24.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And, Bill, congratulations on your retirement. So just a few border lines for me for '24. The guidance for revenue growth of low double digits I've got high single digits coming in from M&A, obviously, mainly Paragon. Is that the right kind of ballpark about 9% coming in from M&A, which implies sort of 2%, 3% organic. Is that the right level?
David Zapico: You're in the ballpark, Nigel.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just anything to call out on incremental margins across both segments. We're coming off some pretty tough comps in EIG. So just curious, how we should think about maybe overall margins, but more importantly, core incremental margins.
David Zapico: Are you talking about for 2024 or 2023?
Nigel Coe: 2024.
David Zapico: 2024?
Nigel Coe: Yes.
David Zapico: Yes. I mean we had a fantastic margin year in 2023 and margins were up. Core margins were up 200 basis points in the fourth quarter, reported margins are up 120 basis points. EIG had a great quarter. EMG, it was dilutive because of acquisitions. And when you peel away what was going on, they're actually up 100 basis points. So really good margins, really good incremental. And we think for 2024, they're going to moderate a bit. They're going to continue to grow them, but they're going to moderate a bit. And for 2024, we believe that core margins are going to be up 30 basis points. We think that the core incremental are going to be up about 30 basis points. And we have built on our model cost reductions and pricing and things like that, but the whole thing that's to the core margins being up 30 and the core incremental is up 30 basis points. When you look at as reported margins for the year, those will be down probably about 50 basis points due to acquisition dilution. So that's the whole story.
Nigel Coe: Okay. That's really helpful. And then just quickly on geographies. You've gone through the end markets but just wondering if there's anything to call out in '24 geographically?
David Zapico: Yes, I'll do a summary of Q4 geographically, so you know where we stand. And we had growth in the quarter led by the U.S. and Asia. So the U.S. has been strong all along. Asia is picking up a bit. The U.S. was up mid-single digits with notable strength in our Materials Analysis division and Aerospace & Defense, Europe was down high single digits, driven in part by our automation business. And Asia was up about a little under 10%, about 9% with strength in our Materials Analysis division and our Ultra Precision Technology division. We have a dynamic that was a little different than what's going on in the general marketplace. Our China sales were up 22% in Q4. So that -- they were up about 14%, 15% in the year, 22% in Q4. Strong growth in our Materials Analysis division and UPT. When we look into 2024, we think we'll grow in Asia, but we think China is going to moderate to more of a flattish market because there was some -- one of project businesses that we benefited from. So it's still going to be good for us, but we are seeing the broader impacts on the economy, and we think it will be flattish on an orders basis in 2024 in China, and we'll grow in Asia.
Operator: Our next question will be coming from Scott Graham of Seaport Research Partners.
Scott Graham: Hi, good morning. Bill, congratulations on a great run. It's been a complete pleasure working with you. I hope you remain happy invest to your family. Thank you.
Bill Burke: Thank you very much, Scott. Appreciate it.
Scott Graham: I was hoping, Dave, you could go through the orders a bit for the quarter, both in total and organically?
David Zapico: Yes. Sure. The -- let me make sure I'm looking at the right stuff here. Yes, the orders in total for the quarter we're up 16%. Now that was largely driven by the Paragon acquisition because the orders get booked as backlog the first when you acquire a business. So that 16% orders, EIG orders were up 3% and EMG orders were up 43%. And again, the EMG orders were driven by Paragon. Organically, the orders were minus 2%, and it translated into a book-to-bill of 1.10.
Scott Graham: And would you expect, Bill, that sometime in the first half, perhaps the second quarter that the orders may be really kind of flatten out for you organically and then start to progress into the second half?
David Zapico: Yes. I think in the first quarter, we have some pretty difficult comps. So I expect a similar trend with orders trailing sales. But then as we get out in the second half of the year, maybe even in the second quarter, I think the orders will outpace sales. Yes.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you. And then might just one other question. Within the guidance, I guess, I was a little bit surprised at the level of organic you're expecting in a good way. And it looks to me off of your summary that, that's stemming from the aerospace and defense businesses. Would you mind parsing out for the total company kind of what you're expecting in sort of Aerospace versus Defense this year and maybe tack on what the drivers are, particularly in commercial?
David Zapico: Yes. I mean the overall organic growth for the company is a low to mid-single-digit number, and that's going to be in both groups, EIG and EMG. And in terms of Aerospace, we think we're going to grow about the same level that we did this year at plus high single digits. And we have really good diversity in that business. And the military orders are strong, and the commercial OE aftermarket are strong, and the commercial OE are good, too. So we think largely the -- both the military and the total commercial markets are going to be up high single digits in 2024. Pretty optimistic about that.
Operator: Our next question will come from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. So first question is just on growth into '24 and maybe even beyond on the growth algorithm. It seems like your expectations starting out the year is more price-led than volume. And I assume, obviously, some of the destock or channel that you talked about is holding that back. But as we get into 2H, are we looking at return to normal volume growth? And then maybe we're in place environment. I don't know if you have a bigger picture view on where pricing is going? Are we in more of a 3% world and as volume comes back, that kind of ticks up core as we exit the year? That's my first question.
David Zapico: Yes. That very well could happen, Rob. I think the -- I think we're in a 3% pricing world. And I think our volume has the potential to be a little stronger in the second half than the first half. So that -- what you're saying is kind of how we're thinking about it. We've been pretty conservative in our second half outlook. But if there was something that could exceed it, it will be the second half volume. Sales volume organically.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. Perfect. And then I wonder, just given the rise of med tech in the portfolio, if you could just give a general thought on your value add there. Is it different from anything in the core, general thoughts on core growth there. And then if the acquisition environment differs at all, if it's more white space, if it's more competing against others and deals? Just a couple of general thoughts there, if you would.
David Zapico: Yes, we've been acquired some good medical businesses. I mean as we go back and look the Rauland business has been a fabulous winner for us and that business is growing in the market. And we made an EMC acquisition, and that business has been very successful. And that business is in the similar market that Paragon that gave us confidence. And it's -- they're classic AMETEK businesses. We win in the market based on technology, based on engineering. They're a little more OEM than end market. But basically, our whole EMG business is more OEM than end market. You have longer looked at your customers in terms of what you're going to be building in the future. So it's a pretty stable market. And we just think the growth in the case of Paragon over the next 3 years will be a little bit slower to get down on that gate because of some of the things that are going on. But we're pretty confident it's going to be a low double-digit grower over the next few years. So we think with those portfolio additions, they're going to grow just a bit greater than the rate of our base portfolio.
Operator: Our next question is going to come from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Can you hear me? Hey, Bill, congratulations. Yes. So just a little bit more color. You -- I think other automation like short cycle companies expect second half rebound. Your comments sort of indicate something very similar. What kind of visibility do you have on that? And what gives you confidence that things are actually are going to turn in the second half? And I acknowledge that your view is very much consistent with what we hear from everybody else.
David Zapico: Yes. I think that in that second half for Automation, in particular, we're conservative on the input that we're getting from our customers in the marketplace. And I think that for the entire segment, we're forecasting it to be up low single digits. So we're not out. If we just put in there what our customers are telling us it would be higher. So we've been -- as a bit of conservative that we placed in it. And it's largely from talking to customers and understanding their inventory levels and it's the typical work that we do to set a plan for the year. And -- it's -- we think the -- we'll see a positive second half as those orders, those backlogs are depleted.
Andrew Obin: Excellent. And just maybe a follow-on building on that. You talked about sort of increasing investment, but are there business units that need to start expanding capacity, where are you broadly in capacity utilization? And finally, as you are expanding capacity, what are you going to do differently about your supply chain and where you are putting this capacity versus maybe pre-COVID?
David Zapico: Yes. I mean in terms of supply chain, we did a lot of work to eliminate the risks from China, and we did it actually before COVID. So we were well positioned during it. And I think the -- our supply chain is developing naturally around the different regions of the world and it's not as China-centric because of that. So that's 1 item. I think that in terms of capacity, we put significant capacity investments in over the past few years. We're a low CapEx business. And it's not -- we don't have to come to you and get away from our typical 2% of sales. We did it within our 2% of sales guideline. We put incremental capacity in our Mexican facilities. We put incremental capacity in our Malaysian facilities, we put incremental capacity in our Serbian facilities. So I think we're pretty -- we have an asset-light business model and we can usually ramp up pretty quickly, and we have the flexibility to reduce cost very quickly. So that's one of the advantages of the AMETEK model with our low CapEx environment. We can grow sales and adjust sales on the downside without big capacity investments without stringent investments when we downsize. So we're in excellent position to grow and we've done all that work over the past few years or so, I feel really confident that we're going to be able to keep up with the growth through the next growth cycle.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Brett Linzey of Mizuho.
Brett Linzey: Hey. Good morning, all. Congratulations to everyone. I wanted to come back to the pruning comment on Paragon. So you indicated you're running down some of the less profitable areas makes sense. I guess in the context of the broader portfolio, as you continue to shift towards this higher growth, higher-margin areas, is there more pruning to do on the other side in the context of the total AMETEK portfolio?
David Zapico: This printing process is something that we do with just about every new acquisition. So this is not new. And Paragon is a little bigger business and we're going to be careful with it. And but it's something that we do all the time. So all M&A deals will go through this process. Paragon is going to be going through in the first half. And we look at our own portfolio and we do that kind of thing all the time. So yes, it can continue, and we're pretty good at that portfolio rationalization things. Do you have another question, Brett?
Brett Linzey: Yes. And then just a second question on OpEx versus CapEx. I guess as you look at the customer spending environment for this year, and if you were to hone in on just those capital spending intensive businesses, have the planning assumptions or the tone changed in the last few months in that capital -- the capital spending type businesses at all?
David Zapico: In the U.S., there's a record number of projects from clean energy, power grid, semiconductor, they're just at a different level than they've been before. And a lot of that is from the government spending and backing. So that's largely continued. And at some point, it's going to provide an optimistic playing field for a lot of people in the industry. And I don't think we have that kind of upside built into our model right now, but it's -- there's planning going on with those projects right now. And that particular dynamic about the U.S. spending is driving the typical projects. So we're tracking to a very high number.
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Giordano at TD Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey guys. How are you doing? So a lot of companies are seeing -- have seen orders kind of decline organically for multiple quarters now. And predominantly, it's all attributed to inventory adjustment and supply chain. And Harvey, anyone has said anything about underlying conditions not being fine. So just curious if one, if you would agree with that. And two, if it worries you that everyone is seeing order declines and no one is saying anything is happening other than supply chain adjustments.
David Zapico: It really doesn't because it's 100-year pandemic. I mean you saw what happened. The supply chains were broken. People put inventory in place. And as I just got done talking to the last call, the project business is so strong. So we have a similar view. We're our businesses in health care, aerospace and defense, power and energy are performing well. They have a lot of projects. And we just think that we're going to work off the inventory and then they're going to be a return to more typical growth for the industrial market. I mean, at the end of the day, though, nobody knows. And if we run into a recession, we have good muscle member in that area. So we'll be able to react as we always react and we can run our business appropriately. And in fact, select businesses have already been doing that during '23 margins in our automation business, those people did a great job of removing excess costs from the business. So we're pretty good at reacting. But right now, we don't see that. We see the inventory being worked off, mainly in our OEM businesses and looking toward the future, we're optimistic with the number of new projects we have in the future.
Operator: Next question is going to come from Steve Bar with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Steve Barger: Hey, good morning. For the semi business, you mentioned your exposure to optics, which is great, but does that extend to advanced packaging applications, which are expected to show strong growth rates for the next couple of years? And if not, is getting specific exposure there? Something the team is looking at for M&A?
David Zapico: Yes. We have a little bit of exposure to advanced packaging, but it's spread across the business in different places, we're selling some components. So that's one of the items that our M&A teams are looking at, and we have exposure, but we'd like to have more.
Steve Barger: Okay. And then on the memory side, it seems like pricing is improving finally, and maybe fab utilization rates are starting to improve a bit. Is that translating into product inflection for you yet? Or is there still inventory that needs to be cleared on the memory side specifically?
David Zapico: Yes. I think that market on the memory side, that market is pretty much bottomed. So I don't think there's -- when that ticks up, there's going to be a -- I think that's immediately going to flow to the bottom line. I think the inventory there is mainly cleared out.
Operator: And our next question will be coming from Rob Mason of Baird.
Rob Mason: Yes. Good morning, and I’ll offer my congratulations as well, Bill. Dave, a lot of questions have been asked. I just circle back to the process business. You talked about that going to be up low single digits for the year. There's a lot in there from a business mix and market standpoint. Could you maybe speak to anything that could outperform that low single digits or anything that would stand out? And just for clarity, say what is the actual process industry exposure there now?
David Zapico: Yes. The process is a broader look at our process and analytical instruments business and the specific process industry would be more the process and analytical instruments business, which is a good part of it. And I think that what you're going to see there is our energy businesses are perhaps -- they grew nicely in Q4, and they have a good outlook for 2024. I think we sell a lot of business to Asia and China is a -- I told you we talked about it being flat. So that's something that we're concerned within the year for process. But as long as we keep developing state-of-the-art projects that are unmatched by our competitors, we're going to be fine in process. And as evidenced by our CAMECA, Zygo, broader UPT, broader MAD sales. So it's the research market. It's the optics market that are driving the business, and there are some medical applications in our rolling business that are in that segment. So there's a mix of different end market drivers. But when you look at the thing in total, we're calling it up low single digits this year. And again, the international parts of the business will be weaker than the U.S. parts.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you again, Tanya, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for the conference call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter, highlighted by outstanding operational execution, superb margin expansion, strong cash flows and earnings ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we established records for operating income, operating margins, earnings per share, EBITDA and cash flows. Given these strong results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have again, increased our earnings guidance for the full year. We have also been very active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of United Electronics Industries and subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Amplifier Research. Today, we also announced the signing of a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Paragon Medical, a highly attractive acquisition, which broadens our exposure in the Medical Technology space. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly. Now let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were $1.62 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was flat. Acquisitions added four points in the quarter and foreign currency added one point. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.96. We ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $3.4 billion, near record levels and down a modest 2% sequentially. Our backlog is up 5% from last year's third quarter and up 23% or $640 million from the end of 2021. AMETEK's operating performance in the third quarter was exceptional. Operating income in the quarter was a record $438 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2022. Operating margins were a record 27% in the quarter, up a sizable 220 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record at $511 million, up 10% over the prior year, with EBITDA margin, an impressive 31.5%. Operating cash flow was up 45% in the quarter to a record $473 million. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.64 per diluted share, up 13% versus the third quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.56 to $1.58. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered impressive operating performance, with continued strong and broad-based sales growth. Sales for EIG were $1.14 billion in the quarter, up 8% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 3.5%, acquisitions added 3.5% and foreign currency added a point. EIG's organic sales growth remains broad-based and reflects our leading position across attractive market segments and the impact of our organic growth initiatives. Growth in the quarter was particularly strong across our Aerospace & Defense businesses as well as in our Zygo, Spectro and CAMECA businesses. Third quarter operating income was a record $335 million, up 23% versus the prior year. And operating margins were a record 29.5% in the quarter, up an impressive 360 basis points from the prior year. Tremendous work by our EIG businesses in the third quarter. The Electromechanical Group also delivered solid operating performance in the quarter, despite the impact of normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base. EMG's third quarter sales were $487 million, down 2% versus the prior year, with organic sales down 8% in the quarter. Acquisitions added four points and foreign currency added two points. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $128 million, down 7% compared to the prior year period, while EMG's third quarter operating margins were a very solid 26.2%. Our performance in the third quarter and thus far in 2023, reflects the unique value inherent in the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated businesses are aligned with diverse and attractive growth markets, while our organic growth initiatives continue to position us for long-term sustainable growth. Our distributed operating structure provides our businesses with the ability to execute their growth strategy and the flexibility to react quickly to changing market conditions. And our asset-light business model and strong operational execution drive outstanding cash flow generation, which we redeploy on value-enhancing acquisitions. This strong cash flow and our robust balance sheet are key differentiators for AMETEK in this higher interest rate environment. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. As noted, we have been very active in managing a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We are pleased to welcome our most recent acquisitions, United Electronic Industries and Amplifier Research. I'm pleased that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Paragon Medical. I will provide some more color on each of these businesses, starting with Paragon Medical. Paragon Medical is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered medical components and instruments serving applications, including orthopedics, minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery and drug delivery solutions. Paragon's broad product portfolio of single-use and implantable components are sold to a diverse blue-chip customer base of leading medical device OEMs. Paragon is an excellent acquisition for AMETEK. It expands our presence in the med tech space and provides us with access to attractive new market segments with strong growth rates. We are acquiring Paragon in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.9 billion. Paragon has annual sales of approximately $500 million and is headquartered in Pierceton, Indiana. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. Now switching to United Electronic Industries, or UEI, which we acquired in August. UEI is a leading provider of ruggedized test, measurement, simulation and control solutions. UEI's custom products cater to diverse data acquisition needs from hardware in the loop testing, to aircraft simulators and automated testing systems and mission-critical applications. With a strong presence in the defense, aerospace nuclear power generation and semiconductor, UEI nicely complements AMETEK's Power Systems and Instruments division, significantly expanding our data acquisition capabilities. UEI has annual sales of approximately $35 million and is based in Norwood, Massachusetts. Next, Amplifier Research is a leading provider of innovative RF and microwave solutions. Its equipment is used for electromagnetic compatibility testing within the defense, industrial, automotive, medical and communication sectors. Amplifier Research is an outstanding strategic acquisition and complementary fit with our existing compliance test solutions business. Their technical capability has broaden our RF instrumentation and testing portfolio. Amplifier Research is a growing business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for electric vehicle research, development and testing. Amplifier Research is based in Souderton, PA and has annual sales of approximately $60 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains very solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital in the coming quarters.  AMETEK also remains committed to investing in our businesses to help position them for long-term sustainable organic growth. In 2023, we plan to invest approximately $100 million in these growth initiatives, including our new product development efforts where our businesses continue to develop highly differentiated technologies to help solve our customers' most complex challenges. In the quarter, our vitality index, which measures sales from products introduced over the prior three years, was a healthy 26%. As a complement to our internal new product development efforts, our ORTEC business recently acquired a Small Technology company, innoRIID, to help broaden their technology capabilities in the Radiation Detection market. InnoRIID, both cutting-edge technology expertise and an exceptional product development team, known for their innovative solutions having developed specialized Artificial Intelligence algorithms, for radiation detection in a range of Nuclear Security, Research, Health and Medical Applications. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year, with strong performance in the third quarter and a positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are, once again, raising our earnings guidance. For the full year, we continue to expect overall sales to be up mid-to-high single-digits, and we continue to expect organic sales to be up mid-single-digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.31 to $6.33, up approximately 11% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $6.18 to $6.26 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single-digits, with adjusted earnings of $1.61 to $1.63 per share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's third quarter results for 2023 were outstanding, with strong growth across our long-cycle businesses, record operating performance and strong acquisition activity. Our businesses continue to excel, driven by our differentiated technology solutions serving diverse and growing markets. Our asset-light business model and strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to navigate challenging economic environments, while actively deploying capital to enhance shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned for long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter, with exceptional operating performance, robust margin expansion and strong cash flows. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million essentially unchanged from the prior year, and as a percentage of sales, were 1.5% versus 1.6% in last year's third quarter. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's G&A to sales level. Other income and expense was a headwind of $9 million in the quarter, due largely to lower pension income and higher due diligence costs. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.7%, down from 19% in the third quarter of 2022, due to improved utilization of tax credits. For 2023, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19%. And as we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $29 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $145 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $330 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million or $0.68 per share. Operating working capital in the third quarter was 19.1% of sales. Cash flow was excellent in the quarter with outstanding growth versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was a record $473 million, up 45% versus the third quarter of 2022, while free cash flow was also a record at $444 million, up 49% over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 131% in the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect approximately 120% free cash flow to net income conversion. Total debt at September 30 was $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $842 million. At the end of the third quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.6 times, leaving us with significant available cash and financial capacity to deploy on strategic acquisitions. As Dave has noted, we've been very active. During the third quarter, we deployed approximately $150 million on the acquisitions of UEI and innoRIID. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $105 million on the acquisition of Amplifier Research. Also subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Paragon Medical for $1.9 billion, which would be our largest acquisition to-date. Following the acquisition of Paragon, we would still have significant financial capacity with approximately $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities available to support our growth initiatives. In summary, AMETEK had exceptional results in the third quarter. We achieved significant margin expansion and delivered high-quality earnings. Our strong position in key market segments, coupled with a very strong backlog and exceptional operating capabilities, positions us well for continued success. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Abigail, could we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, congrats on all the M&A successes here. Maybe we can start with Paragon. It looks right in your wheelhouse, precision medical robotics. If you could provide some color on the company in terms of like what percent are consumables? We're really like seeing all those one use applications. So consumables, comment on margins and growth, if you could, please?
Dave Zapico: Yes. Sure. I'll give you my view of Paragon. As you stated, the leading provider of highly engineered medical components and instruments. When you look at the key market drivers of this acquisition, you have the aging population, the demographic shifts, you also have procedure innovation, where the minimally invasive procedures are becoming more percentages of surgeries, and they do a great job with that. And also in this market, there's a continuing trend toward outsourcing the OEMs. And they want to -- the OEMs want to accelerate their time to market, and Paragon is really well positioned with significant new product wins in this space. It serves specialty applications. I talked about the orthopedics, minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery and drug delivery. Orthopedics is the largest, but they're strong positions in each of the applications. Now, the portfolio is one of your questions, consisted of single-use and consumable surgical instruments and implantable components, and about 40% of the business is recurring in nature. So the single-use and consumables surgical instruments are about 40% of the revenue. So we really like that. As a blue-chip customer base, over 600 programs, with diverse sources of revenue, about 85% of the business is on sole-source programs. It's a very, very sticky business. When you combine the regulatory environment with lengthy approval processes and the capabilities of Paragon, there's high switching costs. It's a business that has unique value to its customer base. We did a lot of surveys in the market, and they're the highest quality provider. They have excellent customer service. A differentiator for them is their design and development capability. And I really considered a true partner by their customers. And when I look at this from -- that's about Paragon, when I look at what it does for AMETEK, it increases our med tech exposure now to over 20%. It's one of the goals we've been trying to achieve. It adds about $500 million in revenue to EMG, and that revenue is -- comes from Paragon, which is a secular low double-digit grower. It really fits our business model with the highly engineered products that provide unique value to customers. It's a growing, profitable business that provides multiple avenues of growth. And there's really an opportunity for us to improve margins by applying the AMETEK growth model. It's already a profitable business, but there's plenty of room for us to apply the AMETEK growth model and expand margins. Paragon will benefit from the AMETEK's global infrastructure for sure, and we like the management team. They're highly talented team, and we're excited about what we can accomplish together. And importantly, the deal economics meant AMETEK's traditional dealers, and this is on a large deployment of capital. So, our return on invested capital orders are met by this deal. And we paid about 15 times TTM EBITDA for the business. So we're very excited for the business. It's a good business for us. We've been looking at these businesses for some time and a universal excitement amongst Paragon and AMETEK.
Deane Dray: All right. That was a great overview, and you hit all the key questions on the consumables, margins and growth. So it sounds like a great story. And if I could just -- on a follow-up question on EMG. So we're seeing destocking all over the sector in biopharma and med tech. Be interested in hearing from you, besides the destocking, is there any kind of read-through on the end markets in those businesses? Are you seeing any slowing there? And look, no one's getting -- no one has a crystal ball here in terms of how long you think this lasts, but I'd love to hear your expectation on the duration of this inventory normalization. Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Yes. Sure, Deane, great questions. For the quarter, we grew our top line 5% on a mid-single-digit guide. Our revenue was in line with the guide. The acquisition performed a bit better. And we maintained, as I said, our full year sales guide mid-to-high single-digits and organic growth of mid-single-digits. To maintain that organic guide for the full year, our Aerospace and Defense business is stronger and our automation is weaker. And they're offsetting. That's one of the benefits of the AMETEK portfolio. And specifically in terms of Q3 revenue, we saw faster destocking in our automation businesses than we anticipated. So that's what we saw there. And we expect the destocking to continue through the end of the year. In terms of your question is, is it a, destock or a downturn? It's very difficult dynamic environment right now and lots of uncertainties, with the geopolitical risk, the interest rate increases. They're factoring in, for sure. But from what we see, this is largely an inventory correction. And demand looks constructive, with many new projects in the offing and the projects are not being delayed or canceled. Our Aerospace and Defense looks solid. Our Medical looks solid, significant projects and semiconductor, clean energy, power grid. So we remain positive post-destocking. And we think that destocking will continue through the end of the year. And in terms of 2024, we're going to sit down with our teams and understand what's going on. But in general, we're constructive.
Deane Dray: That's all really helpful. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Hi, Matt.
Matt Summerville: Dave, your EIG margin this quarter really moved into a new ZIP code for AMETEK. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the key drivers as you just think about the sequential performance, right, Rev flat, profitability up $28 million on the OP line as well as kind of the year-over-year dynamics, so maybe if you can just kind of flesh all of that out, that would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up.
Dave Zapico: Yes. Sure, Matt. I mean if you'll go back and look at my last quarter or two, I told you EIG, was gaining momentum, and the momentum certainly showed up in Q3. We had an excellent operating quarter. I mean EIG margins were up 360 basis points, driven by high contribution leverage on the growth. We really had excellent price cost. We had strongly performing acquisitions and it all came together to put up record margins.
Matt Summerville: And then, just as a follow-up. With respect to Paragon, I appreciate the stats you shared. Is there any way to kind of parse out what you think year one cash EPS accretion would look like? And then what the expected closure timing might be for that? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Great questions, Matt. We think the closure -- it's dependent on regulatory approval, but nothing atypical. But we think -- we'll get the approvals and close sometime in the first quarter. In terms of year one, yes, we'll have a very modest cash EPS accretion. It's going to be impacted by purchase accounting, integration costs, realignment cost to financing costs, we'll pay with this with a mix of cash and debt. And -- but we'll have very strong accretion in year two. And we're excited about getting the business under our wing, improving the business and delivering and we're very excited.
Matt Summerville: Just real quick, Dave. So you're not planning to non-GAAP those items out, you're just going to run them through the P&L then?
Dave Zapico: We'll make that decision at the time. Historically, we have not broken them out, but with the amount of acquisition activity that we have. It may make sense to do that. We haven't made a decision yet.
Matt Summerville: Got it. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Allison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. 
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: Just want to go back to your comments on automation. If I recall, that's typically a canary in the coal mine. But it seems from your comments what I'm reading through, I just want to clarify that it just seems to be more industry destocking for you in that market? Or was it something that -- I want to make sure I understand.
Dave Zapico: Yes. We think it's destocking. We think it's destocking. And the destocking last through the year-end. And -- but post destocking, we remain constructive. We are -- that business automation sells to a lot of markets and the health care part of that market is not doing well right now and some of the other exposures, but we think it's clearly destocking.
Allison Poliniak: Got it. And then on growth investments, keeping to the $100 million, how should we be thinking about into 2024? Is it something that you think there could be a raise there? And then just even with Paragon, what that R&D? I think you talked about the design piece of it being very -- a big part of that, how does design in R&D? Is it higher than the typical AMETEK? How should we be thinking about?
Dave Zapico: I think you should think about Paragon is matching the AMETEK profile.
Allison Poliniak: Got it. And then organic investments as we kind of look to 2024 is...
Dave Zapico: Yes. I mean we're going to sit down with each of our teams, discuss 2024 over the next six weeks. We're going to review each of the individual businesses. We do deep dives, as you know, into what they are seeing in their niches, their market dynamics, growth opportunities, cost reduction opportunities, and we want to go through that -- these meetings before there's any commentary in 2024. We'll tell you in early February. But -- so in terms of talking about next year, we'll have the typical things like we expect price to offset inflation and CapEx will be about 2% of sales and things like that. But we're going to defer from talking about the overall plan until we get to meet with our teams and understand at a detailed level.
Allison Poliniak: Perfect. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Allison.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Sprague: Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague: Good morning, Dave. Just to come back to Paragon, maybe one more time. Maybe somebody else will come at it again. I just kind of want to understand the -- maybe the profit improvement plan going forward. Because it looks like rough math right, margins, EBITDA margin is 25% or so. You're doing 800 to 1,000 bps better now than that in EIG. When you talk about kind of the aspirations for the business and the cost cutting and other opportunities, is that the sort of Zip code and margin improvement we should be thinking about here? And if so, over kind of how long a period of time?
Dave Zapico: Yes. That is the Zip code and it's over time. And we're going to build a plan with the management team and show them all the resources that AMETEK has and some of our business processes. But what you're talking about is in the Zip code of what we have planned.
Jeffrey Sprague: And just to elaborate a little bit more on how this fits. Is there a kind of a commercial or operational synergy with other parts of the business? Or should we just think of this as an interesting, healthy kind of stand-alone business that drops into the portfolio?
Dave Zapico: We have an existing business in our EMG business. It's about a $200 million business. It's -- or called our engineered medical components. So we're familiar with these segments. There's completely different end markets, but think about that as additive to that existing position, but in a greater scale.
Jeffrey Sprague: And then maybe just one last one from me. The med tech world has been a little rocky here the last couple of years, procedures post-COVID everything. You characterized it as a double-digit secular grower. But are they kind of sitting in a little bit of a trough here impacted by those sorts of forces? Or maybe just kind of the...
Dave Zapico: Not really. They're growing nicely. I mean you have the market growth that they're benefiting from, and they happen to be in the fastest areas. They've deployed their resources well and they're benefiting from the faster fastest growth areas. The -- there's -- they're winning new business on new programs, it's pretty substantial. And we did surveys on these businesses, and this is a really good business in terms of their capability and how they take care of their customers, and they're definitely winning share. So, it's going to be a low double-digit grower for the next few years, and a lot of that's programmed in. Now that's the way we're looking at. There's going to be ups and downs as we go throughout the years, but this is a solid business with really good growth prospects.
Jeffrey Sprague: Great. Congrats and good luck with it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open 
Scott Graham: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking minute here. Nice quarter.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Scott. Thank you.
Scott Graham: You just -- a couple ideas filled what was the working capital percent last year?
William Burke: Give me one second on that.
Scott Graham: Sure. Sure. I'll just -- I'll ask another one.
William Burke: I got it. It was 18.4.
Scott Graham: 18.4. Okay. Thanks. And then the $1.5 billion of availability, just maybe walk us through there. That is net of Paragon, I assume? And is that like an assumption at about 2.5 times leverage?
William Burke: No, that's the amount of cash and availability under our revolver post-Paragon. The leverage post-Paragon would only be about 1.5 times EBITDA at the gross level. So substantial …
Scott Graham: Okay.
WilliamBurke: --financial flexibility as well as we're still well under-levered I would say. And as Dave has talked about, lots of other opportunities available to us as we look to continue the acquisition strategy. So again, it's always finding the right businesses for the AMETEK portfolio. It is not capital constrained.
Scott Graham: Right. Right. Yes, that's how you do that as well.
Dave Zapico: Other way to make that--
Scott Graham: I guess--
Dave Zapico: Other way to make that--
Scott Graham: Sure.
Dave Zapico: Other way to make that, as Bill said, post-Paragon, we have 1.5 leverage, we wanted to take at up to 2.5 leverage, which is we've been there before, and that's not a high number for all. We can spend $2.6 billion on acquisitions, above and beyond Paragon. So we're in the M&A game, and our pipeline looks really good. And we have the balance sheet to be able to execute on it and the capability to integrate these businesses.
Scott Graham: Thank you for that. I appreciate it. When you are looking at deals these days in this interest rate environment, you're obviously funding them off of a lot of balance sheet liquidity and admittedly, maybe now higher rates off of the revolver. But are you impute an interest rate that is kind of more market-oriented when you make these decisions?
Dave Zapico: Yes. Our models use current borrowing rates as part of that decision-making process.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you. Last question is the typical one, Dave, would you mind kind of maybe unbundling on the four divisions?
Dave Zapico: Sure, Scott, I'll walk around the business. I'll start with our Process business. And -- overall, sales for Process were up mid-single-digits, at low single-digit organic sales and the contribution from the acquisition of Navitar. And demand across our Process markets remains solid. Our products and technologies are well aligned with important secular growth trends like the energy transition and health care. Growth in the quarter was strongest across these end-markets, while our high-end optics business in Zygo continues to perform very well, with strong demand for our custom optical solutions. And for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Process businesses. Going to Aerospace & Defense Next. Aerospace & Defense continues to perform well. Organic sales were up low-double digits in the quarter. Growth remains strong and broad-based across our A&D sub-segments. Our growth in the quarter was strongest in our defense businesses, while commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses also grew at healthy levels. Given this strong performance, we now expect sales for Aerospace & Defense to increase mid-teens, on a percentage basis for the full year. In Power & Industrial, those businesses delivered solid results in the third quarter, with overall sales up mid-teens. This growth was driven by a low single-digit organic sales growth and the contribution from the acquisition of RTDS technologies. We saw the strongest growth in the quarter across our renewable Energy and Power Simulation businesses, including RTDS. Our Power businesses are well positioned to benefit from long-term investments required to modernize the electric power grid and build-out of the renewable energy infrastructure globally. And for all of 2023, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Power business. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. Overall sales for AE&S, were down mid-single-digits in the quarter, with contributions from the acquisition of Bison Engineering, being more than offset by a low double-digit decrease in organic sales. As we expected, the impact from normalization of inventory levels, which we talked about earlier, across our OEM customer base, combined with the challenging prior year comparisons, created a short-term headwind for our OEM exposed businesses. We believe underlying demand is solid. As we talked about earlier, and across our diverse Automation & Engineered Solutions markets, we remain constructive. But we do expect, as we said before, the inventory normalization is going to recur throughout the OEM customer base will continue through the end of the year. And now for the full year, we expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be down mid-single-digits versus the prior year. So that's all for the subsegment commentary here, Scott.
Scott Graham: Thanks very much. 
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the deal, deals even. Okay. So good morning. Can you hear me?
Dave Zapico: Yes. We can hear you Nigel.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Good. I couldn't hear you. Okay. So maybe you could do the same process geographically, talk about what you're seeing by geography. I'd be curious about Europe and China. And also, you gave some perspective on business performance. Maybe you could talk about -- maybe just for a final point on 4Q, maybe talk about core growth and acquisition and contribution for 4Q?
Dave Zapico: Okay. Q4 and geography. Okay. I'll go across the geographies. We had continued solid growth in the US, with the international slowing a bit. So I'll unpack that a bit. The US was up mid-single-digits, with notable strength in our process business. Europe was down low single-digits, notable strength in process and our aerospace business, but weakness in automation. You mentioned China. Our China exposure was down 3%. Strong growth in process weakness in automation. And overall, Asia was down about 10%. So China did better than overall Asia, kind of about 9% of sales. So again, up in the US, slowing in international markets. And the second question you asked was on Q4 and the guide for Q4. And our sales will be up mid-single-digits. We'll grow in revenue. There are two factors impacting the earnings in Q4. One of them is a higher tax rate. And the second one is there's some acquisition, integration costs and they're related to the deals we completed. But we're very confident in our guide for Q4.
Nigel Coe: I'm sorry, David, what is the core growth for 4Q?
Dave Zapico: Core growth for Q4 was low to mid-single-digits.
Nigel Coe: Okay. So that's obviously acceleration from 3Q. What's driving that acceleration?
Dave Zapico: I think we're seeing some good demand on the EIG side from the typical year-end selling -- year-end sales that we typically get of capital spending, plus the EIG business is performing well. So our aerospace and our process businesses are performing well, and that's what driving the organic sales in Q4 to be higher than the organic sales in Q3.
Nigel Coe: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just one more for me. So obviously, Paragon, big deal. You've posed another smaller deal. You sound really bullish on the outlook as well. So it seems like the cut line is still pretty fertile. I mean are we seeing here a change in behavior from sellers that we see more willing sellers? Are we seeing any change in sort of multiples here? Any color on the market would be helpful.
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think it's a little choppy in the market and people are reevaluating. And the interest rates are higher. So financing that debt on a continuing organization may be a challenge. And as I said, in the beginning of the year, our pipeline is strong. I would categorize our pipeline right now is very strong. We have a lot of attractive candidates we're looking at. And I'm just bullish on being able to differentiate AMETEK's performance over the next 12 to 24 months with our OpEx and our M&A.
Nigel Coe: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open 
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning. 
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn: I want to keep it going on Paragon a little bit. I think you listed as -- for medical components and instruments. I'm wondering if it is the OEM and some of the instrument spaces? And also a little bit on ownership history and the deal process competitiveness and such.
Dave Zapico: Yes. When you think about Paragon, they're largely selling to an OEM customer base, but they do sell some of their surgical instruments directly to the end customer, but it's largely an OEM customer base. We purchased the business from American Securities. And from our view, they did an excellent job running the business and got a fantastic management team in place, a good growth strategy. And they're -- what they did is really position kind of a pure med tech play, by positioning this with some other parts of their portfolio. So we're pretty excited about what we're buying.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks for the added color.
Dave Zapico: Yes. Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Mizuho. Your line is open 
Peter Costa: Good morning, everyone. This is Peter as on for Brett Linzey. So just coming back to orders. Could you provide some context during the monthly order cadence through the quarter and then moving into October? Have you been seeing anything concerning or anything tracking better than your internal expectations? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: No, I think the quarterly evolution of orders is about what we see. We mentioned our book-to-bill and things like that. And we started out in Q4 in line with what we need to deliver those results. So we had talked -- in our last few earnings calls, we highlighted a couple of dynamics that would impact orders. And our orders have been very strong for an extended period of time. In fact, we averaged 18% organic growth in 2021 and 2022. And we had 12 consecutive quarters up to this quarter with positive book-to-bill. So as a result, we have a near record backlog. As we said, these dynamics are playing out as we anticipated.
Peter Costa: Perfect. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: Hi. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Wondering, if you've seen …
Dave Zapico: Good morning, David.
David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. Wondering, if you've seen any impact from the higher interest rates on end market demand? And in particular, some of the other publicly traded test and measurement companies have mentioned project delays, particularly in China, have you seen anything along those lines?
Dave Zapico: Yes. As I mentioned, we were down about 3% organically in China, so there was some delays, but it wasn't substantial. In terms of increasing interest rates, that's one of the uncertainties that we're clearly looking at. And it's a very dynamic environment right now. And there are factors for sure, but we're not seeing an impact on projects, proceeding or anything like that from the interest rates at this point.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And are you supply chain constrained at this point in your Aerospace and Defense businesses? Is that a sort of a limiter on growth accelerating and even greater overtime?
Dave Zapico: We are not supply chain limited in Aerospace at this time. Now the industry is dealing with some supply chain difficulties, but we're not limited.
David Ridley-Lane: All right. Thank you very much.
Dave Zapico: Next?
Operator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Anastasiou with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Michael Anastasiou: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Michael.
WilliamBurke: Good morning, Michael.
Michael Anastasiou: Back to Paragon, currently, medical-related revenues are about, give or take, 10% of sales. And after this acquisition, it takes you to about 20%. So was just expecting -- just curious if you're expecting to make like a deeper push into medical moving forward? And then what is sort of like the best way to think about balancing M&A dollars for these different end markets as well? Any color would be helpful.
Dave Zapico: Yes. There's a balance in AMETEK's end markets. And we really like that balance. That's why we're able to navigate some of the challenges that we're going through right now. So it's -- we plan on keeping that balance. But if there are other attractive areas in the medical space, we'll certainly look at them. But it's -- we like the balance in the portfolio. And what was your other question, Michael? M&A dollars. I mean we have a distributed operating model. In all of our businesses, we have management teams there that are doing strategy work around their businesses and trying to make their businesses better, and they're bringing forward acquisition candidates. So we don't have a predefined number of -- predefined amount of capital that we're going to apply to certain markets. We're going to be looking for the deal, the deal quality, the quality of the businesses and if we have the management teams to integrate them. So we have a different viewpoint. We don't look at it from the top down in terms of dollars allocated per market.
Michael Anastasiou: Got you. That's helpful. And just kind of diving back into it. So potentially, depending on availability of assets and not such, do you expect total revenues to the medical end market increasing over time? And how do you expect that?
Dave Zapico: Yes. It's 20% now. It could go 25%, 30%. That wouldn't bother us, but we plan on having a diversified revenue base.
Michael Anastasiou: Great. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Abigail, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our conference call. As a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AMETEK Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Kevin Coleman: Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties and that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2022 or 2023 results or to 2023 guidance will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. AMETEK achieved exceptional performance in the second quarter, marked by strong sales growth, outstanding operational execution and record results ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income, operating margins, earnings per share and EBITDA. We also ended the quarter with a record backlog. AMETEK's continued outstanding results reflect the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our niche differentiated businesses. The benefits from our organic growth initiatives and, most importantly, the outstanding efforts from our dedicated colleagues. Considering our strong second quarter results and the positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were $1.65 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was 5%. Acquisitions added 4 points in the quarter and foreign currency was flat. Our book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter was 1.01, our 12th consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. As a result, we ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.44 billion up $220 million from the end of 2022 and up $1.6 billion or 91% from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was a record $419 million. A 15% increase over the second quarter of 2022. Operating margins were 25.4% in the quarter, up an impressive 130 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $496 million, up 12% over the prior year, while EBITDA margins were also impressive at 30.1%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.57 per diluted share, up 14% versus the second quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.49 to $1.51 per share. Now let me provide some additional details of the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group had a great quarter with excellent sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG were $1.13 billion in the quarter, up 10% from the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were up a very strong 8% with acquisitions accounting for the balance of the growth. EIG sales growth in the second quarter was widespread across each of our divisions, with growth particularly strong in our Aerospace and Defense and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses. EIG's operating performance was impressive with strong profit growth and margin expansion. Operating income was $307 million up 16% versus the prior year, while operating margins were 27.1%, up a robust 130 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $511 million up 5% versus the prior year, driven by the acquisition of Bison Engineering, with organic sales roughly flat in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $136 million up 10% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second quarter operating margins were excellent at 26.6%, up 100 basis points versus the prior year. While EMG's core operating margins was exclude acquisition dilution, we're up a sizable 180 basis points. Overall, AMETEK achieved outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, AMETEK's continued strong operating execution -- our strong results speak to the attractiveness and diversity of the end markets we serve. Our businesses hold leading positions in attractive niche market segments. Through our continued organic growth investments and strategic acquisitions, we are expanding our presence in market segments and niches aligned with strong secular growth drivers. As a result, our businesses are well positioned with differentiated solutions, to benefit from the meaningful and long-term investments in areas such as electrification, clean energy, health care efficiency and manufacturing reinsuring. In addition to our alignment with strong growth markets, AMETEK has seen great success from our organic growth initiatives and investments. For all of 2023, we expect to spend over $100 million on incremental growth investments. These investments are largely focused on expanding our sales, marketing and commercial excellence initiatives as well as broadening our research, development and engineering efforts. AMETEK's research development and engineering teams across our businesses consistently deliver innovative and next-generation products tailored to meet the unique needs of our customers. While there are numerous examples across the company, I wanted to highlight our Abaco business unit for their outstanding accomplishments. Abaco is a leading provider of commercial off-the-shelf embedded computing systems for aerospace, defense and specialized industrial applications. Demand for Abaco solutions remains strong, given the position as a leading provider of ruggedized technology solutions with advanced thermal management capabilities. Abaco was awarded the best overall design for high-performance PCBAs at the recent Accelerator Technology Innovation Awards. Abaco also recently introduced a next-generation integrated computing and graphics car with the latest GPU technology. This provides our customers with advanced computing graphics processing and security capabilities required in AI-focused applications such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, radar signal processing and deep machine learning for autonomous systems. In addition to Abaco, many other businesses are well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for high computing power and analytics. We recognize the pivotal role of organic growth initiatives and driving our overall growth strategy. These investments in organic growth, coupled with our market leadership and attractive market exposures position the company for continued success in driving sustainable long-term growth. Now switching to our capital deployment and acquisition strategy. Over the last three quarters, we deployed approximately $530 million on the acquisition of three businesses: Navitar, RTDS and Bison Engineering. Each of these businesses is integrating nicely into AMETEK and each is very well positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities in their markets. Our acquisition pipeline remains very strong and our businesses and internal M&A teams are actively managing a number of opportunities. AMETEK remains committed to leveraging our strong cash flow to pursue strategic acquisitions that align with our growth objectives. With a robust balance sheet and significant financial capacity, we are well positioned to support our acquisition strategy and capitalize on value-creating opportunities in the future. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment continue to warrant caution in the short term, we are confident in our ability to navigate through these challenges and deliver strong results. Building upon our strong first half results and positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up mid- to high single digits with organic sales expected to be up mid-single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.18 to $6.26, up 9% to 10% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.96 to $6.10 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with adjusted earnings of $1.56 to $1.58 per share, up 8% to 9% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses continued to deliver excellent performance, benefiting from differentiated technology solutions that cater to diverse and growing niche markets. The implementation of our organic growth initiatives has yielded higher levels of growth, while our portfolio remains aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets. Our asset-light business model and strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to navigate challenging, environments while actively deploying capital to drive increased shareholder value. As a result, AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong second quarter with record level operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.5 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year and as a percentage of sales were 1.5% versus 1.6% in last year's second quarter. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's G&A to sales level. Second quarter other income and expense was a $6 million headwind versus the prior period due largely to lower pension income in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.2%, down slightly from the 18.5% in the second quarter of 2022. For 2023, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $28 million and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $145 million for the full year or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $335 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million or $0.68 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the second quarter was 19% of sales. Cash flow in the quarter was up meaningfully from the prior year. Operating cash flow was $335 million, up 42% from the prior year and free cash flow was $307 million, up 47% from the second quarter of 2022. Free cash flow conversion was 95% in the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect approximately 120% free cash flow to net income conversion. Total debt at June 30 was $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $606 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses continue to deliver exceptional results in the second quarter of 2023. We delivered strong sales growth, achieved robust margin expansion and a high quality of earnings. Our leading positions across attractive market segments, record backlog and outstanding operating capabilities have positioned us well for continued success in the back half of the year. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Benny, can we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: All right, sure. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Could you maybe talk to about, obviously, book-to-bill being positive is very strong outcome here just given some of the uncertainties -- but could you maybe talk to order trends that you're seeing since then? Anything concerning I know you talked about sort of you've been to looks more in the longer term but any short-term kind of headwinds that you're starting to see there?
Dave Zapico: Great question. The overall demand environment still feels solid. We had the 12th straight quarter of positive book-to-bill and ended with an all-time record of $3.44 billion. So our book-to-bill was 1.01 and it was positive in both groups; so that's really great. Our backlog is over 50% of our annual sales and well above normal historical levels. So normal historical level of about 30%. So we're in a strong position as we proceed throughout 2023. If you recall in the last couple of earnings calls, we highlighted a couple of dynamics that would impact order growth. The first are difficult comparisons. If you look at our -- over an extended period of time, in fact, in all 2021 and '22, we averaged 18% organic growth. So we have some difficult comps that we're running up against. And the second dynamic we highlighted, is our expectation to return to more normalized ordering patterns. We had a situation where customers were ordering early and now that the supply chain is improving and getting back to normal, lead times are getting back to normal or seeing this dynamic play out. But we're well positioned to deal with it and our record backlog and positive book-to-bill give us confidence for the remainder of the year.
Allison Poliniak: And leverage, clearly low here. You talked about a pipeline pretty active. Can you maybe give us some color on sort of what's been holding it back? Is it still in terms of executing, is it still, I would say, valuations at this point? You're just not seeing anything of great interest. Just any color there would be helpful.
Dave Zapico: Yes. Our pipeline remains very strong and we're actively looking at a number of high-quality deals across a broad set of our markets. And as always, we will remain disciplined. So the discipline is in full force but we expect it to be active in the back half of the year. And more broadly, over the next couple of years, we really have the opportunity to differentiate our performance with the M&A aspect of our growth strategy. We're very well positioned with a strong balance sheet and we're really working hard at it and sometimes you can't predict what quarter they're going to close on or what quarters are going to happen but the backlog is at an elevated -- that backlog of deals at an elevated level and we are extremely busy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson & Company.
Matt Summerville: David, could you maybe just go ahead and do the kind of around the horn, if you will, with respect to the businesses, the divisions, what you saw in Q2 and how that informs your organic expectations for those areas for the balance of the year?
Dave Zapico: I'd be glad to, Matt. I'll start with our largest market segment, our process segment and overall sales for our Process businesses, were up high single digits in the quarter and that included mid-single-digit organic growth and contributions from the recent acquisition of Navitar. Growth remains solid across each of our process divisions with -- as mentioned in the prepared remarks, our Ultra Precision Technologies business delivered notably strong growth and driven by high-end optics and metrology businesses. We also grew solid growth across our med tech businesses and the Rauland business that we mentioned a couple of quarters ago continues to perform extremely well. So for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth for the Process businesses, very solid. Aerospace and Defense. The growth remains very strong across our aerospace and defense businesses. In the quarter, both overall and organic sales were up low double digits on a percentage basis. And it really was reflective of strong performance in all of the subsegments in A&D. Growth was particularly strong across our aftermarket businesses as air travel returns to pre-pandemic levels, driving very strong demand for MRO products and services. And given the strong growth in the quarter, we now expect sales for the full year to increase low double digits on a percentage basis versus 2022. So we increased our outlook for our Aerospace and Defense businesses. Moving to Power & Industrial, overall sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the second quarter. And that was really fueled by mid-single-digit organic sales growth and the contributions from the RTDS acquisition which has performed extremely well. Organic growth in the quarter was strongest in our power test and measurement business, programmable power. And for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Power and Industrial businesses. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Overall sales were up mid-single digits, with mid-single-digit decline in organic sales being offset by the contributions from the Bison acquisition. And as we noted previously and in my question to Allison, I talked about normalization of inventory levels is continuing across our OEM businesses and the impact is most significant in our automation business. For the full year, we now expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions business to be up low single digits with stronger growth expected across our EMIP businesses. That's across the -- around the horn on that.
Matt Summerville: And then maybe just to your last point, can you maybe comment on how long this normalization -- this normalization period, you feel may last with respect to automation. And then if you could maybe just to switch gears a little bit, give a little bit of geographic color in terms of what you're seeing, both organically and from an incoming order rate standpoint.
Dave Zapico: Yes, I'd be glad to. In terms of the automation business, I think it's going to last a couple of quarters. It's probably going to bottom near the end of this year. And what we have there is the end markets for automation are very interesting. The places where the inventory correction is steepest, as with our medical technology customers, with our life science customers. We have been positioned on a lot of COVID test equipment. Also our semiconductors, especially in the memory area is weak right now. So the -- that is correcting and it's going to correct in the second half. But I really think what the end markets that business serves is coiled the response. So in an upward fashion. So we kind of saw this coming. It's impacting OEM businesses but very significantly in our automation business but we're positioned well to manage through that, increase our guidance and because we're really operating well. Our productivity programs are progressing nicely. As I mentioned, the recent acquisitions are performing very well. Price inflation, we have good visibility and the A&D business is accelerating. It's our highest margin segment. Now moving on to your next question. I really feel good about the geographical story around AMETEK too. We saw a strong broad-based growth across all segments. The U.S. was up mid-single digits. We had broad-based strength -- notable strength in our process and aerospace and defense businesses. Europe was up high single digits, really, really positive performance there with notable strength in our process and power businesses. And Asia was up with 3 points with notable strength in process.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: First, I got to start with the shout-out complement for that one pager in your website that gives you the quarter recap and backlog and free cash flow. I don't know, I didn't see the timing in the first quarter but we really appreciate having that up on the website; so, thank you. Listen, a lot of good questions. We've gone through already. Just on this normalization and we're seeing that everywhere and it seems to be not very disruptive for you all. Is there an opportunity? Maybe this is for Bill, would you be releasing any buffer inventory as things start to normalize, you go from just in case a bit closer to just in time. Is that an opportunity?
William Burke: Absolutely and that's something our businesses are very much focused on. We did all the right things to work our way through the supply chain, protect our customers given our extensive backlogs. But as that starts to normalize, our businesses are pivoting now to reducing inventories. And I think you'll see that happen as we move through the second half of the year.
Deane Dray: Good. That was the timing we were looking for. And maybe some commentary on price cost, any kind of pricing carryover benefit and contribution from new products in the quarter?
Dave Zapico: Yes. On the price issue in the second quarter, we continued to more than offset inflation. Our pricing was about 5% and inflation was about 4%. And that gave us a positive spread of approximately 100 basis points. So solid performance there. We're seeing decreasing costs in some commodities and logistics, offset by other costs and wages in travel. But I feel like we have that really under control with good visibility and the results there speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK's product portfolio.
Deane Dray: Great new products?
Dave Zapico: Yes. New products were a solid quarter. 24% of sales is our vitality index. So what's happening is our customers are buying our new products. And our new products at really good markets. And so we feel really good about that. And significant introductions across the business, I mentioned the Abaco introduction and the word Day 1. But while these are not home run-type swings and our product development is spread out across the business but we have a lot of good things going on.
Deane Dray: You can get to the Hall of Fame with lots of singles and doubles.
Dave Zapico: That's right. That's AMETEK's strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer & Company Inc.
Christopher Glynn: So Dave, reacting to your pitch on Abaco, you closed that out talking about demand for high computing power and analytics like many other AME businesses. Wondering if we could dive into that last dilution there.
Dave Zapico: Yes. When I'm talking about other businesses, I'm talking about what's happening, for example, in some of our process instrumentation businesses, we're doing a lot of work there to improve bringing some technologies that were in the lab to the field. And especially in our Spectro Scientific business where there's a lot of technology that we're putting in smart technology, where there's AI algorithms in it and we're doing measurements that were previously done in the lab, now we're doing them in the field. So that's really good and that's all around our predictive maintenance programs that we have with Spectro Analytics. So we're really positive on that. If you think about our -- some of our materials analysis businesses, there is a tremendous amount of data that we're taking from materials analysis. And we're showing our users that in unique and ways highlighting the technologies, our measurement technology. So you have situation where the graphics power, the graphics intensity of what we're doing is kind of a state of the art. So really, across our businesses, a couple of the trends around predictive maintenance, trends around moving the measurements to the field and trends around in the research environment, the analytical computational power to take the data that we have and provide our users with actionable intelligence is would be the areas I'd highlight.
Christopher Glynn: It's very interesting. And then curious about any areas that might be inflecting higher? I think the question is yours more about anything kind of reaching an inflection or peak junctures. But you did raise the Aero defense market. And I think defense might be one particular area, if you could elaborate.
Dave Zapico: Yes. On both our Aerospace and Defense market, we have not peak. Demand is strong in the commercial market but I talked about it but outlook for the year, both commercial and the defense market have low double-digit outlook. So we're really well positioned in the defense market and some of the things I talked about with Abaco played to that. But both sides of A&D, commercial and defense are strong and we clearly have not peaked.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey of Mizuho.
Brett Linzey: Just wanted to come back to orders. I was hoping you might be able to provide some context for how things track throughout the quarter, any preliminary view on July. And is there anything notable to glean from the changes in the mix of orders between project or CapEx related versus more OpEx purchases?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I'll answer the second part of that first. And -- the thing that I would glean, it's more OEM versus end user. So if we have OEMs between our product and the end customer, the OEMs have inventory in place and as we get back to more normalized activities, the OEM parts of the business are where the order is normalizing. On the end user side of the business, we're not seeing that really at all and end demand still remains strong. Regarding to your first question -- regarding the -- how we progressed throughout the month, we had solid orders in Q2. As typical, orders ramp higher each month of the quarter. So June was the highest month of the quarter. And notably, when we adjust for acquisitions because when you close an acquisition, you book the entire backlog as order input. So we take that out. And if we look to the last couple of years, cumulus like the highest booking or the second highest booking month the last couple of years. So June was really strong. So -- and in terms of July, it's just to close last night and we haven't really dug into it at a deep level but it's certainly up to that point was in line with the growth that we're telling we're communicating here where we're increase our guidance for the second half of the very substantially.
Brett Linzey: And then just shifting over to pricing. As we do work through this normalization of some of the destock dynamic, are there any areas you think there's maybe price concessions? Or do you think you can hold the line on price, if not grow it, in your businesses there?
Dave Zapico: Yes, there's going to be just a small amount of giveback. We're going to retain the vast majority. We're going to retain the vast majority of pricing. And on a go-forward basis, I expect that inflation to moderate a bit but we're going to keep the 100 basis point spread. So we feel real good about the analysis and the control and what's playing out with price. So we'll retain the price and is certainly not going to be a big giveback.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America.
David Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. I guess what's directionally embedded in the revenue guidance for year ending backlog. I understand there's going to begin this normalization of the backlog. I'm wondering if you see that sort of playing out in the second half? Or is that more of a 2024 story?
Dave Zapico: Yes. As I mentioned in the last couple of calls, I do expect our sales to outpace orders in the second half of the year. But it will be a moderate impact and we'll end the year with historically high backlog in comparison to what we've done in the past. So it will be a modest impact as we progress through the second half of the year.
David Ridley-Lane: And then if I'm doing the math right, guidance seems to imply about 40% core incremental margins versus kind of prior expectations of 30% to 35%. What's been improving, what's been going better than you expected?
Dave Zapico: Yes. Margin performance has been great. And in fact, in -- the second quarter, we had really healthy core incrementals of 52%. So you're correct on your outlook for the year and it probably is a bit higher because of our performance has been outstanding. And if you look at reported Anchor, we're both up 130 basis points at the company level, healthy incrementals and -- we think for the full year, the incrementals will be similar in both groups and 40% is a good number.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Joe Giordano. I just wanted to check if there's any color you guys can provide on like some specific end markets in terms of any customer in specifically looking forward, if you have any color on any slowdowns on the medical side, like pressure on biotech because we're hearing from other people who are in the industry that there's been some pressure and some slowdown in that area.
Dave Zapico: I mentioned that some of our automation customers are in the med tech and life sciences world and we are seeing the impact of inventory destock and that's included in our overall guidance. But in terms of our overall medical business, not including that piece of the automation business. Q2, we were up mid-teens. So really strong and strong growth in our engineered medical components business and a very significant performance for AMETEK in the second quarter and for the full year.
Operator: So, I do not see any other questions at this point. I would now like to turn the conference back to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Benny, for all your help and thank you for joining us for our conference call today. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an excellent start to 2023 with outstanding results in the first quarter. Continued solid demand across our diverse set of end markets led to strong sales in order of growth and another record backlog. Our businesses delivered tremendous operating performance with record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter. Additionally, we generated record cash flows and reported a portion of that cash flow on our first acquisition of the year Bison Gear & Engineering. Given these results and the outlook for the remainder of 2023, we are increasing our sales earnings guidance for the full year. Now let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.6 million up 10% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was excellent at 9%. Acquisitions added 2 points while foreign currency was a slight headwind. AMETEK’s continued strong organic sales growth reflects its success of our organic growth initiatives and our leadership positions across diverse and attractive niche markets. Demand also remains solid with overall orders growing 6% in the quarter. Organic orders were up low single digit on a percentage basis against the difficult prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.13 in the quarter for our 11th consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.4 billion an increase of over $200 million from the end of 2022. As noted, AMETEK’s operating performance in the first quarter was exceptional. Operating income in the quarter was a record $405.5 million a 15% increase over the first quarter of 2022. Operating margins were a record 25.4% in the quarter up 120 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins were to exclude acquisition dilution and the gain from our facility sale in the first quarter of 2022 or up an impressive 180 basis points with strong core margin expansion in each group. EBITDA in the quarter was $482 million up 11% over the prior year and EBITDA margins were 30.2%. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating model a differentiation of our businesses and the great work of our teams. This tremendous operating performance led to a high quality of earnings with diluted earnings per share of $1.49 up 12% versus the prior first quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.38, $1.42 per share. Now let me provide some additional details of the operating group level. First, the electronic instruments group. EIG delivered excellent sales growth and operating performance with sales up 13% versus the prior year to $1.12 billion. Organic sales were up 11%, acquisitions added three percentage points with foreign currency of slight headwind in the quarter. This strong organic sales growth is broad based of our businesses and geographies with growth particularly strong across our aerospace and defense businesses in the quarter. EIG’s operating profit was impressive resulting in a record operating profit in the quarter. Operating income was $309.7 million up 27% versus the prior year, while EIG margins were 27.7% up a robust 290 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also delivered excellent results in the quarter with solid organic sales growth and strong operating performance. EMG's first quarter sales were $479.9 million, up 2% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 4% in the quarter and foreign currency a 2-point headwind. Growth was notably strong across our Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the first quarter was $120.5 million, and operating margins were 25.1%. On a core basis, excluding acquisition dilution and the gain from a facility sale in the first quarter of 2022, EMG margins were up 50 basis points versus last year's first quarter. So overall tremendous performance by our businesses and all AMETEK colleagues. All elements of the AMETEK growth model, operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions are working well. These strategies allow us to quickly react to changing market conditions, invest in our businesses for long-term growth and deploy our capital on value-enhancing acquisitions. Now switching to our capital deployment and acquisition strategy. The primary focus for our strong cash flow remains strategic acquisitions. We are managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates, and we have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity to support this strategy. I'm excited to announce our most recent acquisition, Bison Gear & Engineering. Bison is an excellent strategic fit with AMETEK's automation businesses, helping expand our presence within this attractive secular growth market. Bison is a leading provider of customized motion control solutions for use across a wide range of high-precision applications within the automation, food and beverage, power and transportation markets. Bison's portfolio of linear and motion control technology is highly complementary with existing technologies, providing an expanded product offering that enables wider and deeper market participation in attractive markets and applications, including growing electrification requirements. Bison is based in St. Charles, Illinois, and has annual sales of approximately $80 million. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we remain focused on ensuring sustainable growth by investing in organic growth initiatives. This includes making strategic growth investments and driving broader adoption of growth has ends, digitalization and new product development. For all of 2023, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in support of these growth initiatives, including investments in research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. One way we celebrate and recognize the great work of our businesses, new product development efforts is through the AMETEK Innovation Award. This award is provided annually to the AMETEK business who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded organic growth opportunity. The most recent innovation award winner was our Creaform business for developing its innovative new handheld 3D metrology solution, PL3. Creaform, based in Levy, Canada, is a leading provider of 3D portable and automated measurement technologies for applications such as reverse engineering, quality control, product development and non-destructive testing. The introduction of PL3 further expands the breadth of Creaform's metrology offering and makes high-end 3D scanning accessible to professionals and small enterprises, opening up a new attractive market segment. In addition to the PL3, Creaform also recently added a new scanner to their HandySCAN 3D platform, the HandySCAN BLACK Alete Limited. The latest addition to Creaform's flagship metrology-grade 3D scanners set a new industry standard for handheld devices. I would like to extend my congratulations to the entire Creaform team for their innovative new products and on-going efforts to push into boundaries and metrology. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain cautious in the short term due to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. However, given the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage through these challenges. The company's record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid and long-cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth. Given our strong first quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up mid-to-high single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid-single digits, with organic sales expected to be up mid-single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.96 to $6.10, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.84 to $6 per diluted share. For the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid to high-single digits with earnings of $1.49 to $1.51 per share, up 8% to 9% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK had an excellent first quarter. We delivered strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, a record backlog, record cash flows and increased our earnings guidance for the year. The company's differentiated technology solutions, market-leading positions in attractive markets and proven operating capabilities have allowed us to navigate through challenging economic cycles. Additionally, AMETEK's strong cash flows and robust balance sheet provide us meaningful flexibility to deploy capital to drive shareholder value. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK had an outstanding first quarter, positioning us well to start the year. We delivered record-level operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $5 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense, as well as the return to more normal levels of discretionary spending. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly versus 2022 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales, below 2022's level of 1.5 percent of sales. Other income and expense was a headwind of $8 million in the quarter, due largely to lower pension income and higher due diligence costs. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5% versus 19% in the first quarter of 2022. For 2023, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $20 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million for the full or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $335 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million, or $0.58 [Ph] per diluted share. Operating working capital in the first quarter was 19.2% of sales. Cash flow was outstanding in the quarter a sizeable growth versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was a record $370 million up 92% versus the first quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was also a record of $367 million up 110% over the prior year. While free cash flow conversion was a very strong 120% of net income. Total debt at March 31st was $2.25 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $400 million. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the first quarter was 1.1 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times. During the first quarter, we acquired Bison Gear and Engineering, and we remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital, given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have significant financial capacity, with approximately $2.6 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our business has delivered exceptional results to start the year with strong organic sales growth, robust margin expansion and high-quality earnings. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Chris, could we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson & Company. Your line is now open.
Matt Summerville: Thanks, Morning. A couple questions. Dave, can you remind us what you consider to be your canary-like businesses and how they may be informing your go-forward kind of view on the environment? Obviously, you sound pretty positive this morning. And then I have a follow-up.
Dave Zapico: Yes. Matt, we have largely mid and long-cycle businesses, so we don't have a short-cycle canary. And what used to be our canary was our cost-driven motors business in the floor-care market. But we've largely --that's not a part of the portfolio. So what we're looking at right now is really strength across our portfolio. So we don't see any canaries right now.
Matt Summerville: And just a follow-up, Dave, can you talk about where you were in Q1 with respect to price-cost, what that's going to look like, and the magnitude of absolute realization you expect in 2023 versus 2022? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Right. Great question, Matt. In that first quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. Our pricing was a bit more than 5%, and inflation was about 4%. So we had a spread of a little more than 100 basis points. And for the full year, we expect the incremental pricing to moderate a bit. So we think we'll get 4% for the entire year. So -- and the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership position in the niche markets that we operate in. So we're pretty positive on pricing, and we're getting value, and we're adding value to our customers also. So we think it can continue for some time. While inflation may moderate a bit, we think it's going to be here for a while, and we think we can outpace inflation with price.
Matt Summerville: Perfect. Thank you, David.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. This question comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: Can you, Dave, just talk about I know you don't really have the canary in the coal mine, but you did note, a little bit more cautious view, just given the macro. I would say any noticeable trends that you're -- that's driving some of that cautious view for you guys, just in terms of what you're seeing? Obviously, backlog and results were pretty solid today. Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Yes, we're confident in our guide and for the balance of the year, but we are cautious given how early we are in the year and given the risks in a global macro environment. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our book-to-bill was 1.13. That's pretty strong. And if you take out the bison acquisition, it was still 1.1. It was positive in both groups. Our backlog is over 50% of annual sales is well above normal historical levels. So I think we're pretty well positioned to perform this year. We have mentioned that there is an expectation that we're returning to more normalized ordering patterns. And now that the supply chain is improving and we're seeing some of that play out. And we also have some difficult comps. But when you look across our portfolio, we're feeling really good. We're mid and long cycle. And it feels like the biggest part of our business, EIG, is starting to accelerate. So we're feeling pretty good.
Allison Poliniak: Great. And then, nice acquisition with bison to start the year. Any color you can provide on and sort of the M&A pipeline, what you're seeing, are multiples becoming more reasonable for you guys? Any thoughts there? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Right. That's a great question. And, we really like the bison deal. We deployed about $100 million on it. And it's an excellent fit with our automation business. We talked about expanding our capabilities there. But more broadly, we have a very, very wide and deep pipeline. And that pipeline is filled with attractive candidates. And it feels like the pricing has come in a bit. And it feels like we're in good position to continue our acquisition strategy and provide a differentiator in coming quarters and years with our strong balance sheet and with our capability there and with our strong pipeline. I'm fairly optimistic that with the pricing coming in and our strong -- we've done work for many years on developing the pipeline of deals, that we're going to have some success this year.
Allison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay, Allison.
Operator: One moment for our next question. This question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Maybe we can take the tour of the key end markets and maybe you can start with arrow and defense because that got called out in both segments. Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Right, right. Exactly Deane. Our aerospace and defense business had an excellent start to the year. Both overall and organic sales were up mid-20s in the first quarter. And we really saw growth across all A&D segments, but our defense and our commercial aftermarket segments were particularly strong. And given the strong start to the year and the positive end market tailwinds, we now expect our organic sales to increase and to be up 10% for the full year with similar growth across both our commercial and defense segments. Next, I'll go to Process. Overall sales for our Process businesses increased 10% in the quarter. Organic sales were up 10%. We had the acquisition of Navitor, largely being offset by foreign currency headwinds. And similar to last year, growth was broad-based in the quarter as end market demand remains solid across key process end markets, including research, medical, oil and gas. And looking ahead, we expect to continue strong organic sales growth for process, and we expect to be up mid-single digits for the year. And moving to the Power & Industrial segment. Strong results in the first quarter with overall sales up low teens. This growth was driven by low single-digit organic growth and contributions from our recent acquisition, RTDS. And we continue to expect mid-single-digit organic growth for our Power & Industrial businesses in 2023, with similar growth expected across both our Power & Industrial segments. And finally, our Automation & Engineered Solutions. Organic sales were flat in the first quarter and in line with our expectations given prior year comparisons and timing of customer shipments. For all of 2023, we continue to expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered solutions business to be up mid-single digits with similar growth rates across both our Automation & Engineered Solutions business. That's a walk around the company, Deane.
Deane Dray: That’s all really helpful. Thank you. And a follow-up question is actually a follow-up to Allison's question around normalizing and normalization of the supply chain. So maybe if you could just expand on that, product scarcity. How has that played out? And anything on -- when you said normalized order patterns, so what the customers spacing out the orders at smaller size? And anything -- and maybe for Bill, are you releasing buffer inventory because before it was -- recently it's just in case, now coming back a bit more to just in time, but will you be releasing any of this buffer inventory? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Yes. The -- I'd just comment that there is a return to more normalized ordering patterns because lead times are back to normal. And the customers aren't ordering early now that the supply chain has improved, and we're seeing that dynamic play out. And it plays out more in our OEM-related businesses than our end market businesses. So a little more in EMG than EIG, but it's what we've been communicating for several quarters we were expecting. And overall, we're very pleased with the order of performance. We're very pleased with our record backlog. We -- our book-to-bill was up in both groups, and the normalization is really getting back to -- just getting back to normal lead times.
William Burke: And Deane, from the inventory perspective, we did add a little bit in the quarter, but we'd expect as we progress through the balance of the year, you're going to see that release of inventories that we've built up over the last year or so, as you say, just in case in protecting our customers and making sure we had enough right inventory on hand.
Deane Dray: And would we see that inventory release result in some higher free cash flow conversion, maybe just above normal seasonality?
Dave Zapico: I think it will be -- it's -- we're going to be continuing to grow the business, which requires working capital, but I think you will see a release in the inventories as being a benefit to the overall free cash flow, which we'd expect would be in that 120% area for all of 2023.
Deane Dray: That’s great to hear. Thank you.
William Burke: Then, we had record operating cash flow, record free cash flow and 120% conversion in the first quarter. So we think as our business is getting back to normal, you're going to see benefits in the cash flow.
Deane Dray: That’s great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. This next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Hey good morning guys. Dave, I just want to dig in a little bit here on throughput. So you built backlog this quarter, but you had a pretty sizable revenue beat. So I guess that's the good news. But maybe the other side of that is how should we think about where you're at, I guess, particularly on EIG in terms of is there an ability to kind of ramp revenue further based on your own supply capability or your own kind of willingness to eat into the backlog? Like how should we think about your own throughput or kind of backlog conversion through the year? Is this sort of where you'd like to be? Or do you want to raise that higher just given the cyclical backdrop?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think EIG is more of a long-cycle business. And as these supply issues resolve, we're able to convert on more. And I would expect our backlog to stay strong for the balance of the year. I'd expect it to be a little bit lower at the end of the year, but it's still in excess of typical. And in my view, EIG is just starting to fire on all cylinders. I mean it's just really across the board. And one of the things that's happening in EIG is along with strong growth, along with solid pricing, the profit performance from the recent acquisition has been excellent. And for RTDS and Navacar, the acquisitions we did last year, they're doing well. And you're seeing Abaco also have a very strong year-over-year quarter in margins. So it feels really good for EIG. And I don't think we've taken our foot off the gas.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just on your automation business. You have some of the folks out there that are more in kind of the controller, mainline automation gear, that are sitting on big orders, record backlogs as well. Are you seeing this from mega projects and things like nearshoring, the same as those folks? Or where you fit into that value chain? Is there's something different driving the business?
Dave Zapico: No, it's similar. I mean we're in precision motion control. So we're moving things to automate them. And we're diverse end markets. We're in medical and factory automation and a bunch of end markets. But just the business that we acquired, Bison Gear & Engineering is a perfect example of what you're talking about. I mean they have about a year of backlog. And they're really capacity limited, and that's something that we can fix in relatively quick order. And it's a business with to provide us a lot of cost synergy, but at the same time, growth drivers of automation and freeing up capacity to go after reshoring and electrification requirements are really on our sweet spot. So -- while we largely have the capacity in our existing businesses, we can really improve Bison. So that's in line with what you're saying in these automation markets where there's secular growth drivers and good strong backlogs.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Excellent. Thanks all I have for you guys.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Stand by for the next question. This question comes from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is open.
Robert Wertheimer: So I wanted to circle back to M&A, where some peers have called out a very strong M&A market, including, I think, one person call it kind of one of the best ever. And your comments were very positive that could very well be AMETEK execution developing the time. So I'm curious about your general feel on the M&A markets. And if they are quite strong, I think you indicated prices coming down, what's changing in the dynamics there?
Dave Zapico: Yes. The overall M&A market in the first quarter was down quite a bit. So the overall market is not that good. And -- but what you have is a lot of buyers are cautious now, and it's because of financing capability. A lot of the private equity businesses are less active right now. But we're largely a self-funded acquisition strategy. And we have, as Bill said, over $2.6 billion of cash in existing credit facilities. And our pipeline of opportunities remain strong, and we're very active in exploring it. And we are really a meaningful level of financing to make some headway. So it's a good opportunity for us to use this aspect of our strategy to differentiate our performance in the future. And we're very excited with the companies that are -- we've recently acquired. We're also very excited about the companies that we're working with. And we're growing our presence in attractive growth areas, and we'll stick to delivering our traditional financial orders. They are important thresholds for us. And we want to provide a strong level of returns on the capital we deploy. So it's the same setup, but at the same time, I think we're in an incrementally better position because we're a strategic buyer that has a strong balance sheet, that has cash flow and has a viable pipeline of deals.
Robert Wertheimer: Great. That makes total sense. Thank you. And then just to go in a different direction, to follow up on your comment on, you mentioned like 5, 4 maybe pricing phase a little bit barely really towards the end of the year. Is it more to give us a sense of what's happening in the cost base inflation? Have you seen dramatic down in some areas or logistics or whomever? I'm just curious give us a little bit of sense of breakdown there.
Dave Zapico: Right. As I said, our inflation was about 4%. We're seeing decreasing costs in some commodities, some logistic costs, but there's other inflationary costs and things like wages and travel. So there's net inflation for sure, and it's sticky, but we think it will moderate a bit this year from what we're seeing. So -- but we're well positioned to deal with that with our pricing in our portfolio of companies.
Robert Wertheimer: Thank you.
Operator: Please stand by for the next question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks good morning everyone. [Indiscernible] so if we go back to sort of late January, February, when you put together the 1Q plan, obviously, it came in a lot stronger, which is not untypical, but I think the upside is a bit more than normal. So maybe just talk about what surprised you to the upside? Clearly, A&D was was a lot stronger. I'm wondering if you saw an inflection in defense. Curious if you saw maybe China coming in a lot better than perhaps expected. Just kind of walk off better. And maybe talk about was it mainly backlog conversion supply chain driven or customer demand driven?
Dave Zapico: Yes. The first point was our positive book-to-bill in both groups and overall, it was also order driven, not just backlog driven. The second point is what really is changing is the supply chain is getting much better. So we're able to convert on more backlog. And in China, in particular, you mentioned it was up about 12% growth. So it was a good grower. And as they're recovering from there COVID lockdowns, our business is developing nicely there. So it's really both. We had good book-to-bill, we convert on the backlog and we're strong across all geographies.
Nigel Coe: No, there's no question about it. You talked about the expectation that you'd expect to burn some backlog between now and year-end. You talked about order patents changing, which is very natural with the supply chain improvements. Have you seen that change, David, happened already? Did that sort of happen in March, April? Are we starting to burn backlog through the second quarter? Curious on what you see in real time.
Dave Zapico: Yes. We started to see a little bit the chip patterns last year. We started calling out last year, and we did see it. And it's mainly our OEM businesses. It's not so much in -- we're selling directly to end users because we have customized products, and they pretty much aren't going to over order a lot of expensive things like that. But on our OEM businesses, we have been seeing it for a while, and we did see it in the quarter.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Great. And then it seems like I'm close to the end of the queue here. So maybe I'll throw 1 more question if I can. The Bison deal, motion control, I don't think we've seen the motion control acquisition for some time or one of the size. Is there a desire to maybe do more of these kinds of deals, maybe become a bit more of a scale player in motion control?
Dave Zapico: I think there is a desire, but we need the technology and the business has to be successful and a niche, and we have to add value to it. And I think there are a few other businesses that we're looking at right now that would be very attractive to us. And Bison just fit all those characteristics. We can add substantial value. It was a fair price. It has capability that we don't have. And we can really improve the business to address -- go after more of the applications that they have been not able to go after. So it really fits in our toolkit and really adds value to our solution offerings. And there are other businesses like that we're looking at. And there are several businesses that we're looking at. And -- but we're going to be -- we're going to wait for the right opportunities, and I think those opportunities are showing up.
Nigel Coe: Great. Thanks Dave.
Dave Zapico: Okay. Thank you Nigel.
Operator: One moment for the next question. This question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Hey thanks good morning Dave, Bill, Kevin. Amazing to see the 1.1x organic book-to-bill at this point in the supply chain in the cycle. But I did want to ask about Abaco, as you just kind of hit the 2-year anniversary. Just curious for an overall kind of update on the past 2 years integrating, getting to know that business. And is it episodic? Or is it in, in a nice kind of scaling mode here would you project?
Dave Zapico: No, it's definitely not episodic. I mean, we had -- if you go back after we first bought it, we get the supply chain crisis in electronics, and we had to work through all of that. And we've also augmented the management team. And I think we're really in the right gear now with that business. The defense market is strong. We're in the right areas. So that business is going to accelerate and be a big contributor for us going forward.
Christopher Glynn: Great. And on the organic kind of mid-single-digit outlook, could you kind of parse that, how you're thinking about the two segments relative to one another? Similar kind of outperformance from the first quarter at EIG, do we expect that to continue?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think both groups have a very good chance to grow mid-single digits for the full year organically. EIG, a little bit stronger than EMG, but both groups have the potential to grow mid-single digits.
Christopher Glynn: Great. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you Chris.
Operator: One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Lot of commentary about improvements to supply chain. Just to go down a little, what about in your Aerospace business? We've heard more mixed messages about component availability and it could be constraints revenue. Obviously, you had very strong revenue growth this quarter, just an update on Aero's specific supply chain.
Dave Zapico: The aero-specific supply chain is improving as our entire supply chain is. And we grew mid-20% organic growth in the quarter. We have a good supply chain team there, a good management team running that business. So it feels like that business is accelerating. That was our strongest area, and we took out the year on that segment. So there are always challenges in different markets. And -- but in the Aerospace right now, I see us accelerating growth is what we're looking at.
David Ridley-Lane: Thanks for that. And then on the Electronic Instruments Group, that commentary is very interesting that you're actually seeing some re-acceleration in demand. Are there any secular themes that you would point to? Can you identify certain maybe reshoring-related projects, etcetera, that are helpful there?
Dave Zapico: More than the secular -- there are secular opportunities driving growth. A lot of it is our approach and our niche focus. We have very flexible businesses that are aggressive. They go after where the niche opportunities are. I'll give you a couple of examples. In the semiconductor market, our Semiconductor business, which is about 6% of our sales, it was actually up in the first quarter. And most semiconductor businesses are up in the first quarter. And the reason is that, well, we participate some in the memory area that was down. We also participate in semiconductor research, which is very strong now. In the EUV optics within semiconductors were just very strong. So at the same time, there is some weakness in the market. We're very agile and can adapt, and we've been doing that for years, and we're growing. So I think that the big thing, I think, when you look across our whole businesses is are there growth opportunities for sure. We're very agile. Our distributor model lets us get after them with management teams dedicated to businesses and markets. And I don't see that stopping.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you for the details.
Dave Zapico: Thank you David.
Operator: One moment for the next question. This question comes from Michael Anastasiou of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Michael Anastasiou: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. There's been some commentary as of late for destocking in different areas of the medical and life science-related end markets. Can you just briefly describe where your portfolio specifically plays in that area and your outlook for the year? Any color would be appreciated.
Dave Zapico: Sure. The medical market is about 15% of our sales now. And in the quarter, it was up high teens with strong growth in our Rauland business and also our Engineered mechanical components business. And for the full year, we expect it to be up high single digits. So we expect to be growing in that medical space. And it's much like the discussion I just had with David about we're in the right niches because in Rauland, their primary product are really to improve the efficiency of nurses. And as long as I've been alive, you have nursing shortages in the United States and Rauland's nurse call systems make nurses more efficient. So coming out of the pandemic, we see a lot of spending on dealing with the shortages, and Rauland has great products and very successful in that area. And in our EMC business, we're dealing with a lot of single procedure, single-use-type devices that we're building components for and that business is accelerating. So both of those core businesses that make up the large part of our medical businesses are doing well, and we were up high teens in the quarter.
Michael Anastasiou: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. Our last question comes from Joseph Donahue of Baird. Your line is open.
Joseph Donahue: Hey guys. I am on for Rob. How are you doing?
Dave Zapico: Good.
Joseph Donahue: The kind of following up on the commentary that you had earlier. Could you just kind of take the temperature on R&D spending? Should we expect it to stay strong, you think, through the rest of the year?
Dave Zapico: In relation to the semiconductor, I think there's a lot happening now for -- we're transitioning from one technology to -- new technology and smaller and smaller nodes. So I think that we're seeing the strength in semiconductor research spending, and it's one of the strongest areas of our business right now. Again, it's another area where we're in the right niche.
Joseph Donahue: Got you. And then this could just be on our side, but EMG looked a little bit below normal seasonal growth. Is there any difference in supply improvement across the two segments going on or anything else that we should be thinking about?
Dave Zapico: I think when you look at EMG the organic growth was up 4%. So they had a good, good quarter. You had some headwinds from currency. And so EIG grew faster for sure, but EMG was still really solid.
Joseph Donahue: Got it. Alright, thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A segment. I'll now turn it back over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining our conference call today. As a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.
Operator: And thank you all for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the AMETEK’s Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK’s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risk and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2021 or 2022 results or 2023 guidance will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with AMETEK's results in the fourth quarter, and for all of 2022. AMETEK's continued excellent performance reflects the quality of our niche-differentiated businesses, the strength of the AMETEK growth model, and the expanding impact of our organic growth initiatives, and most importantly, the outstanding efforts of our global employees. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your many contributions to our success. We have navigated many challenges over the last few years only to emerge stronger and even better positioned for sustained growth. Our results in the fourth quarter were outstanding. Stronger-than-expected sales growth and excellent operating performance led to a high quality of earnings which exceeded our expectations in the quarter. We ended the year with a record backlog as demand remains solid across our diverse end markets. Organic growth was again very strong in the quarter as our teams are successfully driving key organic growth initiatives across their businesses and expanding their presence serving attractive growth markets. Operationally, we're performing exceptionally well and offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in strong margin expansion. Additionally, cash flow in the quarter was outstanding, providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses and deploy capital on strategic acquisitions. Now, on to the results of the fourth quarter and all of 2022, fourth quarter sales were $1.63 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 9%, acquisitions added two points. And foreign currency was a three-point headwind in the quarter. Orders were solid in the fourth quarter against a challenging comparison, resulting in a record backlog of $3.22 billion. Operating income in the quarter was a record $398 million, a 10% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.5% in the quarter, up 50 basis points [technical difficulty] from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $489 million, up 12% over the prior year. And EBITDA margins were an impressive 30.1%. This outstanding operating performance led to record earnings of $1.52 per diluted share, up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2021, and above our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.47 per share. Now, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level; first, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered continued strong sales growth and excellent operating performance. Sales for EIG were a record $1.16 billion in the quarter, up 10% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 9%, acquisitions added 3%, and foreign currency was a three-point headwind. EIG growth was broad-based with particularly strong growth across our Aerospace & Defense and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses in the quarter. EIG's operating income in the fourth quarter was a record $307 million, up 10% versus the prior year, while EIG margins were a very strong 26.5% in the quarter. The Electromechanical Group also finished the year with outstanding performance. EMG's fourth quarter sales were $466 million, up 4% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 8%, and foreign currency a three-point headwind. Growth was again broad-based across EMG, with our Aerospace & Defense businesses leading the growth. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $115 million, up 9% compared to the prior year period. EMG's fourth quarter operating margins were 24.6%, up an impressive 100 basis points versus the prior year. Now for the full-year results; overall, performance was outstanding in 2022, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.15 billion, up 11% from 2021. Organic sales increased 11%, acquisitions added 2%, and foreign currency was a three-point headwind. Operating income for 2022 was $1.5 billion, up 15%. And operating margins were 24.4%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year. While core margins up and impressive 130 basis points, reflecting our ability to successfully manage inflation and supply chain challenges. EBITDA for the year was $1.83 billion, up 15% from 2021, with EBITDA margins a very strong 29.7%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. Full-year earnings were $5.68 per diluted share, up an impressive 17% versus the prior year. AMETEK's performance in a challenging operating environment highlights the proven strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to successfully navigate through uncertain economic times. Our businesses continue to leverage the key elements of the AMETEK growth model to accelerate global growth, develop innovative new products, and identify and execute on operational efficiency improvements. Additionally, our businesses worked closely with our corporate development team to manage our acquisition pipeline, resulting in a continued strong deployment of capital on strategic acquisitions. In 2021 and 2022 combined, we deployed over $2.4 billion in capital on eight acquisitions, and acquired over $600 million in annual sales. We expect to remain active in 2023 as our deal pipeline remains very strong, and our balance sheet provides us significant financial capacity to deploy capital. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we remain committed to investing in organic growth initiatives and are very pleased with the impact these investments are having on AMETEK's growth. As I highlighted during our last earnings call, AMETEK's portfolio has strategically evolved with increased exposure to higher growth market segments. This portfolio evolution has been driven by our acquisition strategy and by the organic investments we are making in our businesses. In 2023, we expect to invest an incremental $90 million in support of these growth initiatives, including investments across research, development, and engineering, and sales and marketing. One way we measure the success of these investments is through our Vitality Index, which was an outstanding 27% of sales in 2022. Our increased investments in RD&E continue to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, including within our Zygo business. Zygo, which is based in Middlefield, Connecticut, designs and manufactures advanced optical metrology systems and ultra-precise optical components and assembles for a diverse set of end markets, including defense, research, and semiconductor. Zygo partnered with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's National Ignition Facility to provide high-end precision optics in support of their inertial fusion energy testing program, which provides a significant leap forward in the realization of sustainable fusion energy. Achieving these heights of energy production requires the use of highly precise optics and scalable manufacturing processes which were developed in partnership with Zygo. I want to congratulate the Zygo team for their tremendous contributions supporting important advancements in research and technology. Lastly, let me briefly touch on the supply chain issues and inflation. While tightness remains in certain areas, we're seeing improvements in the global supply and logistics. Additionally, although inflation remains elevated, we are also seeing modest improvements versus levels experienced in 2022. As we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to proactively manage our supply chain and remain confident in our ability to offset inflation with price increases. Now, shifting to our outlook for the year ahead, while macroeconomic uncertainties remain, we are confident in the quality of our businesses, the flexibility of the AMETEK growth model, and our ability to navigate through these uncertain times. Additionally, given our record backlog and proven operating capability, we are confident in our outlook for 2023. For 2023, we expect both overall and organic sales to be up mid-single-digits versus 2022. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.84 to $6, up 3% to 6% compared to last year's results. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales up mid-single-digits with adjusted earnings up $1.38, of the $1.38 to $1.42, up 4% to 7% versus the prior-year. In summary, AMETEK's fourth quarter and full-year results were excellent, our record backlog, the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model and a world class workforce position us nicely for 2023. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions, Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong fourth quarter to complete an outstanding year. In the quarter, we delivered record level operating performance at a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and for the full-year along with some additional guidance for 2023. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were essentially flat versus the prior-year and for the full-year general and administrative expenses were up $6 million, driven largely by higher compensation costs. And as a percentage of sales were 1.5% versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly versus 2022 levels and remain at approximately 1.5% of sales. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 18.9%, up from 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021. For 2023, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20% and as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Capital expenditures were $58 million in the fourth quarter, and $139 million for the full-year. Capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to be approximately $114 million, or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $89 million, and for the full-year was $320 million. In 2023, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $325 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $154 million or $0.66 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18.9% of sales. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was excellent with operating cash flow of $385 million, up 37% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was also up 37% to $327 million in the quarter, while free cash flow conversion was 106% of net income. Total debt at year-end was $2.39 billion down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $345 million and during the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $240 million on the acquisition of RTDS Technologies. Gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at year-end was 1.2 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times. As Dave noted, we remain active on the acquisition front with a solid pipeline of acquisition candidates. Given our strong cash flow and modest levels of leverage, we're well-positioned to deploy additional capital. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2022 delivering strong growth and high quality of earnings in a challenging operating environment. AMETEK is well-positioned for 2023, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model, and our world-class workforce. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Rocco, can we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: Can we turn organic investments, the $90 million, if I recall, I think that's a step-down from what you did in '22, just any color there, is there just some conservative nature just given the uncertainty out there, are there unusual projects in '22, just any thoughts on that side?
Dave Zapico: Yes, that's to start off the year, and there a potential to do more, and -- but the $90 million was a good number, and it's incremental; Keep in mind, incremental over what we've done in 2022. So, it's incremental, and we're making healthy investments in RD&E, it's up double digits for the year, and healthy investments for sales and marketing. So, we think the $90 million is appropriate. And, obviously, that can be flexed up or down if required.
Allison Poliniak: Great. And then a lot of concerns, I mean, out there about potentially some weakness showing up in H2. Just any thoughts on your end, what you're seeing in terms of that? Is there anything concerning or sort of popping out that has you a bit worried as we enter the back-half of '23 and into '24?
Dave Zapico: Not really. I mean, the -- obviously, our growth is slowing, but the record backlogs and we're executing very well, we're getting the price, and it still feels good to us. It feels strong and good. And when you get out to the second-half of 2023, I mean this is a -- there's less visibility because you're further out, but our backlog is at a record level. It's usually at about 30% of annual sales. And right now, it's running at about 50% of annual sales. So, we feel really good. And we don't see a slowdown yet.
Allison Poliniak: Perfect, thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay, thank you, Allison.
Operator: And the next question today comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: I was hoping you'd take us through the key end markets. And then also on the regional updates, it's been interesting, maybe people got too negative on Europe. So, like to know how Europe did. And then China reopening, how does that impact you all?
Dave Zapico: Sure, Deane. I'll start with your second question, the geographical outlook. Strong, broad-based growth across most geographies. Our Asia region was flat on China headwinds. And to your point, our fastest growing market was Europe. Europe was up 12% with notable strength in both our process and aerospace defense markets. And then we had a really strong performance in the U.S., up 10% organically; broad-based strength, notable strength in our process businesses. And in Asia, as I said, it was flat, with notable strength in aerospace and defense, and process. And China was down for us low double digits in the quarter on a difficult prior-year comp, and the impact of the Zero COVID policy. And Asia, we think that the China situation is going to turn around as the reopening occurs. And we're pretty optimistic for it in the second-half. But that's the picture in Q4, really strong broad-based growth, strongest Europe, and second U.S. Most of Asia was really good, and in China there was some weakness. Okay, and the second question was in market segment's summery. I'll take a walk around the company. In our process area, our overall process businesses, they were up high-single digits in the quarter. Organic sales were up 10%, and you also had the contributions from the acquisition of Navitar and it was offset by foreign currency headwinds. And as we saw throughout last year, growth across our process businesses was particularly -- was broad-based, but it was particularly strong in our Ultra Precision Technologies businesses in the quarter. And as we look ahead to 2023, we expect organic sales for process businesses to be up mid-single digits for the year. Next I'll talk about Aerospace & Defense. Our Aerospace & Defense businesses had a very strong finish to the year, and with overall and organic sales up mid teens. So, that was the strongest growth rate of the year for Aerospace & Defense. Our commercial businesses led the growth in the quarter. We had sales of high teens on a percentage business in the commercial business. And Defense was also strong in the quarter, growing low double digits. And for all of 2023, we expect organic sales for our Aerospace & Defense businesses to be up mid-to-high single digits, with commercial aerospace growth expected to be modestly stronger than defense growth. I'll next go to our Power & Industrial, overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up high single digits in the fourth quarter, driven by mid single-digit organic growth and the contributions from the acquisition of RTDS. Growth in the quarter was particularly strong across our programmable power business. For all of 2023, we expect organic sales for our Power & Industrial business to be up mid single digits, with similar growth across both the Power & Industrials segments. And finally, I'll talk about our Automation & Engineered Solutions market segment. And overall sales were up low single digits in the fourth quarter, with very solid mid single-digit organic sales growth, had some currency headwind in that segment. I was very pleased with the overall growth and the performance of Automation & Engineered Solutions in 2022. They're continuing to expand exposures in attractive niche markets. And in particular, our Engineered Medical Components business saw strong growth in the quarter. And in 2023, we expect organic sales for our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses to be up mid single digits, with similar growth expected across both our Automation and Engineered Solutions business. That's a walk around the company. Deane, do you have any more questions?
Deane Dray: Yes, just as a follow-up, just how would you characterize the pace of orders, industrial demand, the size of orders, is there -- just with respect to how normalization might be happening for AMETEK's businesses?
Dave Zapico: That's a great question, Deane. Our overall orders were up 1.5% in the quarter. And the overall demand environment, as I answered Allison's questions, feels really solid. We had our 10th straight positive book-to-bill quarter. And we ended with an all-time record backlog as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And this level of backlog, as I said, was 50% of our annual sales, well above the normal level of 30%. And it's up 78% from the end of 2020. So, we're in a really strong position as we enter 2023. So, your question on some of the nuances, if you recall, over the last couple of earnings calls, we highlighted a couple of dynamics that would impact our order growth. But the first was the difficult comparisons we're facing because as orders have been strong for an extended period of time. To give some context, over the prior nine quarters, our orders grew over 20% a quarter. So, it's been sizable and sustained that that helped build the backlog. The second dynamic we highlighted was the expectation of customers to return to more normalized ordering patterns. Now that the supply chain is improving and -- we started to see that dynamic play out in the fourth quarter. So, overall, we're comfortable with our order levels in Q4. After starting off in January and we just finished January, we had another sold orders a month, ahead of our expectations, and solidly up from January 2022 order levels. So, again, we're feeling pretty good with a strong backlog and our orders are hanging in there. So, we think that we're in -- looking at a pretty good year.
Deane Dray: It's all really helpful. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay, thank you, Deane.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning, all.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Linzey: Hey. And just wanted to come back to the inventories, some of your peers have been talking about some elevated inventory in some of the OEM channels. Just curious what you're seeing there in some of your serve businesses, serve markets, and if there's any area of concern there?
Dave Zapico: Yes, the first point I'd like to make is that when you're looking at customer inventories, a lot of our products are customized, and they're high-value products. So, we don't really have a lot of distributor stocking issues to worry about. That's particularly true in EIG. In EMG, there's more of an OEM deal with the customer base, and that's where you're seeing a bit of the customer ordering patterns normalize. But overall, we think we've got a good handle on it, and we feel pretty good about where we're at.
Brett Linzey: Yes, okay, that's great. And just shifting to the 2023 outlook, I was hoping maybe you could put a finer point on just the underlying assumptions. How much price do you expect verses volume? And then anything specific on the quarterly phasing, I mean do you think you'll get growth in both the first-half, second-half, or as you work down the backlog, does it begin to decline there in the second-half?
Dave Zapico: Yes, great question. I mean with our budget model, we pretty much have a traditional first quarter. So, it's not really second-half-biased. And we think we'll grow in each of the quarters of the year. And in terms of pricing, in our budget model we have about four points of price. And we assume that we assume that we have about 3.5 points of inflation. So, we are going to offset price and inflation by about 50 basis points. Now, that’s down a bit from 2022 where six points of price. And we offset about 5 points of inflation. But, it’s the guide for the entire year. And we are being a bit conservative now. And, we will probably start out a little better than that. But, that’s our plan for 2023. Also in 2023, I mean in addition to staying in front of inflation with price, we think supply chain shortages are going to abate. And we believe our working capital levels will decrease to more normalized levels to a very healthy 110% to 115% conversion to net income on the free cash flow. We also think that in terms of vertical markets we do expect our longer cycle aerospace and defense businesses to be a bit stronger than the balance of the portfolio. So, one through the mortgage segment commentary, Deane, it was a little bit higher, was -- had a mid- to-high outlook. So, we think that’s going to be true. And that was accelerating as we -- each quarter of 2022 really. We expect both of our groups to grow mid single digits. We talked about the historically strong backlog. And, that’s some assumptions that went into our budget. Do you have any questions, Brett?
Brett Linzey: No, that’s it. Great quarter, and I appreciate all the insight.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Brett.
Operator: Thank you. And our next questioner today is Scott Graham from Loop. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning all. And really congrats on that Zygo, that’s a pretty big deal.
Dave Zapico: Hey, that’s a really interesting, that's really helping, but that team did a great job. And it’s working on fusion energy is a great thing. And, it just shows our capability.
Scott Graham: Yes, for sure. Thank you. The orders gave you said up 1.5 in the quarter. Was that organic? And can you also tell the split by segment?
Dave Zapico: Yes. That was overall worse. Organic was down minus 2. And so, overall orders were up 1.5. Organic was minus 2. And both segments were about at that same 1:1 book-to-bill. So, wasn’t a distinct difference between the segments, and as I said, overall demand environment showed a solid 10 straight quarter of book-to-bill. So, we have a strong backlog. And as we have this dynamic of customers returning to more normalized ordering patterns, we have a strong backlog. So, we feel pretty good about it.
Scott Graham: Okay, great. Thank you. Based on your answer to the prior question, is it possible then that sales volumes could sort of flatten out in the second half of the year. And your growth organic is essentially all price? Is that what you are what you are thinking cadence wise?
Bill Burke: I don’t think in the second half of the year. I mean we are going to have some healthy price. But I think it’s going to actually increase a bit in the second-half. And, if you think about our order rates we have that mid single digit sales growth forecasted. We think we are going to grow orders also. So, orders are going to grow a little bit less than sales as our forecast. But, they are going to grow. And really by the end of the year, our backlog is still going to be at elevated levels. It will be down a bit, but at elevated levels historically. So, we are clearly done with our strong backlog which will provide a buffer is there is some kind of downturn. We don’t see it right now. And our orders will be up, but it will be up a little less than sales. And again, at the end of 2023, we have historically elevated levels of backlog similar to now.
Scott Graham: Yes, great. Hey, thank you.
Bill Burke: Yes, Scott.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matt Summerville at D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Will Jellison: Hi, good morning. This is Will Jellison on for Matt Summerville today.
Dave Zapico: Hello, good morning.
Will Jellison: I was curious about your recent acquisitions with Navitar and RTDS. And just about your first observations with those companies as part of the AMETEK portfolio. How did things unfold related to expectations? And how are things going with bringing them into the fold?
Dave Zapico: Yes, they are going very well. I mean Bill and I have met with both of the acquisition integration teams and really positive. Just to recap a little bit, RTDS provides real-time power simulations used by utilities and various strategic acquisitions that broadens our power instruments businesses with differentiated testing and measurement and simulation capabilities. So, it's attractive position and high growth market. Really good team, I mean, just experts in the field. And it's kind of fun interacting with them. And they're really adopting AMETEK and feel good about that one. Same with Navitar, Navitar is in some good growth markets. The optics market is doing quite well with us. And even in the semiconductor space, where they play their main customers is one that's very differentiated and has unique capabilities. So, that along with Life Sciences along with machine vision, there's a very good outlook there. And that business is a little bit different as being integrated into our Zygo business. So, it has new capability for Zygo. Much needed capacity for Zygo and the integration is going very well.
Will Jellison: Great, thank you. And then, as a follow-up, staying on the theme of M&A, you mentioned your pipeline is very strong at this juncture. And I'm curious about what your observations are in the market overall, with respect to the level of competition for assets and where multiples seem to be moving in your observation?
Dave Zapico: Right, yes, I think with the interest rates increasing, and with money, not as free as it was, is actually an advantage to us. So, we have a good pipeline and a good balance sheet. And we remain very active with a solid pipeline of deals, the valuations have come in a bit. We're looking at some quality assets, though. So, they're still a bit elevated from historical levels, but no doubt they've come in. And important for us in our pipeline, we have a very disciplined acquisition process. And these deals are going to meet our traditional financial hurdles, which is primarily a return on invested capital of 10% by the third year of ownership. These are important thresholds for us as we want to ensure we're providing a strong level returns on the capital we deploy for our shareholders. And that's been a hallmark of AMETEK's acquisition program for a long period of time. We do this all with cash and debt, don't use equity. And there's a bigger pipeline right now than has been historically because when there's less, less money around the system to bid up deals. So, we feel pretty good with where we're at. And if we do something, and I believe we will be talking to you about deals in the near future, they're going to be, they're going to meet all of our traditional hurdles. And we're committed to have an investment grade credit rating, and we got plenty of about $2.3 billion of capital and financing capacity available. So, in this environment, discipline is going to be a key word as it's always been for AMETEK. But have been very key in terms of executing our forward-looking M&A strategy.
Will Jellison: That's great. Thank you for taking my questions.
Dave Zapico: Yes, okay.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
David Ridley-Lane: Hi, this is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin.
Dave Zapico: Hi, David.
David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. How much of the one-time costs around supply chain disruptions last year, the higher freight costs, the spot buys and electronics, all those things fall-off in 2023? I'm guessing I'm wondering is this a meaningful tailwind in kind of your forecasts?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think that what you're going to see, there's still an elevated level of inflation. But at the same time, some of the one-time distributor purchases of inventory are going to go away. So, there's going to be some natural tailwinds for us in terms of margins, we expect that working in the P&L in our budget model, our productivity/cost savings of about $110 million. So, we think it'll be substantial. And that's where we're starting out the year but we think there's maybe even some upside to that. And it's largely related to a, and there is a couple of opposing forces, you're dealing with inflation and some costs of things are still going up. But at the same time, some of the supply chain issues are working the other way and especially the higher prices that we paid on a one-time basis to some of the electronics distributors to continue shipping products.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it and then you have been adding capacity through 2022, I guess in the CapEx, what's kind of growth versus maintenance or whatever framework you want to use to discuss kind of how you're thinking about capacity additions here in 2022?
Dave Zapico: We added a lot of capacity in 2022, we brought some low cost region facilities online, we've talked about that. For 2023, we expect our capital expenditures to be flat, a little bit more than 2% of sales, as we've done historically. So, and it's a good balance between growth CapEx, maintenance CapEx and CapEx funding cost reductions.
David Ridley-Lane: Then, if I could get one more in, what is your expected EPS contribution from Navitar and RTDS?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I'm not going to break out the deal, but there'll be slightly accretive.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.
Dave Zapico: Okay, thank you, David.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Yes, you mentioned -- you mentioned customers kind of getting normalized on their behavior and their ordering patterns, like, can you maybe get a little bit finer point on that? And like, what you're seeing, are actual things getting pushed out, or are they just ordering more real times?
Dave Zapico: Yes, if you think about it from the customer's view, they've kind of got trained by the pandemic, to order things early. And now, most companies are getting including AMETEK is getting back to being able to deliver in lead time. And in fact, that's part of the reason that we grow our businesses at a faster rate during the pandemic period, we were able to ship and deliver and we had the inventory buffer. So, what's happening is, as customers normalize their buying patterns, they don't have to order early anymore. And that's what's really happening, I think across the broader supply chain, and we're seeing that. So, that's the main normalization that we're talking about.
Joe Giordano: And then when you mentioned the M&A pipeline looks good. How do you think about timing of execution, just given the macro year, given it looks like industrial is getting lighter, is getting weaker and are you relying on trailing 12 results that might be different than forward 12 for acquired for companies that you're looking at. So, how does it impact your desire to do be actionable right now, given where we are in the business cycle?
Dave Zapico: AMETEK has historically bought through both upcycles and down cycles. And sometimes you can get your best deals during a down cycle. And you have to be cognizant of what the forward-looking EBITDA is not really the trailing, but the forward. So, it's something that we've been keenly aware of for years, and we're focused on it.
Joe Giordano: Thanks, guys.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Joe.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Rob Mason of Baird. Please go ahead.
Rob Mason: Yes, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Hello, Rob.
Rob Mason: Hey, Dave. Good morning, good morning. Dave, I'm just going to see if you could drill into the process segment a little more, you called out Ultra Precision with relative stronger growth, does that carry forward into '23 just in terms of what leads that part of the business? And then just maybe higher level anyway to cut the mix of what that process segment, that sales into more of an R&D function versus more of a production environment?
Dave Zapico: Yes, that's a good way to think about it. And I'll try to put some more color into that. I mean, if you look at 2022, what stood out was our healthcare component. And our healthcare component is a big part of process across all of AMETEK, it's about 50% of sales, but it's a big part of the process. And I'll give you an idea. And Q4, our rolling business was up 20% organically, so they're really doing a good job. And that market has -- hospital spending has been fantastic for us, and people were putting in new systems post-pandemic. Also the semiconductor markets about 6% of sales, and the vast majority of that is in process and the semiconductor market was up high single-digits in the Q4. And we think in 2023, there'll be a slight downtick there, that'll be up low-to-mid but still growing because we have a lot of applications and research and also in the areas that are continuing to grow. So, we're in the right places in semiconductor. So, you got healthcare, you got semiconductor. You got the research market where we've had with our CAMECA business just every lab in the world has to have one of our atom probes, every lab in the world has to have some of our SIMS products. So, their backlog is really good. And they're doing well. And then, you got the old traditional oil and gas part of process. And that's doing very well in Q4, it was up high-single-digits. And for all '22, it was up low double-digits. And for '23, we expect plus high-single-digits. So, process is doing very well. And we think it's going to continue in the future.
Rob Mason: Excellent. That's very helpful. Just as a follow-up, could you speak to how you think the incrementals will look for EIG versus EMG, in '23 they were, EMG was certainly very strong in '22. But just how did those look going forward comparatively?
Dave Zapico: Good question. In terms of incrementals, in both groups, I think the core incrementals will be up 30% to 35%. And I think the core and reported margins will be up 30 to 40 Bps. So, we really think we have a clear line of sight to grow margins. Again, there'll be healthy incrementals. And we'll be able to increase our core margins as we go forward.
Rob Mason: Very good. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Rob.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Steve Barger at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steve Barger: Hey, good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Hello, Steve.
Steve Barger: Some automation and robotics OEMs have recently talked about distribution channel bottlenecks being a hindrance to growth, can you just talk about what you're seeing in that market, both near-term and expectations for how that market grows in the future?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think for 2023, we think that business will be at mid-single-digits. And both our automation and our engineering solutions will be up mid-single-digits, I think that we're selling to mainly OEM customers there. So, you're going to have a bit of the effect of the ordering patterns, a change in ordering patterns there, but we have a really healthy backlog. So, it's really what we talked about customers are changing ordering patterns. We're really good at delivery. So, we're meeting our customer commitments, so they're now ordering at normal lead times. So, you'll see a little bit of the order corrections that we talked about in Q4 continuing. But we still have a record backlog and all the comments that I made hold for that part of the business also.
Steve Barger: Got it. Thanks. And obviously semiconductor demand has been under pressure, especially on the memory side. But you just said you're in the right places to grow. That mean, you're supplying the makers of tools that go to foundry and logic or just how will you grow this year in the context of what's a pretty tough memory side?
Dave Zapico: Right, it's pretty tough. And again, we grew mid-teens in 2022. So, that growth for 2023 is up low-to-mid. So, it's a substantial decline. But we're still growing and the reason we're growing the key application areas, at our CAMECA business, they're really involved in semiconductor research and development and staying ahead and getting the next generation. And we have some tools that are must haves for the semiconductor market, and really strong backlogs and orders are continuing well. And then, the second area is we're in the EUV optics area for used in semiconductor fabrication. So, the EUV market is kind of separate from the memory market and really strong. So, those two areas are the good part of our semiconductor business and they're really strong. And that's why we think we'll still be able to grow low to mid-single-digits in an environment where you have some of the headwinds.
Steve Barger: That's great detail. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay, thank you, Steve.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Coleman for any closing remarks.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the AMETEK’s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK’s third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risk and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK’s filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2021 or 2022 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We’ll begin today’s call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we’ll open it up for questions. I’ll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered record results in the third quarter, with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution, leading to earnings above our expectations. Operationally, our businesses are performing exceptionally well and successfully offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in impressive margin expansion. We are also seeing continued strong and broad-based demand across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record backlog of $3.2 billion. And this morning, we announced the acquisition of two excellent businesses, Navitar and RTDS Technologies, expanding our presence in high-end precision optics and in testing solutions for the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly. Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. Now, let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.55 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 11%. Acquisitions added one point and foreign currency was an approximate four-point headwind in the quarter. Demand also remains solid across our niche markets with organic orders growing 9% in the quarter, while book-to-bill was 1.07, our ninth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3.2 billion, up approximately $1.4 billion from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was a record $385 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2021, while operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter, up a robust 140 basis points from the prior year, with strong margin expansion in each operating group. Our ability to drive meaningful margin expansion despite the inflationary environment reflects the differentiation of our technology solutions and our flexible operating model. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record of $463 million, up 12% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins a record 29.8%. This outstanding performance led to a record of earnings of $1.45 per diluted share, up 15% versus the third quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.36 to $1.38. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered excellent operating performance with continued strong and broad-based growth. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.05 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 10% with a 1-point contribution from acquisitions being more than offset by an approximate 3-point foreign currency headwind. Growth was again broad-based across our EIG businesses with particularly strong growth within our Rauland, TMC Precitech and Thermal Process Management businesses. Third quarter operating income was $272.7 million, up 11% versus the prior year. And operating margins were 25.9% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year. The performance of our Electromechanical Group in the quarter was exceptional, with excellent sales growth and record operating results. EMG's third quarter sales were a record $497.7 million, up 8% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 13% in the quarter and foreign currency at four-point headwind. Growth was very broad-based across all of our EMG businesses. EMG's operating income in the third quarter was a record $136.5 million, up 19% compared to the prior year period. EMG's third quarter operating margins were a record 27.4%, up an impressive 240 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter, allowing us to manage an uncertain macro environment, meaningfully expand margins and drive earnings ahead of our expectations. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. We are very pleased to announce the acquisition of two highly strategic businesses. Navitar and RTDS Technologies are both excellent businesses and highly strategic acquisitions for AMETEK, expanding our presence with -- in attractive secular growth markets. Now let me take a moment to provide additional color on both these acquisitions, starting with Navitar. Navitar is a leading provider of optical solutions for critical applications across several markets, including medical and life sciences research, machine vision and robotics, semiconductor and industrial automation. Their comprehensive suite of high-precision, custom optical solutions includes fully integrated imaging systems, sensors, cameras, optics and software. Navitar is an excellent strategic and complementary fit with our Zygo business unit as their technical capabilities around cameras and optical systems further expand Zygo's product offering. Additionally, Navitar is a high-growth business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for precision optical solutions across attractive growth markets. Navitar was privately held and is based in Rochester, New York. Now switching to RTDS Technologies. RTDS provides real-time digital simulation systems used by utilities and research and educational institutions in the development and testing of the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. Their simulation solutions allow engineers to rapidly prototype, verify and test the performance of the electric grid, power instruments and networks and close-looped systems to help accelerate product development life cycles and decreased testing costs. RTDS' simulation solutions are playing a key role in the modernization of the electric grid infrastructure, as well as supporting secular growth drivers, including renewable energy, distributed power generation and energy storage. The acquisition of RTDS broadens our Power Instruments businesses testing and simulation capabilities, while expanding our exposure to the renewable energy space. RTDS is privately held and based in Winnipeg, Canada. We are very excited to welcome the Navitar and RTDS teams to the AMETEK family. We deployed approximately $430 million on these acquisitions, acquiring approximately $100 million in annual sales. Over the past two years, we deployed more than $2.4 billion in capital and acquisitions and acquired eight businesses. Our acquisition pipeline remains solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital on strategic acquisitions. In addition to the recent acquisitions, we continue to focus on ensuring AMETEK is strategically positioned for long-term sustainable growth. Our businesses are driving broader adoption of our organic growth initiatives, including growth presence, digitalization and new product development. This includes making strategic growth investments across our businesses to help support and accelerate growth. For all of 2022, we now expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives. We are seeing great results from these efforts over both the short-term and long-term. In the third quarter, sales from new products introduced over the last three years was 27%, a record level for our Vitality Index, reflecting the great work of our teams. These efforts have helped lead to double-digit organic sales growth in each of the past six quarters. Now, turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. While we remain cautious in the short-term, given the dynamic macro environment, we are highly confident in the quality of our businesses and our ability to manage through these challenging times. Given our strong third quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall and organic sales to be up approximately 10% versus our prior guidance of up high single-digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.63, up 16% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.46 to $5.54 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, overall sales are expected to be up mid-single-digits compared to the same period last year, and fourth quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.47 per diluted share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year. To summarize, AMETEK had another excellent quarter. We delivered record performance, strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, increased our earnings guidance for the year and acquired two strategic businesses. The strength of the AMETEK growth model and our talented global workforce is evident in our results, thus far this year and will continue to allow us to operate at a high level through challenging market conditions. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $3 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense in the quarter. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the third quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $28 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $76 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $310 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18.4% of sales. We generated strong levels of cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $327 million, up 7% versus the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $299 million in the third quarter, up 6% from the prior year and free cash flow to net income conversion was 100%. Total debt ended the third quarter at $2.36 billion, down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $310 million. At the end of the third quarter, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times. As Dave noted, we've been active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we acquired Navitar and subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired RTDS Technologies. Combined, we deployed approximately $430 million on these two acquisitions. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have no material debt maturities due until 2024 and modest levels of leverage. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and a strong balance sheet. Following our two recent acquisitions, we still have over $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our business has performed exceptionally well in the third quarter and through the first nine months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and world-class workforce. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Kate, could we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, maybe could you talk a little bit about the organic performance you saw by geographic region and what, if anything, for lack of a better word, your canary type of businesses might be telling you about the macro environment? And then I have a follow-up.
Dave Zapico: Okay. Yes. Regarding the geographic storyline, it was really strong broad-based growth across all geographies and very balanced growth. I mean the US was up about 11%. We had broad-based growth there, notable performance in our process and automation businesses. The US was the strongest, up 11%. Europe was up 9%, notable strength in process in our aerospace business. And Asia was up 9%, notable strength in our Process businesses. So, no canaries in the coal mine for us. Orders are strong. Sales were strong geographically and all regions showed a solid broad-based growth, very balanced.
Matt Summerville: Got it. And then, Dave, could you maybe comment a little bit on what your price realization was in the third quarter? What your price/cost sort of ratio look like and how we should be thinking about incremental price actions for 2023? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes. In the third quarter, our price continued to more than offset inflation and the pricing was very consistent across our portfolio. Pricing was about 6% and inflation was about 5%. So we had a positive spread of approximately 100 basis points. And we expect a similar price inflation spread for Q4 of 100 basis points. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of our product portfolio and our leadership position in niches. In terms of next year, really not ready to talk about pricing and inflation next year. I will say that, we do expect that we will be able to offset inflation with price in 2023 from a philosophy and an operating capability. But we're going to refrain from discussing 2023 until we get to -- go through our bottoms-up reviews with each of our businesses. So, there's no ranges and think it's not going to be positive next year, but we don't have the data yet. So I'm going to hold off on that one. But really good performance on pricing in Q3, and we expect it to continue in Q4. Did that answer your question, Matt?
Matt Summerville: Very good. Thanks, David.
Dave Zapico: Sure.
Matt Summerville: Yes, it did. Thank you, very much.
Operator: The next question is from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: So Dave, you talked a little bit -- certainly some caution out there. Your orders are really strong. Just maybe give your perspective of this cycle and maybe more importantly, how you think AMETEK's relative position is entering maybe a next downturn prior to relative past cycles? Just any thoughts there?
Dave Zapico: Those are great questions. I mean the -- I think in terms of AMETEK; I think our underlying demand remains strong. As I answered Matt's question, we're not seeing weakness yet. It's really broad-based. Our organic orders are strong. They were up 9%. It was -- both groups had positive organic growth. Both groups are strong. We're growing a healthy growth rates in all major regions of the world as I just went through. And so we feel good about that, and we ended the quarter with a record backlog. So that is really good. And you talk about 2023, I think our portfolio is in much better shape to -- as we're going forward because if you think about what's happened, we've continued to shift our portfolio to exposures in attractive growth markets, growth markets like automation, healthcare, power. This recent acquisition is more renewables. And the market shifts are attractive for us. And our technology, our differentiation is stronger than it was six or seven years ago. And we see that playing out in our organic growth in both relative and absolute performance, we think. And the big picture, we've incrementally improved our portfolio without sacrificing a couple of years of growth to do it and have delivered an exceptional way along the path. I'll give you some examples. Our healthcare portfolio, it was about 10% six years ago. Now, it's 15%. Aerospace and defense, it was about -- it was low double-digits part of the business about six or seven years ago. Now, it's high-teens. Our automation business went from about 7% to 12%. So good improvements in all those areas as a percentage of our total portfolio. And on the flip side, more cyclical businesses like our oil and gas and metals, they were more than 20% of sales six years ago. And right now, combined, these sales are about 8%. So we feel good about the portfolio, and it's performing now and we think it's going to perform in any kind of economic environment that we run into.
Allison Poliniak: Great. That's helpful. And then just on the acquisitions. I know you said at least Navitar, high growth. Could you maybe give a little bit more color on is it -- are the growth of these acquisitions sort of in line with AMETEK a little better? And just any color on the margin performance relative to AMETEK core? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Right, right. I think the -- both acquisitions are going to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. So they're both good growers. And both acquisitions are very profitable businesses. The blended multiple was about 11 times. So both very profitable, growing businesses and a fair price paid. We're excited to have each of these companies, each fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. They're leaders in niche markets, each has very strong technology differentiation positions that are backed by excellent engineering capabilities. And they expand our presence in attractive growth markets. Navitar is in the high-growth optical solutions, in life sciences, machine vision, robotics. And RTDS is really well positioned to benefit from the modernization and electrical power grid and the investments being made there with excellent exposure to the renewables market. So we've been working on these businesses for good period of time, and I'm just really glad to have them in the portfolio.
Allison Poliniak: Great. Thanks, so much.
Dave Zapico: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Dean.
Deane Dray: We touched on it a bit so far in the earlier questions, but maybe just more methodically take us through the key end markets. Sounded like Process, aero were strong. But can you just kind of go from the strongest or the weakest and we'll take it from there. Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Sure, Dean. I'd be glad to do that. The strongest was Process. They had the strongest growth in the third quarter. Organic sales, up low teens on a percentage basis. The growth is really broad-based. And as I said in my prepared remarks, it was particularly strong growth across our Roland Healthcare business, TMC Pressitech and our thermal process management businesses. And for all of 2022, we now expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up approximately 10%. The segment that grew the fast -- second fastest was our Automation & Engineered solutions. Very strong third quarter with organic sales up low double digits, a balanced growth across both Automation & Engineered Solutions. And for that sub-segment, we now expect organic sales to be up approximately 10%, up from high single-digits, up to 10% for the full year with similar growth across each segment. Then, I take you to the Power & Industrial business, up mid-single-digits on a percentage basis in the quarter. We saw a notable strength across our power instruments and programmable power business. And we now expect that sub-segment to grow 10% also. So that was -- we rose that from high single-digits to 10%. And I'll talk about the Aerospace & Defense business. Organic sales for our Aerospace & Defense businesses were up mid-single-digits in the third quarter. Commercial sales were really strong, up mid-teens in the quarter, driven by strong underlying demands across the industry. Commercial OE, aftermarket and business jet all grew nicely. The strongest were aftermarket in business jet. And defense sales were up low single-digits in the quarter. And for the full year, we expect organic sales for A&D to be up high single-digits on a percentage basis with our commercial aerospace business to -- growth to be stronger than the defense growth. That's a walk around the company, Dean.
Deane Dray: That's fabulous. How about just the idea of any changes at the margin in customer buying behavior. In some cases, we've seen as supply chains are normalizing a bit, lead times come in a bit. They don't have to put -- customers will have to give you the bigger orders just to get in line. Is there any kind of change there and maybe share with us the cadence of the quarter in terms of orders?
Dave Zapico: Right. I'll start with the cadence. We had strong orders in each month with the strongest being September. We had a very strong September and for that matter, our October results are consistent with our outlook showing a solid performance. Yes, a good question about the underlying orders. And the way I think about it, we'll certainly be running into more difficult comparisons for order input in the coming quarters. And we do expect our orders to moderate due to the fact that you're talking about, our customers placed orders early due to supply chain dynamics. And we believe that the return to more normalized ordering patterns and -- but even with these factors, I expect our backlog to be in an excellent position as we enter 2023.
Deane Dray: That’s really helpful. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes. No problem.
Operator: The next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Josh.
Bill Burke: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Dave, I want to follow-up on Dean's last question and your last comment about backlog. With supply chain starting to improve and really some of this kind of extra backlog really being more supply side driven than anything else, what would you say is sort of the amount of backlog you think you could convert next year? I guess how should we think about the time frame for getting from where we are today, maybe down to more typical levels because the entire business isn't long cycle, just kind of pockets of it?
Dave Zapico: That's a good question. And the way -- one way that I think about it, it may help you, if you go back a few years, our annual sales were about 30% in backlog. So that was a typical year for us. We had about 30% of annual sales in backlog. Right now, we have a little more than 50% of annual sales in backlog. So there's a 20% difference there. And that's why I think we have solid visibility and that's in place because of the ordering patterns or our customers have changed, and we've had really strong order input and we had to protect our customers with inventory because of the supply chain prices. So, the increase of backlog went from about 30% of annual sales to 50% of annual sales, and that's the kind of way I think about it, that helps you.
Josh Pokrzywinski: That is helpful. I guess how fungible should we think of backlog? So let's say, book-to-bill starts to trend well below one for a couple of quarters between comps and maybe a little bit of a demand slowdown. Are you guys able to pull that in sort of in real time? Or does that have specific dates associated with it where you can't really pull it in as much?
Bill Burke: Yes, Josh, I'd say as you look at the backlog we have, I mean, almost all of it could be shipped -- there'll be a small portion of it that would flip over into 2024. But when you look at what's coming due over the next 12 months, next -- well, really, if you look at it 15 months to get you through the balance of 2023, there's a large portion of it, the great majority of it will ship in the next year.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That’s helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just going back to the acquisitions. I'm guessing these are more North American-centric acquisition. So, just wondering if there's a globalization sort of angle to this? And just want to confirm some numbers. It sounds like these are high 30% EBITDA margins combined. Is there any difference between the two acquisitions? Or would you say they are you quite consistent across both of them? And can they go even higher than that? I mean, are there any sort of easy synergies from supply chain, et cetera, that can actually move the needle on those margins?
Dave Zapico: Yes, you're right about the profitability. They're high profitability businesses. Navitar is maybe -- has a little higher growth rate and a little lower profitability than RTDS that has higher profitability and still is a healthy growth rate, but maybe slower than Navitar's. We -- there's a normal amount of synergy for us in these deals. They're both private businesses and there's excellent opportunities for us to improve the cost and revenue generation capabilities of the business. And there is a globalization theme. RTDS is more globalized already than Navitar, but both of them will benefit from AMETEK's global scale. So, good insight on your part.
Nigel Coe: That's great. And then my follow-on is as we dig into the EMG margins, which were pretty exceptional. Did a disproportionate amount of price cost land in EMG? Or are we seeing some mix impact from commercial aero aftermarket? Any details there would be great.
Dave Zapico: Yes. I mean the -- EMG's performance was excellent in the quarter, as you mentioned. They had record margins of 27.4%. And the biggest factor when you look at it is our higher-margin businesses are growing faster in the quarter in particular. And EMG is pretty much done what AMETEK continues to do and moving up the differentiation curve with their product portfolio. And we exited some of the lower-margin consumer businesses over time. So, they're really good book of business as we go forward up the differentiation curve and they're getting better pricing because of that. But in terms of pricing, it was really broad-based across all of AMETEK. So it wasn't -- EIG and EMG were similar in terms of price. It's really -- if you want to think about it, the -- certain mix effect because the higher-margin businesses grew faster in the quarter.
Nigel Coe: Very clear. Thanks, David.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Scott Graham of Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Hey good morning, David, Bill, Kevin.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Graham: I wanted to talk a little bit more about the backlog, piggyback on to Josh's question. Bill, you indicated, I think it was Bill, that 15 months is kind of like the shippable. So are you also saying that customers can't push that back, that these are sort of contracted shipment dates? What's the dynamic look like there?
Bill Burke: Yes. The reason I took the 15 months was to get us to the end of next year. That's really the point I was making there. And you always have to work with your customers on pushouts or pull-ins. And -- but I think the point I was trying to make is that much of that backlog is due and shippable next year, and we'll work through it. But as Dave said, it's only half of next year's shipments, we're going to continue to book orders and be able to ship against those.
Scott Graham: Okay. So when you say you talked about -- talked with customers about this, there is a chance that some of these things could be pushed out a quarter or two?
Bill Burke: Yes.
Dave Zapico: Yes. Yes. And it's a typical business. I mean, there -- it's a firm backlog backed by firm POs, but we work with our customers on both pull-ins and push-outs and inevitably, that happens every quarter.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you. My other question is around acquisitions. So two deals, it's been quiet this year, at least. So, maybe is this a situation hopes brings eternal? Is it -- are you starting to see bid-ask spreads close in to a point where there might be an acceleration? Or was this just something that a couple of deals? And I'm asking the question because it's two, it's not one, right? Right. So what does that mean for like the next six months, do you think?
Dave Zapico: When I look at our backlog and deals and potential deals, I feel very optimistic that over the next, say, 12 months, we're going to be able to deploy our free cash flow and acquisitions. We -- the pipeline is very, very strong. There's a -- we're working with quite a few businesses right now and actively exploring some exciting opportunities. So can we have the financing to do it? I mean the pricing is starting to come in on deals now and our relative position versus some other competitive buying, like private equity has improved. So I'm looking -- I'm pretty optimistic about deals for 2023. And our backlog is going to support and our balance sheet supports, strong cash flow support it. So it's going to be a big part of the future AMETEK story.
Scott Graham: So you're saying, Dave, you're confident that over the next 12 months, you can deploy 100% of your free cash flow on deals?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I believe that to be true.
Scott Graham: Great. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi, thanks.
Dave Zapico: Hey, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: My question is -- hey, on at Navitar. I don't know if you can expand on the niches they participate in. And the reason for the question is just there's some very large changes in the way the world's working with reshoring with investment battery factories and semiconductor factories in North America and so on. And I'm wondering about that historical growth rate, future growth rate and where they really attack and whether that's helped by some of the ongoing investments?
Dave Zapico: Right. Yes. I think some of the reshoring is going to help them. I mean the largest market segment is in the medical and life sciences area, where they're very -- they have very successful penetration in the optics used in various types of microscopes. There are also -- their optics are very, very good, and they're in a lot of machine vision and robotics applications. They sell to some big name semiconductor companies at the high-end of the market. And we just think the combination of this business with our Zygo business, that's the primary optical business, just puts it together and gives us some additional tools to go to our customers with. And it's -- and I'm very optimistic on the future and very low-risk deal for us.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay. Great. And if I may, can I ask the same sort of question on RTDS with some of the upcoming changes to Power Grids, maybe that's a longer-term…
Dave Zapico: Yes.
Rob Wertheimer: …situation, but I don't know if you're seeing opportunity and inflection there.
Dave Zapico: We are. And I think we got this business at the right time because as people put renewable energy on the grid and whether it's a wind farm or a field of solar panels, or on the electrification, they have charging devices for electric vehicles, each one of those things that they add to the grid is not simple. There has to be a lot of analysis done and they have to understand the impact of -- they're adding to the grid. And at the same time, there's a lot of investment in the grid. Some of the infrastructure act is putting investment in the grid. And RTDS is really used to help simulate and modernize the grid. So they have a high market share and they're used by all the utilities to understand what's going to happen with modernizing their electric grid. So, they're really well positioned for the future. And they have an excellent team of technical people. So we're optimistic on what that business can do with under AMETEK.
Rob Wertheimer: Great. Thank you for the answers.
Dave Zapico: Okay.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Andrew Obin: Hey guys, good morning. Can you hear me?
Dave Zapico: Yes. Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Just a question on RTDS. As you guys move into more software, I know some of your peers as they were making a transition, you try to apply the business system, but how do you fit something like churn into your framework and to optimizing the business. Clearly, you have an amazing playbook for integrating assets and taking the margins up. How do you apply your playbook to a more digital asset like RTDS? And what adjustments have you had to make because that seems very interesting? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes. In the case of RTDS, it's like many AMETEK businesses. It's a combination of hardware and then software to operate the business. So it's really not different, and it's not a software-only business. And we've largely stayed away from software-only businesses because the pricing has been very high, and we couldn't get a good return on it. And to your point, we don't see the synergy that we'll add to the businesses. So -- but at the same time, software is very important to AMETEK. It's in these combined systems, very complex hardware systems that need software, and that's our specialty and RTDS gets right into that.
Andrew Obin: No, that's a great way to get smart on software. And then another question for you. Are there any businesses where AMETEK has added capacity or has plans to add capacity, given what's happening out there? Just to follow-up on some of the questions were asked before.
Dave Zapico: Yes. We have -- we're bringing on a lot of capacity in low-cost regions. And we -- during this year, I mean, we've expanded our facilities in Mexico. We expanded our facility in Serbia. We expanded our facility in Malaysia. And we have more in the works, but those were all put in place this year to add additional capacity. So we're dealing with our volume in low-cost regions, and it provides a synergy to -- and local market access for us. So, we've been investing heavily in low-cost production manufacturing. And Malaysia is becoming a good facility for us. Again, Eastern Europe, Serbia and Mexico for the US. So it's -- we have these regional hubs that we're building up, and it's very successful for us. And we've put a lot of capacity in place this year.
Andrew Obin: Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glynn: Thank. Good morning, Dave, Bill, Kevin.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn: Was curious about the Vitality Index, 27%, a record level. I think that ties into some of the discussion on the EMG margins. But is there a level you think of it as a mature level of vitality for the business? And I don't mean that as a negative, but you've got an entrenched market for a lot of your products and I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about that.
Dave Zapico: Yes. The first thing is not only is the Vitality Index, it helps us with our pricing, because we're continually adding new features and benefits to our products and our customers, and it enables us to garner a higher price because of the engineering investment that we're making, very consistent engineering investment over 5% over many years. We first started tracking the Vitality, it was in the mid-teens. And over the past 10 or 15 years, it got into the 20s and the mid-20s. And now, I'm just very pleased with 27% Vitality. Clearly, our new product development process is working. We're developing products our customers want to buy. And 27% of sales for our end markets, we think that's a really good number. And in general, I put a range around it, I think between 20% and 30% is a very good number for AMETEK. And again, the vitality helps not only from new products, having fresh new products that you can win share with, but it also helps with pricing -- realized pricing.
Christopher Glynn: Great. Thanks. And then I just wanted to go into the process markets a little bit. It's -- you called out some of your brands. I'm curious if you're seeing any particular inflection in certain end markets or applications really stepping out whether it's leaning towards capacity investments or maybe modernizations?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I would say the -- strong across the board and process, but the healthcare space and the energy space are two areas that stood out in the quarter. And then with TMC Precitech, it's just a precision technology where we're doing things that other people can't do and -- our orders have been high for multiple quarters. Now, the sales are catching up.
Christopher Glynn: Great. Thanks for the color.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: The next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Please go ahead.
Dave Zapico: Hi, Joe.
Tristan Margot: Hey, guys, good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'd like to go back to Allison's question a little bit and maybe ask it a little bit differently. But if we were to have an industrial recession, the likes of 2016, for example, how do you think your current portfolio would fare versus your portfolio six years ago? Just trying to get a sense of the magnitude there. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes. I mean it's difficult to understand the specifics until you're in a recession because they're all different. But as I said, I think our portfolio has been improved dramatically. And I think that when you think about all the other things that I mentioned, we would stay in front of inflation with pricing. I think in 2023 as the supply chain shortages abate, we believe our working capital will decrease to a more normalized level. In the vertical markets, I'm going to wait and see what we learn from our businesses but we do expect our longer cycle businesses to be strong in both A&D and energy, and we do expect to have a historically strong backlog when we enter 2023. And in terms of a recession playbook, let's say we do see slowing and we start to see a recession, we'll react and manage our business appropriately as we have done in the past. And we think we have a proven model that works well in both up markets and down markets. And the most recent example of this was during the COVID-driven recession in 2020. And if you look at how we performed through that, despite the weakness in sales during the time, our margins actually grew 80 basis points and decremental margins were only 17%. So we've got the capability to manage in both up cycles and down cycles. And I believe that the next recession will be no different whenever it comes.
Tristan Margot: Awesome. That’s all I had. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Great. Thank you again, Kate, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our conference call. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Have a great day.

Later, we will conduct the question and answer session [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Coleman, you may begin.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Richard. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2021 or 2022 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another excellent quarter, with stronger-than-expected organic sales growth, outstanding operating performance, robust margin expansion and record earnings. Importantly, demand remains strong and broad-based across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record $3.1 billion backlog. Given our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2022, we have increased our earnings guidance for the year. Now let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were a record $1.51 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 12%. Acquisitions added a point and foreign currency was a 3-point headwind in the quarter. Organic orders were up a very strong 11%, despite a highly challenging prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.09 in the second quarter, our eighth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. Operating income in the quarter was a record $365 million, a 15% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.1% in the quarter, up 130 basis points from the prior year with strong incremental margins. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $444 million, about 15% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 29.3%. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up 20% versus the second quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30, driven by stronger-than-expected sales and excellent operating performance. Now let provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.03 billion, up 10% from last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 12% in the quarter, with foreign currency headwinds more than offsetting acquisition contributions. Organic growth remains very strong across our EIG businesses with particularly impressive growth across our Ultra Precision Technologies and P&I division. EIG's operating performance was impressive, resulting in record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter. Second quarter operating income was $265.1 million, up 70% versus the prior year and operating income margins were 25.8% in the quarter. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $486.3 million, up 7% versus the prior year with organic sales growing 11% in the quarter. EMG's growth was also broad-based, with strong growth across both our EMIP and automation businesses. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was $124.4 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second margins were excellent at 25.6%, up 70 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, outstanding results in the quarter, reflecting the quality of our differentiated businesses, the strength of our operating model and the tremendous efforts of our employees. I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your commitment to AMETEK and for the many important contributions you make to our sustained success. Now let me touch on the supply chain. Overall, the global supply chain remains constrained, with the largest challenging -- challenges continuing to be the availability of electronic components. As we noted previously, we have strategically decided to hold additional inventory of select components to support the strong customer demand and as a hedge against the tight supply chain. Additionally, AMETEK's global sourcing teams are doing an outstanding job working to identify additional sources of supply. While these supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation, we have been able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread again this quarter and outstanding margin expense. The combination of our global supply chain capabilities and pricing power provides us the confidence in our ability to manage through these uncertain times. During our first quarter earnings call, we noted that the COVID driven lockdowns across parts of China were expected to delay some China sales from the second quarter into the second half of the year. These lockdowns caused less impact on the business in the quarter than we anticipated. Due to the excellent efforts of our China team, we were able to operate in a closed loop system and adjust our logistics and supply chain networks to support production and shipments. Additionally, during the last two weeks of the quarter, as restrictions were lifted, we were able to resumed multi-ship production and recover much of the delayed shipments. The impact of China's zero-COVID policy is something we are closely watching as we need to react and adjust in the future. Thank you to our entire team in China for your tremendous commitment and resilience during this time. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. Our top priority for capital allocation remains the value-enhancing strategic acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline is very strong. Our business unit and corporate development teams are busy managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. As Bill will highlight in a moment, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow providing us with meaningful capacity to support our acquisition strategy, and we expect to be active in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on driving higher levels of organic growth by consistently investing in our businesses to support their strategic growth initiatives. We're seeing the benefits of these investments in stronger organic growth. Our investments in research, development and engineering continues to yield advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. One measure of the success of these efforts is our vitality index, which was a very strong 26% of sales in the second quarter. This level of vitality reflects our business' ability to develop new products aligned with compelling growth opportunities. One example of this is AMETEK's expansion into the high-growth areas of precision optics. AMETEK's Zygo business, based in Middlefield, Connecticut, provides leading-edge extreme precision optics for the design and protection of very large complicated aspheric lenses. These capabilities supported the manufacture of 18 hexagonal-shaped mirrors, which make up the James Webb Space Telescope's primary mirror. The James Webb Telescope very recently produced the deepest and sharpest infrared images of the deep universe. Truly amazing images due in part to Zygo's capability. Zygo also provides advanced optical systems for use in the next generation of semiconductor production equipment. Their incredibly precised mirrors are playing an important role in supporting the development of EUV extreme ultraviolet optics, for the next generation of semiconductor technologies. Just two of the many examples across AMETEK of the unique and highly differentiated capabilities and technologies we provide our customers. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the second quarter, continued solid order momentum and record backlog, we have increased our full year earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up high single digits, with organic sales now also expected to be up high single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid-to high single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.46 to $5.54, up 13% to 14% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.34 to $5.44 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we expect overall sales to be up in the high single digits compared to the same period last year, and third quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.38 per diluted share, up 8% to 10% versus the prior year. While we are closely monitoring the various macroeconomic headwinds, we are not seeing slowing in our businesses as demand remains solid and our businesses are operating level. We are confident in our ability and improved outlook for the year, given our strong backlog, ability to offset inflation with price increases and outstanding operating capability. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses are well positioned with differentiated technology solutions serving a diverse set of growing niche markets. Our organic growth initiatives are driving higher levels of growth, and our portfolio is aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets. Additionally, our asset-light business model and strong cash flow provides us the flexibility to navigate challenging environments, while continuing to deploy capital and drive increased shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the second quarter led by strong sales and orders growth and tremendous operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million, up $2 million from the prior year. And as a percentage of total sales was 1.6%, in line with the second quarter of 2021. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 18.5%, down from 20.6% in the second quarter of 2021. The lower rate this quarter was driven by lower tax on foreign income. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million for the full year, or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $77 million. And for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $315 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter, operating working capital was 18% of sales. Operating cash flow was $236 million and free cash flow was $210 million in the second quarter. We expect approximately 100% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year. Our working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add select inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and to hedge against the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.44 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $173 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares, for a total of $330 million. As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. Total debt ended the second quarter at $2.5 billion, down slightly from the $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $349 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times. As Dave noted, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2024, modest levels of leverage and strong cash flows. As a result, we are well positioned to deploy meaningful capital investment in our acquisition strategy with approximately $2.3 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To conclude, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, delivering strong sales growth, outstanding operating performance and a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned going into the back half of the year, and we'll continue to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Bill. Richard, could we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question on the line comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Just going back to you, and obviously, very strong orders. You mentioned you're really not seeing any slowing. But has there been any change in the cadence intra-quarter in terms of what you're seeing coming in, whether region or end market? Just any color there?
David Zapico: Yes. I mean we had strong orders each month of the quarter with the strongest month being June, so pretty typical. And we just ended July, and our results were strong in July and very consistent with our outlook. So there's really continue order strength that was -- we had strength in both groups. EIG was up 11 and EMG was up 9. Overall, organic growth was up 11. We're growing at healthy rates in all major regions of the world. All subsegments that we operate in are growing nicely. So it feels pretty good from where we sit. In addition to that, we have, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a record backlog of $3.1 billion, and that's up about 80% from just to -- prior to the start of the COVID pandemic. And we're feeling good, and we're not seeing any weakness anywhere right now.
Allison Poliniak: And then there was obviously a step-up in inventory again this quarter sequentially. I suspect that's due to some of the orders that you're seeing coming in. How should we think about inventory level as we look to the back half of the year? Is it stabilized? Or is it really just dependent on the orders coming in and some of that supply chain issues that are still out there?
Bill Burke: Yes, I think you've hit on it there, Allison. We've got -- with the strong order rate coming in, we've got to make sure we have the inventory to support those orders. And we are still concerned about supply chain, and we're going to continue to react to that. So I would say you've hit the nail on the head, and I think we've increased them now. And we'll continue to manage it closely. Obviously, you know we're very focused on running lean, but we've got to make sure we're supporting the orders that are in place.
Operator: Our next question on line comes from Mr. Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Just I guess first question on Europe. I guess the totality of AMETEK is doing well. You mentioned the orders growth. Anything, I guess, underneath the surface or a KPI that you're watching there? Because obviously, more than macro challenges, things like energy costs just up a lot. Just wondering any way that, that's manifesting itself in your business?
David Zapico: Last quarter, orders were up 9% in Europe. And we had notable strength in our automation and aerospace businesses, and the aerospace businesses really started to accelerate. So it feels pretty good from a demand perspective right now, but with the geopolitical things going on in Russia and Ukraine and the fuel costs in Germany, we're certainly looking -- watching that very closely as that may be a sign of the first place for it to turn down for us. But right now, it's not. And Europe is strong, and we had a good quarter there. Again, Europe was up 9%.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: And then -- just on the aerospace & defense side. I think a lot of supply chain bottlenecks starting to get worse in there. Not necessarily for the stuff that you guys are producing, but are you seeing that at all either in your supply chain or being told by your customers to kind of throttle back delivery because they're waiting for some other component to come in and don't want to just kind of be building gliders or accumulating inventory in the meantime?
David Zapico: I mean, right now it’s quite the opposite. Our orders in our aerospace & defense business were up low double digits in the quarter. Our commercial business was up stronger, and it grew mid-teens and the strongest growth within the commercial aftermarket. And defense market was up low single digits for us, better than in the first quarter. So we're looking at a very strong second half, and most of the interactions we have with our customers are asking us for more. So we're not seeing any slowdown in demand or anything. And I think that market is because of pent-up demand has got a long cycle of growth ahead of it.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Then just one more question if you don't mind. What was price in the quarter?
David Zapico: Right. So in the second quarter, our price continued to more than offset inflation. Pricing was about 6% and inflation was about 5% of sales. So we maintained about 100 basis point spread. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership position in niche markets. And we think about it as we had 6% volume growth and 6% price growth and 12% organic growth. So we think it was a really good quarter from that viewpoint.
Operator: Our next question on line comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: I certainly echo those comments. So just on the third quarter outlook for mid-single-digit sales growth in context of 12% this quarter. Just wondering, especially with the order rates pretty strong as well, what's covering that mid-single-digit outlook? I'm just wondering if we should be looking at the upper end of the mid-singles if you can be a bit more specific there.
David Zapico: If you dig into it, the guide actually reflects mid-to high single digits because we have some currency headwinds. And really, quarter three is kind of a carbon copy of quarter two. And we have a little bit of seasonality in quarter three because of the European exposure. But the difference between quarter two and quarter three, we're expecting a little higher tax rate. So we would consider it appropriately conservative, but there are some dynamics with tax sequentially and the organic rate is mid-to-high. So it's not mid currencies holding us back a bit.
Nigel Coe: And the comp is tougher, but I think if you just comp adjust it, 12% goes to maybe 9%. So just wondering if that was how you sort of manage. And then on the margins, it's obviously very strong. It seems like price cost is at least neutral to margin rates, not dollars, but margin rates. Can you just maybe confirm that? And then just wondering if there's any geographic impact from -- obviously, Europe is pretty strong, but was there any geo impacts to the margin this quarter?
David Zapico: No. I mean, when I look at the margins for the whole business, it was up 130 basis points as reported and 140 basis points core. So you really see strong flow-through through price. And when you look at total cost of sales, I think the margins improved there. EMG -- strong in both groups, EMG margins were up 70 basis points and EIG margins were up 150 basis points as reported, and we had very healthy core incrementals of 40% and reported 38 core incrementals of 38%, 40%. So it feels like we're more than offsetting inflation with price, and we're getting margin expansion. So I think it's a great margin story. And our teams are really executing in their business as well.
Operator: Our next question on line comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho Americas.
Brett Linzey: First question is just on inventories and more channel inventories. I know a lot of your businesses tend to be two to three linkages, upstream from end use or final assembly. Just curious what level of visibility you might have into some of those value chains and your assessment versus those levels relative to end demand?
David Zapico: Yes. If you think about our Electronic Instruments Group, we're largely selling 10 users there. So we have a good view of the end user and our products are customized. So we don't have the problem of people double ordering they're going to be over ordering, but they're not ordering to put stuff on the shelf just in case because of your expensive customized, highly engineered products. When you think about our EMG business, that has more of a -- we're back on the food chain a couple of levels like you talked about. And you could have a backup there, but we're not seeing it right now, and it's indicated by our strong orders growth. So it feels like we're in the right areas and demand is still growing, and we're pretty optimistic about the second half of the year.
Brett Linzey: And then just back to price cost. So price 6%. How are you thinking about some of the wraparound price into early '23 based on some of the mid-year actions? And just curious on price cost, what that might look like in terms of a tailwind as we get into '23 and what the kind of volume or incrementals or decrementals could look like for the algorithm for '23?
David Zapico: Right. It's a little early to start talking about 2023, but the same pricing strategy that we've employed will continue. When we think about the second half of the year, we want to maintain that 100 basis point spread that we had in the second quarter. So the difference between 6% and 5% of sales is 100 basis points. We want to continue that. And second half of the year, and the future pricing is going to be a big part of our budget discussions, and we think inflation is going to be here for a while. So that's going to influence our thought process. So I would expect to main positive spread into next year also.
Brett Linzey: And just a quick follow-up. Would you say the complexion of a lot of your pricing actions is more list normal course versus surcharges? Or anything you can share there?
David Zapico: It's a combination of both. I mean it's list, but in a lot of situations, there are -- we're tied to certain indexes and for shipping and things like that where commodities there could be a retracement a bit, but most of it is in the base price. So we try to get it in base price. But in some situations, it's obvious, it's transparent with your customer, and you have to give it back when things go down. But at the same time, we're saying we'll maintain that 100 basis point spread for the second half of the year.
Operator: Our next question on line comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.
Jeffrey Sprague: I just want to talk about the kind of the deals that were done last year that have sort of kind of anniversary here in the last month or two or three. How they're performing now as they kind of last year and our anniversary into the portfolio? And any change in your view of kind of the accretion outlook for those businesses?
David Zapico: No. I think the outlook for all the businesses is positive, and we're really pleased to have bought them all. And the management teams are now getting embedded into AMETEK. I'd make a -- the business has had the same problems with supply chain that we experienced across our businesses, and those problems were more experienced in the Electronic Instruments Group. They were impact us a lot. And -- but the second half of the year, we took the opportunity to realign those businesses, get them integrated into AMETEK. And for the second half of the year, I really think we're going to have some significant momentum in H2 related to those deals. So we made a lot of progress during the first year. And I think, into the second half of this year and also 2023, I really see significant momentum.
Jeffrey Sprague: And I missed the first couple of minutes of the call, David. Did you say anything about kind of the current deal pipeline or kind of potential actionability on things as you look here into the balance of the year?
David Zapico: No, that's a good question, Jeff. I mean we remain very active. We mentioned that in our prepared remarks. We're looking at multiple deals. As always, we're focused on long-term returns. One of the things I'm excited about is our debt profile. About 86% of our debt is long term and fixed at a 3.2% interest rate. So if there's a -- if interest rates rise, it's really going to have limited effect on us. As Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have no debt maturities in the next couple of years. We recently upsized our revolver. So we're in a very good position to be in terms of executing our M&A strategy. And as I said, our pipeline is strong, and I expect you'll be hearing from us in the second half of the year regarding M&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question on the line comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Just another question on price and volume. In terms of your guide raise, how much of it was price and how much was better volumes in the second half? And I appreciate that there is a FX headwind there as well.
David Zapico: Yes. So, we're not giving that information out. It's really tough to understand that. What we're saying is we'll maintain a spread of 100 basis points positive. And it's a very complicated when you take into account FX and our different mix of businesses and what's happening in the market with some commodity starting to come down. So -- but what we're saying is we'll maintain a 100 basis point spread between price and inflation in the second half of the year.
Andrew Obin: And just to follow up on Jeff's question on M&A. You have a sort of bottoms up a lot of your M&A activity is sort of bottoms up in the organization. Are you hearing anything new from your business units as they chase these market leaders? Do you take a look at stacks? Are you seeing private equity back away, any change in behavior, anything different about this market versus where we were maybe 6 to 12 months ago?
David Zapico: Yes. The -- I mentioned in a prior call that the multiples were very high. And for quality assets, they're still attracting a bit of a premium. But the multiples between public and private markets are coming in, they're coming closer together. And if you have to go and finance a deal and AMETEK can pay from its balance sheet, it gives us an advantage right now because there is some difficulty in getting financing impacting some private equity potential buyers and sellers for that matter.
Operator: Our next question on line comes from Mr. Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson.
Will Jellison: This is Will Jellison on for Matt Summerville. So on the call, you mentioned the supply chain actions that you're taking, including some supply diversification. And I was wondering, bigger picture across the last year plus of supply chain challenges you faced. Are there any best practices that you've learned about throughout the organization that you would want to sustain even when supply chains reach more normalized levels in the future?
David Zapico: It's a great question. And I think we learned several things. We learned that -- our business model is fundamentally sound because our distributed business model, having those committed P&L managers running their business units, they really drive their businesses and there's a good interaction between them and the centralized corporate supply chain team. We also learned that our engineering capability is first rate, and they saw shortages through redesign and qualified component substitutions through this whole time. We did probably one thing that will change is how we purchase electronics going forward. We're looking for -- to leverage our spend more and develop closer relationships with both the semiconductor chip manufacturers and the distributors for that matter. So it will be a little bit of a change in that area. That's one thing I can put to. We're being more direct as opposed to relying on distribution. But fundamentally, it's navigating through this as we did, dealing with these challenges, we've had excellent results. And it's -- as I said, key from my view is our distributed business model. We have people owning these businesses and making good decisions. And our strong engineering capability is also a key factor to help us solve these shortages and redesigning, find qualified component substitutions. So -- did that answer your question?
Nigel Coe: Yes, that was great. And absolutely. And then as a follow-up, I was wondering to the point that you made about having content on the James Webb Telescope, I was wondering if events like that, that are highly visible of historic nature, do those start to meaningfully increase the visibility of what a business like Zygo offers to the extent that it catalyzes more orders than you might otherwise have?
David Zapico: I think in the research community, it really stands out and it does drive customers to us. And the other thing I mentioned in the EUV market, designing and developing optics there there's really only a couple of people that can do it. So Zygo already well known. But those type of events do help us, and they drive customers to us because they see our expertise. And it also is positive for our employees to see that kind of thing and how we're improving the world. So it does help, and we have a lot of businesses like that around AMETEK.
Operator: Our next question online comes from Mr. Joe Giordano from Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Just curious, just the way you guys are set off. Like when we think about the chips, what does that have to -- how do you think about the impact? Are you kind of agnostic as to where a plant is built globally? Or is this helpful that the U.S. isn't incentivizing it specifically?
David Zapico: Yes. I'd say in general, we're agnostic. Wherever it's built in the world, we're going to have our shot at it. But what's happening now is there's probably going to be some incremental capacity put in to satisfy things like security and national defense. And with more opportunities, we'll certainly get a fair share of our business there.
Joe Giordano: And then, Dave, can you go through kind of like any changes in the outlook by market?
David Zapico: Yes, I think on our process businesses, organic sales for process were up low double digits in the quarter. They had a very broad-based growth across essentially all process businesses. And growth in the quarter was particularly strong across Taylor Hobson, Zygo, and our fluid analysis businesses. And you take that all in, and now we're expecting organic sales for process businesses to be up high single digits. So we raised that. Aerospace & defense. Organic sales for our aerospace & defense businesses were up low double digits growth across each segment. Total commercial sales were up mid-teens in the quarter, with strong growth across commercial OEM and aftermarket, and defense sales were up low single digits. So stronger in commercial, but defense was growing also. And for the full year, we now expect organic sales to be up high single digits for our A&D businesses with growth in both commercial and also defense. And if you look at our power power & industrial businesses, excellent in the quarter, up mid-teens on a percentage basis with notable strength in our grammable power business. And we now expect organic sales in our power & industrial business to be up high single digits. So that was raised also. And then finally, our automation & engineered solutions, a really solutions, both seeing strong growth. And we raised the year for that segment also to be high single digits. So we're reflecting the strength of our businesses and an improved organic guide for the rest of the year. And really all those subsegments are now forecasted to grow at high single digits.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Graham from Loop Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Yes, so thanks for doing that just now. You saved me a question. Dave, can you just give us the productivity number in the quarter and the expectation for the year?
David Zapico: Yes. Cost savings in the quarter was $35 million. So a really good quarter. And we're getting a lot of that through value engineering. We're redesigning some of these things and getting them designed at a lower cost level. So that's helping us a lot. And for the year, the cost savings number is $125 million.
Scott Graham: No change there?
David Zapico: No change. About half of it's OpEx and half of it's materials.
Scott Graham: You went through a longer sort of acquisition response than I've heard you before. It sounds to me like you're even signaling that more than even expect second half deals. Could you kind of -- is this a situation where things have just sort of been lined up at the gate and there's there's going to be a couple of different closings of deals? Do you think perhaps your comment was directed more at One in particular, just I mean, how close are we on; some? Did we lose any? Just maybe a little bit more color on what you're thinking on the second half.
David Zapico: Yes. You never can tell with deals, Scott. And things can happen and things can change. But I feel really confident right now because the volume of deals that we're looking at and processing and having some positive interactions are high. And they're both the typical deals that AMETEK has and there are some that are on the bigger size within the constraint of the types of deals we look at. So the -- we're busy with deals. We're busy, and we get -- our people are real busy. And the situation that I talked about with our strong balance sheet, the fixed debt, the strong cash flow, we think that's going to be a differentiator for us as we look into the second half of the year.
Scott Graham: Just one more, if I may. The unbundling of the organic and for the full year, the digits really for all four. Could you tell us of those for which ones are maybe a little bit more that you're optimistic on in the second half? Because obviously, in the second quarter, you did better than we all expected on organic. So sort of how much of those raises were because the second quarter was better versus what you're seeing in the second half?
David Zapico: Good question. In general, we had a good second quarter across the board. The one area that I'd point out is the order growth rates in the commercial aerospace market were one of the things that caught my attention. So I'm looking for some positives there in the second half of the year and into 2023.
Operator: Next question on line comes from Mr. Brett Hardman from Melis Research.
Brett Hardman: So you've already given good color on price cost, but I just wanted to get more of a sense on what you're seeing in terms of cost inflation, in particular in your outlook going forward. Sorry if I missed this, but inflation impact was 4% last quarter, 5% this quarter. You said supply chain is so bad for electronic components in particular, and that inflation will be here for a while. But I'm just wondering, do you expect the inflation impact in general across your business to continue to increase? Or is it sort of plateauing or decreasing as we move through the rest of the year?
David Zapico: Yes, that's a good question. What you really see is some things are coming back in, decreasing in price like inflation, like the commodities. But at the same time, you have wages and other areas that are increasing. So the net effect is inflation is still increasing. It went from 4% to 5% sequentially in the quarter. Right now, I think that's going to stabilize at that, but it's difficult to predict. That's why we have things in place. We're going to maintain that 100 basis points positive spread. But clearly, there are different dynamics that are happening right now where some things are coming back in and some things are still inflating, but the net is still increasing costs. So -- but we've got a good system to manage that, but that may change over the next quarter, and we'll tell you about it. But right now, that's where it is.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you again, Richard, and thanks, everyone, for joining our conference call today. As a reminder, a replay of today's webcast may be accessed in the investor section of ametek.com. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 AMETEK Earnings Conference Call. My name is John and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Now I will turn the call over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, John. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's first quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today’s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2021 or 2022 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
David Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the first quarter with strong sales growth and excellent operating performance, driving robust core margin expansion and earnings which exceeded our expectations. We are also seeing continued strong demand. This demand remains broad based across our diverse set of niche markets, leading to outstanding orders growth and a record backlog. I'm very proud of the way our teams are managing a challenging and uncertain macro environment. AMETEK's flexible operating model allows our businesses to quickly adjust and adapt to changing economic conditions and deliver exceptional results. Before I provide more details on the results for the quarter, I wanted to comment on the ongoing geopolitical events in Ukraine. We are deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine. Our hearts and thoughts are with all those affected. To assist with the immediate needs of this mass humanitarian crisis, the AMETEK Foundation has made donations to several charities that are actively providing food, shelter and medical supplies to those impacted. Additionally, many AMETEK colleagues and our businesses have mobilized to help in whatever way they can through donations to charities supporting the crisis. Thank you to all employees who are supporting those in need. Now let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.46 billion, up 20% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 14%, acquisitions added 7 points and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind in the quarter. Overall orders in the first quarter were $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up 18% in the quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.17 in the first quarter, reflecting continued robust and broad based demand. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3 billion, up approximately $1.2 billion from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was $353 million, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.2% in the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins were 25.5%, up an impressive 140 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021 with strong core margin expansion in each operating group. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating capability and the great work of our teams in managing inflationary and supply chain impacts across our business. EBITDA in the first quarter was $434 million, up 22% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins up 29.7%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.33 per diluted share, up 24% versus the first quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.24 to $1.28. Next, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $987.8 million, up 25% from last year's first quarter. Organic sales were up 15% in the quarter, while recent acquisitions contributed 11%, and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. Organic growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies division with Creaform, Reichert Technologies and TMC Precitech businesses leading the growth. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $244.8 million, up 80% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter. EIG's core margins were up a very strong 130 basis points over the prior year to 27.5%. The Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter with excellent organic sales growth driven by broad based demand and strong operating performance. EMGs first quarter sales increased 11% versus the prior year to $470.8 million. Organic sales growth was 12% and foreign currency a 1 point headwind. Demand within our automation businesses remains excellent reflecting AMETEK's highly differentiated motion control capabilities and leadership positions within our niche applications. EMG's operating income in the first quarter was a record $128.2 million, up 22% to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 250 basis points, just 27.2% which includes an approximate $7 million gain on the sale of a facility in the quarter. On a quarter basis excluding this gain, EMG margins were up a very strong 100 basis points versus last year's first quarter. Our teams continue to deliver outstanding performance in a very challenging and dynamic operational environment. In addition to ensuring we successfully navigate the current macro environment, we are focused on ensuring AMETEK is positioned for long-term success and sustainable growth by making investments in our organic growth initiatives. In 2022, we expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives, including strong growth across our Research, Development and Engineering Groups. AMETEK's leadership positions in our niche markets are driven by deep industry expertise, and the differentiation of our technology. Our research and engineering teams do a wonderful job developing innovative, next generation products and technologies to support their customers applications. For the full year, we now expect to invest more than $345 million or over 5.5% of sales in RDE. Our vitality index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past three years, was a very strong 26% in the first quarter. One way we recognize and celebrate the great work of our businesses new product development efforts is through the AMETEK Innovation Award. This award provided annually to the AMETEK businesses who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded growth opportunity. The most recent innovation award winner was our Hughes-Treitler/Rotron business unit, a leading provider of advanced thermal management systems for use in support of critical aerospace, defense, industrial and commercial applications. Utilizing various elements of the AMETEK new product development process, the team developed a highly innovative heat exchanger that provides meaningful improvements in aircraft engine performance versus the incumbent technologies. This new product will deliver strong incremental sales for AMETEK while providing important sustainability benefits through the reduction of approximately 1 million tons of carbon dioxide over a 10-year period due to an advanced, more thermally and aerodynamically efficient design of the heat exchanger. Driving such benefits aligned with AMETEK's core value of social responsibility by using innovative solutions to help our customers create a more sustainable future. Congratulations to the Hughes-Treitler/Rotron team and all the AMETEK colleagues contributing to the development of outstanding new products and technologies. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021 deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of six businesses. Those businesses are integrating nicely and we expect contributions from the acquisitions in the coming years as they further implement key elements of the AMETEK growth model. Our acquisition pipeline has remained strong, and our M&A teams remain busy in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. We have ample balance sheet capacity and strong cash flows to support our acquisition strategy, and expect to remain active over the coming quarters. Now let me touch on the supply chain issues. Overall, the global supply chain and logistics channels remained tight and unreliable. The supply chain and logistics environment in the first quarter was similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components. These issues are leading to higher inflation, but given our product differentiation, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread and outstanding margin expansion. Now to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we are bullish on the future, we remain cautious in the short-term given uncertainty related to the supply chain challenges, the war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in China. However, given the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage these ongoing headwinds. Additionally, our record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid and long cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth. For the full year, we continued to expect organic sales growth to be up mid to high single digits, while overall sales growth are expected to be up high single digits, down slightly versus our prior guidance given increased foreign currency headwinds. Given our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44, up 10% to 12% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.30 to $5.42 per diluted share. While confident in our increased outlook for the year, the COVID-19 lockdowns throughout China are expected to shift some sales from the second quarter into the second half. For the second quarter, overall sales are expected to be up low to mid single digits compared to the same period last year, and second quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.30 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% versus the prior year. To summarize, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion and a high quality of earnings, allowing us to increase our earnings guidance for the year. These outstanding results speak to the strength of the AMETEK growth model, along with the resilience of our world class workforce. Our differentiated technology solutions and market leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through these difficult economic cycles. While we expect these challenges will continue throughout 22, we remain well positioned for continued long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results to start the year highlighted by strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance, and a high quality of earnings. I'll provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $19.7 million, up $1 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expenses in the quarter. For 2022 general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels, and approximately 1.5% of sales. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20% and as we've stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated range. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $26 million. For the full year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million or approximately 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after tax acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share. For the quarter operating working capital was 17.1% of sales. Operating cash flow was $201 million and free cash flow was $175 million. Our first quarter working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and as a hedge against longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. While investment resulted in lower cash flows and free cash flow conversion in the first quarter, we continue to expect a strong 110% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $152 million. Total debt ended the first quarter at $2.54 billion unchanged from the end of 2021 and offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of about $340 million. The end of the first quarter gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.5 times and the net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.3. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities on March 31 to support our growth initiatives. As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions, as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital. In summary, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter, delivering strong earnings growth in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges. We're continuing to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. John, can we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson.
Matt Summerville: Thanks, good morning. Dave, could you maybe talk about where you were in Q1 from a price cost standpoint, what that spread looked like and how much realized price you expect for the full year? And then I have a follow up.
David Zapico: Sure, Matt. In the first quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. Pricing was about 5% and inflation was about 4%, so the spread was a little over 100 basis points. And for 2022, we expect price to be in the 4.5% to 5% range and the inflation to be in the 4% to 4.5% range, so about a 50% positive spread in our guide. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK product portfolio and our leadership positions and niches, the investments we're making in our products and technologies. And we've been staying ahead of inflation, as we said we would for probably the last year or so when we saw it coming down the line, so…
Matt Summerville: Got it. And then Dave, given your second quarter guidance and kind of the normal in a more normal year, typical cadence would dictate second quarter being at least a few cents above where you're at in Q1. Obviously you're not guiding that way this year, so I guess I'm trying to understand maybe how much contingency you're factoring in disruption, if you want to call it that, can you kind of parse that out a little bit? Thank you.
David Zapico: Yes, it's a good observation, Matt and it's fundamentally driven by the China lockdown scenario. You know, we have about 9% of our sales are out of China and we've been successful running a profitable growing operation there for many years. We have tremendous customer base, improving manufacturing processes, making the environment cleaner, improving research and development capabilities, and that's going to continue. But right now, several of our major facilities are in the Shanghai area and they're in a lockdown situation either and not operating or operating in a significantly reduced capacity and that's impacting a lot of our business. And our best assessment of what we know right now is, about a half of our China sales will be impacted in the quarter. So that's about 4% to 5% of our sales or $65 million or $70 million. So if you take that out of the guide, you'll see that the balance of AMETEK is going up in Q2. So it's really the fact that, of lower business activities in China, because of the lockdown situations and because of our proximity to Shanghai and some of our major operations. Now those sales are just going to be delayed. They're going to get delayed from the second quarter to the second half of the year and so we have to get through the lockdown in Q2.
Matt Summerville: Understood, thank you very much, David.
David Zapico: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: And our next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
David Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, I appreciate all the color. Could you take us through the key end markets and regional updates? We certainly just got the China update on the lockdowns. That's understood, but anything else especially European exposures? Thank you.
David Zapico: Sure Deane. I'll take you through the major markets first. Our process businesses were up 20% in the quarter, strong demand organic sales growth, contribution from the acquisitions of Magnetrol or and Alphasense. So organic sales for process were up mid teens in the quarter. Growth broad based, I mentioned in the prepared remarks the Ultra Precision Technologies business really saw excellent growth in the quarter. End market demand remained strong, all key and markets including semiconductor, research and medical are very strong. Additionally, we're seeing increased demand for our solutions serving sustainability initiatives with our instrumentation being used to reduce harmful emissions and process -- and improve process efficiency. So look at process our biggest segment for all of 2022, we continue to expect organic sales for our process businesses to be mid to high single digits. Next, our aerospace business. Our aerospace business was organically up low single digits in the quarter up in the mid 20s range for the first quarter in overall sales. In the quarter, we saw strength in commercial aerospace, being partially offset by delays in defense shipments caused by U.S. Government spending. So our commercial side of that business was up low double digits and our defense side of that business was down mid single digits. And for the full year we expect to be up mid single digits with commercial up high single digits and defense up low single digits for aerospace. Next, power and industrial. Overall sales were also up in the mid 20s, so good quarter at power and industrial. We had mid teens organic sales growth and the contributions from our acquisition of NSI-MI, so strong balanced sales growth across both power and industrial. And we expect organic sales for our power and industrial businesses to be up mid single digits with similar growth across both segments. And finally, our automation and engineering solutions, both overall and organic sales for automation and engineered solutions businesses were up mid teens on a percentage basis in the quarter with solid demand continuing across our end markets. For the full year, we continue to expect organic sales to be up for our automation engineered solutions business up mid to high single digits with similar growth across each business. So, strong performance across the entire business. I'll talk about the geography, you asked that question too. Strong broad based growth across all geographies, up mid teens in Europe, U.S. and Asia. China we were up 10% on an as reported basis, so good quarter there also. So when you look across the globe, there's really not a blemish in terms of growth, so we're feeling good about that also. With our orders, we think there's strong growth ahead.
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. And just last one, just to clarify, I understand the push out from the second quarter that may be China related. I might have missed this, but were there any revenues pushed out of the first quarter?
David Zapico: There really wasn't. The closure of China occurred late in the quarter, very late in the quarter and we had a heads up that that was happening. So we were able to really meet our demand requirements in the first quarter. But at the same time, overall for the company, there was -- there continued to be orders that did not ship in the first quarter and they were in that $50 million plus range. So if we were operating at 100% of supply chain, and everything else that was going on, we probably would have shipped another $50 million plus out in the first quarter.
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. Thank you.
David Zapico: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: And our next question is from Allison Poliniak-Cusic from Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys. Good morning.
David Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic: So just poking on sort of that end market and customer demand, is there any sort of change in behavior that's sort of causing you a little bit of pause with a specific business or vertical, that kind of leading to that things might be shifting a little bit or is it -- it's still quite strong across the board here?
David Zapico: It is quite strong across the board. I think over 90% of our business units had double digit sales and double digit orders and the ones that didn't were in the high single digits. So the orders are good, the sales are good. There's absolutely no slowdown that we see. You know, as I told you, couple of quarters ago, customers are giving us an early look into their demands, that's continuing, and but I really see no slowdown at all on that, at 22% orders and 18% orders growth and it is broad based and I think, on an order basis, organic orders EIG was 19 and EMG was 15, so both very strong.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. And then you talked about the pipeline for M&A being quite filled at this point, which is not atypical for you. Would you describe sort of kind of the things that you're seeing, what's kind of holding things back, is pricing still high at this point? Just any incremental color on the pipeline and what you're seeing out there today?
David Zapico: Sure. We remain active. We're looking at multiple deals. As always, we are focused on long-term returns. The one point that's -- it's a factor right now, if you look at private company multiples, and public company multiples. And with the stock market obviously, public company multiples have come in a bit, but the private company multiples are above public company multiples, and they're being stingy and reflecting what's happening in public markets. So there's a bit of a delay and some of the private businesses were looking at premium multiples. And I think that's causing some transactions to get pushed to the right. The difference between private and public multiples and the fact that the owners of the private businesses are holding on right now to -- for higher multiples from the public market.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Perfect, thank you. I'll pass it on.
David Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Howdy, thank you. I was actually going to follow on the last statement you just made was an interesting one. I just wanted to see if you would characterize acquisition pipeline funnel backlog and size. You guys had a record year last year, maybe some of that was because of 2020 was a little slower. But then was your statement then to imply that things have to kind of normalize between public and private before acquisition activity picks up or is it more situational? And that's a comment on the forecast, if you see the mean on that price line?
David Zapico: No, not a forecast, it is a comment, but it is a factor that is impacting valuations. But we have a very, very good pipeline, both smaller deals, public and private and I expect that you'll be hearing from us this year. And as you know, we're always focused on long-term returns, so we have to see value in what we're buying and we're very active right now.
Rob Wertheimer: Okay, perfect. And then I think your comments have been really clear that 90% and double digits is an amazing stat in some ways. There's a lot of consternation around Europe, whether there's going to be a slide into recession or just uncertainty on spending, et cetera, I assume from your comment you're not seeing any of that in your orders and backlog specific to Europe?
David Zapico: Yes, Europe was up 16% in the quarter, broad base strength. We had notable strength in our process businesses. Clearly there's some impact in the energy area and what the Ukraine crisis, the war in Ukraine, some of our products are used to help people get fuel efficiency, some of our products are used in applications that are actually helping those customers deal with higher energy costs. So right now, we're not seeing a slowdown. We read the press clippings like you have, but right now we're full go in Europe.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
Kevin Coleman: Okay.
Operator: And our next question is from Scott Graham from Loop Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning, Dave, Bill, Kevin, how are you?
David Zapico: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Graham: So I have two questions, one is on the price cost and I know that we came into this year with that fourth quarter, I think you had 100 basis point gap. In the first quarter you had the same. In the fourth quarter, I think you mentioned that you were expecting that gap to start to narrow, and it really didn't in the first quarter. So is it possible that you can get pricing enough to keep it at 100 for the rest of the year?
David Zapico: It is possible, Scott. I mean, that's -- our guidance is it, for it to narrow, but certainly we've been doing an excellent job. And I think our intention will be to try to maintain the same thread, but our guidance is for that to narrow a bit.
Scott Graham: Understood, thank you. Next question is on aerospace. And you know, commercial you said was up low double. And I was hoping maybe you could unbundle that OE versus MRO?
David Zapico: Yes, what drove the growth in our commercial, the low double digits was really the aftermarket and the business jet. Those markets both outperformed the OE.
Scott Graham: Okay. And from -- if I could just extend that last comment, what are you hearing from the big guys? Because they're -- obviously these guys are certainly mum on 2023? Are you hearing any changes in build rates for next year? Certainly costs a lot to take a flight these days, so I'm thinking that they're kind of padding things their -- their pockets a little bit? What is your sense there?
David Zapico: My sense is from our perspective, that market is going to continue to improve and it's one of our longer cycle exposures, and we're looking for a good continued growth in commercial in 2023.
Scott Graham: Got it? And if I could just sneak this last one in, I know that your vitality has been at about 25% for quite some time. Honestly, correct me if I'm wrong, it's the first time I've heard 26%. And I was just -- that's a really awesome number three years and what have you, and I hear you talk more and more about new products on these calls. Could that number continue to creep up this year?
David Zapico: Yes it can continue to creep up and we've got an incredible credible range of new products were being introduced. And they're also you think about, were the heat exchangers I've talked about from our Hughes-Treitler/Rotron business, I mean, we're saving 1 million tons of CO2. That's almost the entire carbon footprint of AMETEK over 10 years. It's an incredible design. It reduces weight. It's just a fantastic thing design and were already designed in and it's really bullish for the future. So we have the engineering capability to meet the needs of the customers in these changing times where sustainability is a more important factor. And I'm very excited about our product development. That's why we're investing heavily in that area and we have good things to come.
Scott Graham: Very good, Dave, thanks.
David Zapico: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.
David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. I know AMETEK is a sizable U.S. exporter. Given the U.S. dollar appreciation is that a drag on margins and can you remind us of your overall hedging strategy?
David Zapico: Sure, the first point is we are a sizable U.S. exporter and that's a correct statement, but our products are also very differentiated. So as evidenced by our price inflation spread so far, we're able to offset the higher U.S. dollar.
William Burke: And our cost structure.
David Zapico: The second point is our hedging strategy and actually, we don't have hedging strategy, because we're naturally hedged. So pretty much across the board, we spent a lot of time and this is about tenure all the time, it's a long period of time. We're naturally hedged in each of our locations that we operate. So our revenues and expenses naturally offset. And to give you an example, in this quarter where, you had a strong dollar, and there was some currency implications, it did impact our top line, but our bottom line across the whole enterprise, it was less than a penny impact on earnings. So we've got this natural hedging strategy and through the past tenure, you can go back and look at it, it works very well. We are a U.S. exporter, but we got the pricing leverage through our differentiated technology. So strong dollar is not usually an insurmountable win [ph] for us.
David Ridley-Lane: Understood. And quick follow up on Abaco. Are you seeing any sort of incremental demand out there from international defense budgets, which are going up? I know, this is probably more of a 2023, 2024 story, but has the sort of pipeline for your defense businesses change meaningfully? Thank you.
David Zapico: Yes, the pipeline is improving in international markets. We have businesses located in the UK besides Abaco that are also benefiting. So the fact that the international defense market is improving is a good thing for our aerospace and defense business.
Operator: And our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Michael on for Joe.
David Zapico: Hello, Michael.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, continuing with the defense theme, can you provide any color regarding the new U.S. defense budget now that it's been finalized?
David Zapico: Yes. Yes, the U.S. defense budget is good from our perspective in areas that we're investing. I mean, when you look at the whole thing, it was probably flattish to up a bit. So, but there's ample spending going on for us and we're really, it's a budget that we can work with. What hit us a bit in the first quarter and I talked about our defense businesses being down were the delays from the continuing resolution where no one has funding. So what we're seeing now is an uptick in order patterns and the second half of the year we expect that market to improve substantially.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.
David Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the webcast may be accessed in the Investor section of ametek.com. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you for joining ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 AMETEK, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today’s call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2020 or 2021 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of 2020 and the realignment charge taken in the first quarter of 2020. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave. 
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK concluded 2021 with an excellent fourth quarter. Stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operating performance resulted in robust profit and earnings growth. Demand remains strong and broad-based across our end markets, leading to superb order growth and a record backlog as we enter 2022. We are integrating six recent acquisitions into the AMETEK growth model and are well positioned to deploy capital on additional acquisitions, given our excellent cash flow generation and strong balance sheet. We asked a lot of our teams in 2021 and as the pandemic and supply chain tightness led to disruption and uncertainty. As always, our colleagues stepped up to these challenges and delivered tremendous results. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your hard work and tremendous contributions to our success. Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.50 billion, up 25% over the same period in 2020 and above our expectation. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added nine points and foreign currency was a one point headwind in the quarter. Overall, orders in the fourth quarter were $1.61 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an impressive 22% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.73 billion, which is up over 50% from the start of the year driven by strong, underlying orders across our businesses, plus the contributions from acquisitions. Fourth quarter operating income was a record $361 million, up 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 24%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 25.8%, up a very strong 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $437 million, up 21% over the prior year, and EBITDA margins were 29.1%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.37 per diluted share, up 27% over the fourth quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.28 to $1.30. Our record performance in the fourth quarter speaks to the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to drive strong growth throughout economic cycles. While the pandemic impacted results in 2020, we have quickly recovered and are now running well above pre-pandemic levels. For example, AMETEK's fourth quarter 2021 sales were 15% higher than our sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic, while core operating margins were up 300 basis points and earnings were up 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group, sales for EIG were a record $1.06 billion, up 29% compared to last year's fourth quarter, organic sales were up 17%, acquisitions added 13% and foreign currency was a one point headwind. Growth remains strong and broad-based across EIG with particularly strong growth in our Gatan and CAMECA businesses. EIG's fourth quarter operating income was a record $280 million up 18% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins were 26.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's core margins were excellent at 29.3% up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020. The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Fourth quarter sales for EMG were $447 million up 18% versus the prior year driven by broad-based organic sales growth. Our Automation businesses saw continued strong demand across a wide range of end markets. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $105 million, up 32% compared to the prior year. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 260 basis points to 23.6%. Now for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2021, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $5.5 billion up 22% from 2020. Organic sales increased 15%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency, a modest tailwind. Overall orders were up 40% versus the prior year with 26% organic orders growth leading to a record backlog and providing us solid visibility as we look ahead to 2022. Operating income for 2021 was $1.3 billion up 22%. And operating margins were 23.6% with core margins up 110 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $1.6 billion, up 20% from 2020. And full year 2021 earnings were $4.85 per diluted share, up 23% versus the prior year. In addition to the excellent financial results in 2021, we also positioned AMETEK for long-term success by continuing to invest in our businesses to support their organic growth initiatives. One important initiative is new product development, as we look to further expand our differentiated technology solutions in attractive growth markets. In 2021, we invested $300 million in research, development and engineering or approximately 5.5% of sales. This level of investment was up 22% over 2021. One way we measure the success of new product development efforts is through our vitality index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past three years. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index was a very strong 25%. These investments are driving outstanding innovation, including a growing number of important solutions in support of our customers' sustainability initiatives. We're supporting the development and expansion of renewable energy solutions, providing important technologies used to monitor, measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, assisting scientists and the understanding of the impacts of climate change and supporting the development and testing of electric vehicles, to name just a few of the important applications AMETEK plays a key role in supporting. We are expanding our research, development and engineering investments and expect to invest approximately $340 million or 5.5% of sales in RD&E in 2022. This is a 13% increase over 2021 RD&E spend. We are also deploying our capital and strategic acquisitions, adding to our portfolio of market-leading industrial technology businesses and driving excellent returns for our shareholders. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of six businesses. Our latest acquisition, Alphasense, was completed in the fourth quarter. Alphasense develops and manufactures gas and particulate sensors for use in environmental, health and safety and air quality applications. Their sensors are used in both fixed and portable systems to detect a variety of gases, including oxygen, volatile organic compounds and harmful toxic gases. Alphasense's sensor projects and technologies are highly complementary with our MOCON business and provide our sensor offering serving and broaden our sensor offering, serving critical health, safety and environmental applications. Alphasense is based in Essex, U.K. and has annual sales of approximately $30 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, and we expect to remain very busy in 2022. As our results reflect, our businesses are doing an excellent job managing the ongoing operational challenges caused by the pandemic. AMETEK's flexible, agile operating structure including our global supply chain capabilities, provide us the ability to quickly adjust and react to challenges. These supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing given our differentiated product offering. Overall, the operating environment remains similar to what we experienced during the third quarter with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components, along with logistics and labor availability issues. We remain focused in the short-term on managing our supply chain and ensuring we can safely operate our factories, while also continuing to drive long-term operational excellence initiatives across our businesses. Moving to our outlook for 2022. We remain cautious in the short-term, given ongoing COVID-19 and supply chain challenges. However, we are confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid- to high-single digits versus 2021. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.42, up 9% to 12% compared to 2021. For the first quarter, overall sales are expected to be up approximately 20% compared to the same period last year, and first quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.28 per diluted share up 16% to 20% versus the prior year. In summary, I would like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts this past year. AMETEK's fourth quarter and full year results were excellent and reflective of the resilience and strength of our workforce and the AMETEK growth model. Our strong orders and record backlog position us nicely for 2022, and we look forward to the New Year and continuing to build on the momentum gained in 2021. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2021 with outstanding operating performance leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2022. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $23.7 million, up $6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $19 million, also driven largely by higher compensation costs. For 2022, general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% down from 20.1% in the fourth quarter 2020. This lower tax rate was due to return to provision adjustments. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was excellent at 15.2% of sales; this reflects the strong work from our teams in managing working capital. We have also strategically added inventory in certain areas to help address the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. Capital expenditures were $43 million in the fourth quarter and $111 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2022 are expected to be approximately $125 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million and for the full year was $292 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. Operating cash flow was $282 million in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion for the full year. Free cash flow was $238 million in the quarter and $1.05 billion or 106% of net income for the full year. Total debt at the year-end was $2.54 billion, up only $131 million from the end of 2020 despite having deployed approximately $2 billion on acquisitions in 2021. Despite the record level of capital deployment, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 1.8 times at the end of 2020 to 1.5 times at the end of 2021, a testament to the strength of our operating model. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $347 million. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2022 remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and our world-class workforce. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew, could we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Bill Burke: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: It's a great order backlog numbers. I would just like to get maybe a little bit more color in terms of how this backlog might be looking differently than historical, I think we've talked about duration extending a little bit. Is that still happening? Are you seeing any orders sort of getting pushed to the right because of your customers, maybe their labor issues? Just any color on how that's sort of evolving over the past year for you?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I mean the orders have been very strong and I think it reflects organic growth initiatives and also the recovery of the economy. And we're doing very well, and if you look at our portfolio the one aspect that hasn't fully recovered is really our aerospace and defense business and our oil and gas businesses. But the rest of the portfolio, their mid-cycle businesses are doing incredibly well and I call out our automation business, which is doing extremely well, and I'd also call out our process business, which has really got momentum. But it's across the board and on top of that, it was – for the quarter, the way the quarter played out, it was each month of the quarter got better. And on orders, December was the highest month we had in the whole year. So we ended on strength and we have a very healthy backlog. And the one thing I mentioned a few calls ago is I think our customers, because of some supply chain challenges across all the market, are giving us a look into what their demand patterns are. So we're seeing orders earlier, but that doesn't take away from the strength that we're feeling in the business.
Allison Poliniak: Great. No, that's helpful. And then a nice investment or dollars being allocated towards investment this year and then you talked to some high-level thoughts there. Any specific verticals that maybe you're more focused on than others? I know you highlighted a few product capabilities. Just any color there?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think the – we're making broad-based growth investments, and we're getting tremendous return from our engineering investment and it's across the board. You understand the way we manage our portfolio, but the sustainability opportunities for us are growing, and we're investing them. This year, we'll put about $110 million of incremental growth investments in our business. So that's on top of last year's incremental investments and those are in RD&E in sales and marketing. But fundamentally, we see opportunities and we're going to invest in additional $110 million, and we're going to keep the momentum going.
Allison Poliniak: Great. Thanks so much. I will pass along.
Dave Zapico: Thanks, Allison.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Bill Burke: Good morning.
Deane Dray: Hey, it's very impressive giving the understanding of how tough the supply chain issues are inflation, labor shortages and everything and you're still able to deliver these numbers because a lot of your peers are struggling here. And maybe – look, I know its lots and lots of hard work. Your business mix tends to have a bit more what I'll call medium technology that has microprocessors, chips and we're seeing companies that are saying, "Look, that's the biggest chokepoint for them", but we're not hearing that from you. But just what is it about either your mix or your dual supply? You've done something very well here given what your exposures might have been. So maybe kind of help us there.
Dave Zapico: Yes. I'll try to give you some more color there. I mean, everything that you said is true and we're experiencing the same challenges as everyone is with supply chain, logistics, labor availability. And the Omicron variant certainly added a lot fourth quarter and Q1. But our overall response to these challenges has been outstanding. And I think the first point is our distributed business model, where we have committed P&L managers running their business units with their own supply chain teams, which allows them to react quickly to changing conditions. And at the same time we have these business teams; we have a corporate centralized supply chain team that acts with all the combined leverage in the forte of AMETEK. And these teams work seamlessly together, and this overall approach has been extremely effective for us. As I mentioned in the last quarter and this quarter, it's directly what you said semiconductor chip availability, we have a lot of shortages, but that's the biggest area. And that's the one that's the most challenging and we're going after that a few ways. I mean, we're using our leverage of AMETEK. We have relationships built-up over a long period of time with the supply base. Our engineering capability is second to none, and we use it to qualify second sources, find alternatives, do redesigns and we've also taken a team of people across the company. Some of them are based on our Bangalore engineering office. Some of them are based in Germany. Some of them are based in the U.S., and that team is available to quickly help our business units for shortages and find alternatives, and that's working quite well. So we don't really improve – anticipate improvements and availability of semiconductor chips until the second half of 2022 at the earliest, and it's certainly a challenge. But I think we've had an effective response to it for the reasons that I just mentioned.
Deane Dray: That's great. I really appreciate that additional color. And maybe if you could just take us through your key end markets for updates there and regions, if you could?
Dave Zapico: Sure. I'll start with the Process business. The Process overall sales were up 20% – low 20% in the quarter driven by strong organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisitions of Magnetrol and Alphasense. Organic sales were up high teens for process. Our Materials Analysis businesses showed the strongest growth, they were driven by as I said in my prepared remarks, like Gatan and CAMECA. The businesses have leading positions providing high-end instrumentation into life sciences and semiconductor markets. And looking ahead for Process, we expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be up mid- to high-single digits for the full year. Now I'll switch to Aerospace. Overall sales for Aerospace & Defense businesses were up over 40% in the fourth quarter, driven by the acquisition of Abaco and mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Our commercial businesses led to growth in the quarter driven by strong aftermarket and business jet growth, while our defense businesses were down slightly in the quarter due to some shipment delays, it still had another strong year. Shifting to 2020, while we remain cautious about the patient the commercial aerospace recovery we're still well positioned to benefit from the recovery, given our attractive positions in a diverse set of commercial and business jet platforms. So for 2022, we expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our Aerospace & Defense businesses with both defense and commercial expected to be up mid-single digits. And I go to our Power & Industrial market segment next. Overall sales for Power & Industrial were up over 25% in the fourth quarter and a very good fourth quarter, driven by mid-teens organic sales growth and the contributions from the acquisition of NSI-MI. And for all of 2022, we expect Power & Industrial to be up mid-single digits with similar growth across our Power and Industrial segments. And finally our Automation & Engineered Solutions. both overall and organic growth for Automation & Engineered Solutions were up low 20% in the quarter. Automation businesses delivered outstanding growth in the quarter and full year with continued solid demand across our end markets. And in 2022, we expect organic sales for Automation and Engineered Solutions to be up mid- to high-single digits with similar growth across our Automation & Engineered Solutions. So if you look at the big picture, our Process and Automation & Engineered Solutions, market segments are going to be up mid- to high-single digits and Aerospace and Power and Industrial will be up mid-single digits.
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.
Andrew Shlosh: Hi, guys. It's Andrew Shlosh on for Jeff. How are you?
Dave Zapico: Hi, Andrew.
Andrew Shlosh: Good. Good. Thanks for taking the question. Firstly on price cost, do you kind of have a view on the cadence if at all, any improvement of price cost throughout the year? I mean what's your view there?
Dave Zapico: Throughout 2021 or 2022?
Andrew Shlosh: 2022, another – yes.
Dave Zapico: Yes. For some context, we had – for 2021, we had about 3.5% of price and inflation, total inflation in our business was in the mid-2s. And for next year, we're expecting inflation to tick up a bit. So instead of the 3.5%, maybe 3.5% to 4% – excuse me, we're expecting our pricing to pick up a bit to 3.5% to 4%, and inflation 3% to 3.5%. So we'll see – we budgeted a 50 basis point spread for a positive price inflation spread. And we see it a bit higher in Q1, and we're expecting it to level off after that. But end of the day, it's about – price is about 3.5% to 4% for 2022. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK's product portfolio. That's the way we're able to get price in excess of inflation in our business. We have leadership positions in our niche markets around the globe. So does that answer your question?
Andrew Shlosh: Absolutely. No, that's great color. The only other one I had just on margins for 2022, I mean, I think it's fair to assume some pretty modest expansion, I mean, given just what you just said on price cost. But would you say it's accurate? I know you don't want to get to the business that's guiding margins for the full year?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I'd say that – I think we're going to have another good margin year. Our, I think core operating margins will be up in that 30 to 40 basis point range. And I think core and reported incrementals will be in that 30% range. I mean in the – and in Q4, we had really healthy margins. Our core incrementals, our reported incrementals are 21%, but when you back out the acquisitions, we had healthy core incrementals of 32%. And I think that's going to continue into 2022. So I'm pretty bullish about the things that we're doing on cost management and improvement in the cost structure.
Andrew Shlosh: Great. Thanks for the color. I will pass it on.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Loop Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning Dave, Bill, Kevin, how are you?
Dave Zapico: Good morning.
Scott Graham: Hey, Dave, would you mind giving us a split of organic orders by segment for the quarter?
Dave Zapico: Sure. I can do that. If you look at Q4, our organic orders for the total company were up 22%, and EIG orders were up 21% and EMG orders were up 23%. So really strong growth across both growth groups of the company and the book-to-bill was 1.07.
Scott Graham: Right. And that's actually a perfect dovetail into my next question. Over the years, through acquisitions and just streamlining and investments, the EMG segment has really caught up a lot to the EIG in terms of our organic growth profile. So I'm wondering how does that work in what you're looking at in acquisitions. Is it more equal – and it's not going to be equally split because I know EIG is a lot larger segment than EMG. But I mean are you spending a lot of time in both segments on deals?
Dave Zapico: Absolutely, absolutely, Scott. I mean we'd love to put more M&A to our EMG segment, specifically in our automation businesses. We're just knocking it out of the park there, and we made some good acquisitions in the past years and couple that with some really good organic growth and an excellent engineering capability. In fact, we did a really small acquisition in 2021 to add some robotic capability to that business. But that's an area we also like our thermal management system business, commercial and defense business, but they're – we have a good leadership position, and we have some – we're looking hard there. So EMG is going to – EMG is getting looked at very hardly in terms of M&A, and their past performance has been fantastic.
Scott Graham: That's great. Thank you. Just if I could squeeze this one last one in. It's an easy one. The research markets, as you know, hard to always study the trends in those markets from outside the four walls of AMETEK. How is research going for you? Are you being aided by sort of the reopenings? Are you – how are your investments working? That's a pretty important market for you. How is it – how's it going there?
Dave Zapico: Now research is about 10% of our sales in the process group and you're right, it's an important market for us. And what we saw mainly in the beginning of 2021 is the industrial research market was very good, but the universities took time to pick up because of the impacts of the pandemic. And what you're seeing right now is, I highlighted in my talk, the Gatan business, and that's more life sciences research and they're doing extremely well. And other parts of that business or the research market are picking up nicely. So it's not going to be as big of a growth driver because of the nature of the funding, but we're clearly transitioning from a more difficult funding environment during – and at the start of the pandemic to a better funding environment at this stage of the pandemic where I'd say all aspects of the research market are getting back to business.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Good morning, everybody.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: So you managed through a really, really choppy 4Q better than many and admirably. And I guess the question is going to be on the short-term, how does it feel now versus then? I don't know what you can say on underlying indicators of Omicron, whether that's crested or not and whether you feel you've conquered some of the difficulties out there, whether it gets better or worse? And then I'll just put the other one in there now. Just on long-term runway, it seems like there's a ton of momentum in automation and semiconductors. Maybe that's evident in your backlog a little bit. I don't know how far out your visibility goes on projects and bidding and quoting and just what your feel for those end markets is throughout the year? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Great questions, Rob, I mean, the first one is the Omicron variant. I believe we have a lot of statistics when you look at outside the world, and we also have our own internal statistics for AMETEK. And it looks like the peak infections are cresting. So I think the last two weeks, we were down a bit, and we had the highest level of infections prior to that. So it's clearly the same things that are happening outside of AMETEK are happening inside of AMETEK, but we're doing a pretty good job of managing through it. But it does cause absenteeism and it does cause labor availability and it's a challenge every day when something changes to manage through that. So that's clearly – that's part of the issue we're dealing with Q1. And our guide range is a little bit broader because of that. But our people are doing a fantastic job. When you talk about the long-term and runway and automation and semiconductors, we're seeing that. And if you think – I talked a little about the automation market and how we've done past acquisitions to acquire pieces of the automation, motion control, subassemblies that we've now put together, and we're very capable of quickly develop custom designs for our customers. We're kind of unique in that capability and we're winning a lot there. And I think that's going to continue. And when you look at the semiconductor market, really solid growth in Q4, but it's continuing. And we're competing in two parts of that market. We work in the research market. And I mentioned our CAMECA business did very well. That business is benefiting from the research side of semiconductors. And then you got some new technology that are going into the ramp in chip production. And some of the new technology uses something called EUV optics, and our Zygo business is an expert in that and there's only a couple of people in the world that are an expert in that. So, we're benefiting from the transition to EUV optics in the semiconductor industry, and that trend is just getting started. So, I'm not saying there's going to be some ups and downs as we go forward, but we're really well positioned in both automation and semiconductors as we look forward.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks for the teaching there. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.
Andrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Hello Andrew.
Andrew Buscaglia: Can you talk a little bit more broadly regionally? And specifically, I'm looking for maybe some context around China, just given – it seems like there's some increased risk there, maybe not direct risk but indirect impact from a number of things, supply chain risk and, yes, component shortages, et cetera.
Dave Zapico: Yes. Sure. I'll talk to that. The first point is I'll give a whole geographical look at our business first in Q4. It was a strong, broad-based growth across all geographies. In the U.S., we were up mid-teens and notable strength in our Automation businesses. In Europe, we were up mid-30s. So, we bounced back nicely there, and we had notable strength in both our Automation and Process businesses. And in Asia, we were up 4% and notable strength in Process and Automation there also. So broad-based firing on all cylinders. Your point is a good one. The reaction that COVID is handled differently in parts of the world. So, you can have, semiconductor plants are being shut down or blocking access to certain countries at times, and we've been managing through that at the start of the pandemic. But in particular, you asked about China, and we were up 2% in China, very solid because we had a really strong comparison, and we had a really strong year. So notable strength in Zygo, notable strength in process and China is strong for us, it has been strong all year and then put in a strong quarter. So as the outlook, we see for our types of businesses in our niche markets where we're competing solid pipeline of growth in China continuing.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. Yes, that's helpful. And maybe one last one with commercial aerospace, that was strong, and I see that really strong growth exiting the year. I might have asked this question every other quarter for like the past two years. But what is kind of your sense with this demand building for like a reopening in the back half of the year? Is it kind of more of the same?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think we're seeing some strength in our commercial businesses for sure. They were up low double digits in the quarter driven by aftermarket and business yet. But we're being cautious for the year because of the pandemic's impact on travel and different impacts in different parts of the world. And we think we're still going to have a good year. We're going to be up mid-single digits. And we're ready for that market to inflect upwards. It might happen in the second half of this year but it might be 2023 also. We're not sure.
Andrew Buscaglia: Is that aftermarket typically a leading indicator for that – for you guys when that starts to pick up?
Dave Zapico: I think you see two things. I mean the aftermarket is a leading indicator, and the industry went through a hard shutdown and now it's recovering, and we're seeing good aftermarket. And business jets are a function of people deciding to travel differently.
Andrew Buscaglia: Yes.
Dave Zapico: And good position in both of those and seeing strong demand. 
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey good morning, everybody. This is Brian on for Nigel.
Dave Zapico: Hey Brian.
Unidentified Analyst: So maybe just the growth investment, the $110 million. Any more color on where that's going, like within R&D and engineering, just any specific kind of initiatives or new products?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I'll start with the money first. We're putting about $40 million into increased R&D, and we're putting about $70 million into increased sales and marketing. And on the R&D side, it's across a wide range of platforms. We're not dependent on any one platform, and our business leaders put forth where they want to spend our incremental growth investments. So, it's spread out amongst good opportunities across our business. And in terms of the sales and marketing, we're doing a lot of work on e-commerce on digitization, and those are investments that will pay off very quickly, and they're already providing return for us because we sell to our customers different now through the pandemic, and we're expanding on our capability in that area.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for that. And then when I think about the bridge into 2022, outside of kind of the price cost dynamics and this growth investment, is there anything else to be thinking about at the margin? And then also just kind of on a similar note, do you expect kind of normal seasonality to hold because some of your peers are kind of talking about a tale of two halves as far as depressed margins in the first half, but it just feels like you're navigating the supply chain better. So, you might not see that same dynamic. Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think with our budget and increases sequentially each quarter, which is typical of an AMETEK budget, but we're seeing strong growth in Q1. So, your point is taken. When I look at our budget, just based on simple economics, we've guided to be up about 10%, and that's about $500 million. And if you apply a 30% to 35% contribution margin on that increase. You'll get a number that's in the range of the guidance that we gave you. Now in that number, there is a lot of new investments, there's cost savings, there's acquisitions that we did last year, there are some headwinds with below-the-line type things, taxes, shares, a little bit higher interest cost. But when you bake the cake and you put it all together, it's a pretty simple picture. Sales are up 10%. That's about $500 million, and we're going to get a 30% to 35% contribution margin on. So, it's pretty clear from that perspective.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey, good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano : Yes. Apologies if I ask questions that have already been asked or answered. It's been a bit of a busy one this morning. But on the order side, I mean, obviously, really strong and it has been so, like what's your view on book-to-bill as the year progresses? And I know you are less susceptible to this than others. But like how the early ordering – kind of like what are you seeing? Is there any kind of like inventory at customers or like ordering so far in advance that it could set up like a vacuum at some point? Like how are you kind of thinking about your customer order patterns here?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I mean we have customized products.
Joe Giordano : Yes.
Dave Zapico: So, I don't think that people are investing in – we're not going to run into a distributor problem or things like that. But at the same time, we've talked about our customers being aware of the supply chain issues and giving us increased visibility and placing orders on us to go out to the future. So, we're seeing that in our backlog. And at some point, that may roll over. But right now, it looks very strong. We mentioned in the prior remarks before you got on our organic orders were up 26%, and it was both strong in EIG and EMG. EIG orders organically were up, similar spread across the businesses. So, we are – I think the month of January was strong, and it supports our guide. But the order rates have not changed into January. Anything else?
Joe Giordano : Okay interesting. Maybe, and again, you might have answered this, but did you give the core incremental ex like M&A dilution for EIG in 4Q?
Dave Zapico: Yes. We did talk about the – it was 32% core for the whole company, and it was reported 2021. So, we really had a good performance core. And you had...
Bill Burke: It was up 50 basis points margins ex acquisitions in EIG.
Dave Zapico: Yes, yes. It was up 50 basis points ex acquisitions…
Joe Giordano : Is that…
Dave Zapico: [Indiscernible] business was up two sixty or two thirty, so it was good. So, the margins across the board were good for the company. And you look at EIG, you look at EMG, there are some acquisitions that depress EIGs but the incrementals were 32% for the whole company. The EIG core incrementals were 33% and the EMG core incrementals were 38%. So, the reported incrementals for EIG were a little bit lower because of the acquisitions, but really strong core incremental margins across the company.
Joe Giordano : Very good. Thanks guys.
Dave Zapico: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird.
Rob Mason: Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Mason: Just maybe to stick on the topic around acquisitions. I'm just curious what the acquisition – I could probably do this math at some point. But just what did the acquisitions contribute to earnings in 2021? And what's the component in the bridge in 2022 in terms of EPS?
Dave Zapico: I believe it was 16% in the bridge for EPS for 2022. And I believe it was about the same for 2021. But that $0.16 is included in the economics of the budgets that I talked about just a few minutes ago.
Rob Mason: Sure, sure. And Dave, I mean, you noted it was a very busy year for you…
Dave Zapico: Rob, Kevin just told me, I said $0.16. It's actually $0.18. So, its $0.18 in 2022 and it happened to be $0.18 in 2021. So it's $0.18 for both of them.
Rob Mason: Okay, understand. You had, as you mentioned, a very busy year on the acquisition front. And I'm just curious, integration-wise with all the challenges around supply chain. Has that helped or hurt you in terms of your ability to integrate that? Has it forced you to move a little bit faster on the supply chain front?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think it's forced us to move faster and getting the AMETEK culture installed and getting the AMETEK processes installed. So, the differences are obvious, and we're working with the teams, and the integration of AMETEK is going very well. And it's early in the ownership, and we usually take it slower, but the environment made us go faster and they're integrating nicely into the company. And the benefits of our distributed operating models, we can take on a bunch of deals like that and be able to integrate them all. And they are fantastic businesses. I mean they each fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. They are leaders in niche markets. Each have strong differentiated technology positions and they are expanding our presence in attractive markets. So, the acquisitions are going very well. And myself, and Bill and the group presidents have been spending a lot of time on them.
Rob Mason: Yes, yes. And just one last one, just to follow on there. Abaco was your largest one, largest one ever, I think. And I noticed a nine-digit order recently. Within a business like that, what does an order like that or win, I should say, what would that shift – over what time frame would something like that shift?
Dave Zapico: It can be years. It really could be years. And specifically with Abaco, I mean, that team there is really talented, and were into the high 90% of the integration, and it's a high-quality management team. In terms of the org structure, we've combined it with our AMETEK Aerospace PDS business unit. So, when we looked at this business, we think there's a lot of synergies. So, we formed one division, and we now have a seasoned AMETEK P&L leader running the division along with the seasoned AMETEK CFO and along with a seasoned AMETEK HR person. So, we've installed some people there to help them – Abaco understand the AMETEK Ultera – at the same time, we're learning a lot from Abaco also because they have a lot of talent. So, I think this combination over the long run is going to be good for both businesses, and it's going to drive sales and cost synergy for both the AMETEK PDS business and Abaco.
Rob Mason: Excellent. Excellent, I’ll pass it back. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Kevin Coleman, for any closing remarks.

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin (ph), and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another outstanding quarter, with better-than-expected sales growth, strong operating performance, and earnings above our expectations. We established records for sales, EBITDA, operating income, and earnings per share in the quarter. Demand remains strong across our diverse set of end markets, leading to robust order growth and a record backlog. While the global supply chain and logistics networks remains challenging, our businesses are doing a tremendous job navigating these issues and delivering results which exceeded our expectations. Given our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. This strong overall performance reflects the exceptional work of all AMETEK colleagues, as well as the strength, flexibility, and sustainability of the Grand AMETEK growth model. AMETEK 's proven business model was central to our focus on creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. We're very proud of the important steps we are taking to further sustainability across AMETEK. And last week, we published our latest corporate sustainability report to highlight our efforts in this area. This report provides information on our sustainability initiatives, the strong progress we have made, and the commitments we are making to create a better future. I welcome you all to read our latest corporate sustainability report, which is located on our website.
Dave Zapico: Now, let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were a record $1.44 billion, up 28% of the same period in 2020 and above our expectations. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added 11 points, and foreign currency was a modest benefit in the quarter. Overall, orders in the third quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 37% over the prior-year period. While organic orders were up an impressive 31% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.62 billion, which is up over $800 million from the start of the year. Third quarter operating income was a record $338 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter of 2020, and operating margins were 23.4%.  Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 24.7%, up 70 basis points versus the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA in the third quarter was a record $415 million, up 25% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 28.8%. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.26 per diluted share, up 25% over the third quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of a $1.16 to $1.18. We continue to generate strong levels of cash flow with third quarter operating cash flow of $307 million and free cash flow conversion of 109% of Net Income. Overall, tremendous results in a challenging operating environment.  Next, let me provide some additional details of the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for EIG were a record $982 million, up 31% over last year's third quarter. Organic sales were up 15%, acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency was a modest [indiscernible] While growth remains broad-based, growth was particularly strong across our ultra-precision technologies and our Power and Industrial businesses. EIG third quarter operating income was a record $245 million up 20% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins were 25%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG 's core margins were excellent at 27.2% in line with prior year margins.  The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Third quarter sales increased 21% versus the prior year to $459 million. Organic sales were up 20% and currency added 1 point to growth. Growth remains strong across all of the EMG with our automation businesses, again, delivering notably strong growth in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was a record $115 million, up a robust 36% compared to the prior-year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 270 basis points to a record 25%. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. AMETEK has had an excellent year with a record level of capital deployment, lean to the acquisition of 5 highly strategic businesses.  AMETEK has deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far this year, reflecting the strength of AMETEK 's acquisition strategy and our ability to identify and acquire highly strategic companies. Our proven operating capabilities allow us to drive meaningful improvements across our acquired companies, resulting in outstanding returns on capital. Generating strong returns on capital deployed is critical to long-term sustainable growth, an important element of AMETEK 's strategy. AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to support our capital deployment strategy. Our acquisition pipeline remains very active.  Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, identifying attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain busy over the coming quarters. We also remain focused on investing back into our businesses to support the organic growth initiatives, including in support of their new product development efforts. In the third quarter, we invested over $75 million in RD&E, and for all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. Through these investments, our businesses develop unique and highly differentiated solutions to help solve our customers most complex challenges. One such example is a new product introduction from AMETEK Gatan.  Gatan is a leading provider of direct detection technology for electron microscopy supporting high-end research and materials on life sciences applications. Gatan recently introduced the Stela hybrid pixel camera. The only fully integrated hybrid pixel electron detector with the Gatan microscopy suite. This new product reinforces Gatan 's leadership position, providing the highest quality TEM diffraction camera, allowing the user to perform 4D stem analysis for the [Indiscernible] and high dynamic range.  Gatans 's new camera builds on a long history of disruptive and award-winning technology. In August, the Stela camera was awarded the 2021 Microscopy Today Innovation Award and called one of the 10 game - changing products and methods. I would like to congratulate the team at Gatan for the recent launch of the Stela camera, and broader support of important research applications. Now, let me touch on the supply chain issues. The global supply chain remains challenging.  We see extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components, with logistics issues and labor availability adding to the complexity. While these difficulties exist, we exceeded our sales estimates for the quarter, and are navigating the challenging environment well, given our agile operating approach. This supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, given our differentiation we we're able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread. While we expect these challenges will continue into 2022, we remain well-positioned to navigate the issues given the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model.  Moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Given our strong performance in the third quarter, and the continuous strong order to momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guides. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up in the low 20% range versus our previous guide of two up approximately 20%. Organic sales are now expected to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis over 2020 as compared to our previous [indiscernible] of approximately 10%. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.76 to $4.78, an increase of approximately 21% over 2020 as comparable basis and above our prior guide of $4.62 to $4.68 per diluted share.  For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the low 20% range versus last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be between $1.28 to $1.30, up 19% to 20% over last year's fourth quarter. In summary, AMETEK 's third quarter results were excellent. Our teams continued to execute and our businesses are performing well. Our performance through a challenging environment shows the resilience and strength of the AMETEK growth model. The asset led nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets, and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success.  The proven nature of the AMETEK growth model continues to drive long-term success for all of the AMETEK stakeholders. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill.
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter, with continued strong sales growth, and orders growth, and outstanding operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter, general and administrative expenses were $22.1 million, up $4.8 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% for the quarter unchanged from the prior year.  For 2021, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up approximately $18 million driven by higher compensation costs or approximately 1.5% of sales, also unchanged from the prior year. Third quarter, other income and expense was better by approximately $4 million versus last year's third quarter, driven by a $6 million or approximately $0.02 per share gain on the sale of a small product line in the quarter. The gain -- this gain on the sale was more than offset by a higher effective tax rate in the quarter of 19.5%, up from 17.5% in the same quarter last year. For 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19.5% and 20%.  Actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was 14.9% of sales down 210 basis points from the 17% reported in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in managing working capital. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter was $75 million.  For all of 2021, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $295 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $138 million or $0.60 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. In the third quarter, operating cash flow was $307 million and free cash flow was $281 million, with free cash flow conversion 109% of Net Income. Total debt at quarter-end was $2.65 billion, up less than $250 million from the end of 2020, despite having deployed approximately $1.85 billion on acquisitions thus far in 2021.  Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $359 million. In the quarter end, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.6 times and our net debt to rate -- EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.25 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, our businesses drove outstanding results in the third quarter and throughout the first 9 months of 2021. Our Balance Sheet and tremendous cash flow generation have positioned the Company for significant growth in the coming quarters and years. Kevin (ph).
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill (ph). Angie (ph), we're now ready to open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. A couple of questions. First, Dave, can you talk about where you were with realized pricing in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, what the spread looked like? You mentioned that it seemed pretty favorable. And then what your thoughts are in terms of how much price you might need to take in '22?
Dave Zapico: Sure Matt (ph). In the third quarter, our pricing continued to more than offset inflation. As I said in the prepared remarks, pricing was about 3.5% of sales and inflation was about 2.5% of sales. So we got a spread of about 100 basis points. And we expect in Q4 that'll be similar to Q3 with slightly higher pricing and inflation. And the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK 's product portfolio and our leadership position in niche markets around the world. In terms of next year, we haven't done the detailed planning, but a key for me is that we're going to stay out ahead of inflation, and I expect that to be true next year. So we'll stay ahead of inflation with price. Did I answer your question, Matt (ph)?
Matt Summerville: Yes. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, if I just look over the last two years, EMG margins have really migrated into a completely different zip code versus where they were at. I know divesting Reading is a component to that. You did some structural cost outs during when -- due to COVID outbreak. Is there still leverage to drive margins higher in that business? Help me think about how we should think about that going forward.
Dave Zapico: EMG has done a fantastic job in margin development and you mentioned some of the key drivers. We've divested Reading. But fundamentally, we have an automation business that's firing on all cylinders, it's very profitable. We have a thermal management system as part of our defense industry -- defense businesses. It's doing well and has high margin. And we have some part of our [Indiscernible] business that's accelerating. So it is in a new zip-code, but I expect it to stay there and there's still room for margin expansion.
Matt Summerville: Great. Thank you, Dave (ph).
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Matt (ph).
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley, please proceed with your question.
Josh Pokrzywinski: This is actually [Indiscernible] on for Josh. So looking at backlog, where it stands today, how much of that would you call it excess backlog, kind of, based on supply chain issues? And how much should we expect that to contribute to 2022 growth here?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. We have a record backlog of $2.62 billion and -- I wouldn't categorize as excess. I mentioned in an earlier call that customer behavior is to give you more visibility into future months and quarters because there's so many issues in the supply chain. So you have more visibility, but I would not consider as excess, and I would not view us as not keeping up with demand. So really you have a situation where there's strong underlying demand, its resulting in a higher backlog, it's giving us further insight into 2022, and we feel really good about it.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. So what are the biggest inflation and supply-chain issues that we should watch for AMETEK as conditions potentially do start to improve? Is it on the material side, freight, or labor? Just kind of what should we keep our eyes on?
Dave Zapico: That's a good question. During the quarter, we continue to experience challenges with our supply chain, logistics, inflation, labor availability, and it was one of the more dynamic environments I can recall. And these conditions were a bit worse in Q3 than Q2, and we expect those conditions to persist in the fourth quarter. And I would characterize our overall effort in response to these challenges as outstanding. We're clearly showing the agility necessary to navigate these supply chain disruptions. A key, for my view, is the distributed nature of our business model where we have committed P&L managers running their businesses with their own supply chain teams, which allow them to react quickly to changing conditions.  And at the same time, these dedicated business unit teams are working seamlessly with our overall corporate supply chain team that acts with a combined leverage and the authority of all of AMETEK. And this overall approach has been effective for us. I mean, you asked where we had some -- the biggest issues we had. As I mentioned last quarter, it's in semiconductor chip availability. It's an area that's particularly challenging because we use a lot of electronics in our businesses, obviously. And we're using our purchasing leverage to relationships that we build up over decades. Our engineering capability in terms of qualifying second sources in terms of changing designs to solve problems. And we don't expect -- anticipate improvements in the availability of semiconductors until sometime in late 2022.  It's a tough environment and -- but we're reacting well to it, and I was very pleased with our teams. And I point to one thing is distributed business model, where we have very experienced P&L leaders making sure that they're going to satisfy their customers and not letting the supply chain get in the way.
Josh Pokrzywinski: That's helpful. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Allison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Hello, Allison (ph), and good morning.
Allison Poliniak: I just want to keep in line with the supply chain because obviously you guys are a bit unique in that you've certainly been managing this quite well. Is there a sense, I mean, organic looks very strong, your organic orders are very strong. Is there any tempering of maybe what growth could have been because of some of these supply chain issues or they're really not impactful to you guys in terms of what that expected growth could be or the volume that you were anticipating this quarter?
Dave Zapico: That's a good question, Allison (ph), because what we do is we set our plan based on material availability. And we executed that plan extremely well. In fact, we beat our expectations, but we did, at the end of the quarter, I look at it as if the stars aligned, what could we have shipped without some of the material availability issues? And it was about an additional $50 million that shifted out of Q3 to Q4.  And I feel like we're going to have the same kind of shift out of Q4 into Q1. So we're able to meet demand, we're able to juggle the schedule. Once we lock into the schedule, we're very good at executing it. But there was about $50 million that slipped out. Now, we're not a big labor business. We have a -- labor is not a big cost driver for us. So labor availability is tough, but we're able to get the products manufactured with the labor available. So your answer is $50 million in an ideal world.
Allison Poliniak: That's helpful, thank you. And then just on the acquisition environment, you obviously deployed a significant amount at the beginning of the year. It sounds like the pipeline as always is pretty active. Any color on, kind of, what you're a little bit more focused on, or what we could see, maybe near-term over the next few months, if the stars align there?
Dave Zapico: Yes. We are very focused on some deals right now, and I don't know if they're going to happen next month or three months from now, but we're very active over the next few months. I mean, the thing you have to be careful of right now is there's a lot of businesses that are out there and you have to sort through them and find the quality, find the gems within those pipelines. And we're good at that. And I just feel the pipeline remains strong. We're very active on exploring opportunities. As Bill mentioned, we have a meaningful level of financing capacity and strong cash flows.  And we also have -- so I think 2022 is going to be a good year for us and we're going to have a tailwind from some of the deals we got done this year. So we're feeling pretty optimistic about what we've got done this year, the quality of businesses that we acquired, and we're feeling good about our pipeline for 2022.
Allison Poliniak: Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Allison.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deanne Drey with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Deanne Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning. Deanne (ph).
Deanne Dray: Hey. Really solid execution this quarter when many of your peers have struggled.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Deanne Dray: It was interesting on Allison 's (ph) question there we actually had to drag it out of you that there was a 50 million push out on revenues. We've seen that. And also we've seen where that is like a rolling push-out in -- from 4Q into the first quarter, but I like how the fact that wasn't an excuse. You still put-up strong numbers, so congrats there.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Deanne Dray: A couple of questions. There is this thought here on the supply chain issues for companies like AMETEK that are higher up the value chain, you're not doing raw material conversions. You're more final test and assembly. So it's the components supply might be -- the impact, might be felt later, so that it -- this might become more of an issue for component supply in the coming quarters. We know it's chip-related already, but is there any sense we think it gets worse from here? Again, where you are on the value chain?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, I don't see it getting worse. As I mentioned, it was worse in Q3 than Q2, but things seem to have stabilized. The comment that I'd make is, it's a good one of your question. And inflation is a concern related to our backlog, but we think it's manageable even with the high-level components. And the first key for me is that you have firm supplier pricing for items in the backlog as much as possible, so you know what your costs are going to be. And then we do have some commodities that we use in various areas, and when possible and we have firm orders, we'll buy forward certain key commodities to locking costs where appropriate.  We're using surcharges to handle increases in shipping costs, increases in transportation costs, higher energy costs, etc. We shortened the length of our quotation validity, the valid time our quotations are out there. So items can be repriced if necessary. And then you take into account the higher costs. And when you can and it's necessary, our customers have been fairly receptive to get to get a price increase due to what's happening right now. So I put that all package together and if we're a bit later than some of the component businesses that may be true.  But at the same time, we're willing -- running well ahead of inflation with our pricing and we plan to stay there and that's going to be a big part of our budgeting process that we're going through. And to understand what's happening in the market, to understand inflation and with 3.5% of price and 2.5% inflation across our entire businesses, I think we're focused on it, and I think we're doing a good job of it, and I think we'll stay in front of it.
Deanne Dray: That's really helpful. And you mentioned budgeting process. I'd be interested in hearing how the budgeting process for 2022 might be tempered given these circumstances on the supply chain. Would it be the top line being these rolling push outs? Would it also be margins with the labor issues? Just how does this all change your planning assumptions for 2022? And then maybe if you could just give us a comment on October, that would be helpful also.
Dave Zapico: Okay. I will talk about the, I guess our preliminary thoughts on 2022 and, you know, Deanne, we operate in niche markets and we have a comprehensive budgeting process that allows us to understand the market dynamics of these niches in a detailed level. And we begin that process later this month and that process is going to inform our guidance for 2022. In terms of the macro setup, we believe the economic recovery continues. We think overall it's a good macro environment for us. We think the mid-cycle recovery continues.  We think that we'll start to see longer cycle improvement and our Commercial Aero business, our process industries will continue to recover. We're expecting a stable defense spending environment. In terms of some of the headwinds that you mentioned, the challenges from inflation are going to continue and we're going to have to continue to offset inflation with price. And the supply chain may constrain growth. Mainly in the first half of the year. And as I mentioned before, semiconductor availability is a key issue for us. And we remain the final thing as we remain active in capital deployment with significant Balance Sheet capacity with a primary focus on M&A.  So we're really bullish about what we're going to be able to accomplish in 2022 and there's a couple of challenges out there, headwinds, mainly the supply chain that we're actively managed now, but we're still feeling good about 2022.
Deanne Dray: And comments on October?
Dave Zapico: The comments on the cadence throughout the quarter in October. September was the strongest month of the quarter. It was also the strongest month of the year-to-date and sale -- in the orders. And sales grew sequentially through the quarter with September being strongest month of the quarter. And October was very solid. It was supported of the trend required to meet our guide for Q4, so we're very pleased with how October turned out, and it showed no slowdown at all.
Deanne Dray: Really helpful. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Deanne.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
David: Good morning. This is David Ridley -Lane on for Andrew. Can you give us some additional color on revenue by end-markets and geographies?
Dave Zapico: Sure. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that was a broad-based growth and I'll take a walk around the Company, David. And you look at our process businesses, they were up high teens on a percentage basis in the third quarter, and they were driven by low teens or organic sales growth, and the contribution from the acquisition of Magnetrol. And our process businesses continue to see broad-based growth, with particularly strong growth within our ultra-precision technologies businesses as new products and differentiated measurement technologies are really driving solid demand across a wide range of markets, including the semiconductor and optics market.  For the full year for process, we now expect to be up low double-digits versus the prior year. Our next major market segment is the aerospace and defense market. And overall, we were up 55% in the third quarter driven by solid organic sales and the contribution from the acquisition of Abaco.  Organic sales were up high single-digits on a percentage basis versus the prior year. And solid growth in our commercial aftermarket business and our business ship businesses. Those were the 2 areas of strong growth. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-single-digit organic sales growth for aerospace to -- and defense businesses. And we expect our defense businesses to be up high single-digits and our commercial businesses to be up low single.  So the defense business is still stronger, but it's moderating a bit, and the commercial businesses had a good quarter. Go to the power and industrial market segment next, up nearly 40% in the quarter, driven by mid-20s organic sales growth, so they had a very good quarter. Also, acquisitions from NSI and Crank Software contributed. And for all of 2021, we now expect mid-teens organic growth for our power and industrial businesses. And finally, our Automation and Engineered Solutions business and both overall and organic sales were up approximately 25% accelerating from the prior quarter. Sales across our automation businesses remained robust with strong demand continuing in their end markets.  And for all the 2021, we now expect organic sales for our automation in the engineer solutions businesses to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis with stronger growth across our automation businesses than our engineered solutions businesses. The automation business is doing very well, as customers want to remove labor from the processes, they want to move things contamination free. We're at capacity. We've invested in the past in the late technologies that are winning share so -- and we're very good at moving things quickly and precisely.  So the automation business is in a really good position with a strong backlog and we're bullish about the future. You mentioned geography. I'll go around the geographies -- a strong broad-based growth across geographies where every geography was up. The U.S. was up 15%, Europe was up 15%, and the star for the quarter was Asia. It was up 25% with broad-based strength and -- notable strength in our process and automation businesses in Asia. That answer your question, David?
David: Perfectly. And then just a quick follow-up, You sort of alluded to it earlier in talking about mid-cycle. This is a pretty strange cycle, so maybe just -- you talk about some of the areas that you are looking for better organic growth in 2022 versus '21. I Imagine there would be some traditional longer-cycle areas like commercial Aero and oil and gas, but also maybe in this particular cycle, things that are tied to patient volumes and that sort of stuff.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I mean, it's -- you mentioned 3 of the areas that I think that we're improving, our commercial aerospace business, so we'll definitely improve our oil and gas business. It's only about 5% of AMETEK now, but it was up mid-teens in the quarter. And given where oil and gas prices are, we're beginning to see the signaling of the project business returning in 2022. So we're feeling good about that and in terms of the healthcare business.  Healthcare is 15% of AMETEK now, so it's our largest end market vertical. We're up mid-teens in the quarter. We had really solid growth in our rolling business, in our record business, really driven by new products and record. And the electrosurgery business, it picked up for us in Q3, so we were up in the quarter. It wasn't up 15%, it was up high single-digits, and we're benefiting from elective surgeries and things like neurostimulation, cardiac mapping, catheters, all that stuff as people are going back to hospitals getting those procedures done, and we expect that to grow -- this quarter was high single-digit number. We expect that to grow more next year.  So you've hit the key issues. Commercial, aerospace, oil and gas, the medical elective surgeries. But I don't think the mid-cycle is done growing yet either, and we're starting to see acceleration in that business across some of our process businesses.
David: Perfect. Thank you so much and congratulations on the quarter.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glenn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glenn: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glenn: Hey, Dave. So results really answer a lot of questions in principle. I was actually curious. Any particular areas of share gain or areas of market space creation you want to comment on? You mentioned automation a little bit, just kind of looking to expand on those.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I would say that when you can deliver your customers give you more orders. And that's the key issue driving our business right now. And when I look at the automation business, I talked about that earlier, that business is doing extremely well. Because of the broader macro, people want to remove labor from the processes. They don't want to be dependent on labor because in some places you can't hire labor and difficult to maintain. You’re at-capacity now, so there's more automation in both discrete automation and factory automation.  We've invested in the right technologies in the last few years, and acquired the right businesses, and we put them together. We have a really compelling value proposition, and we can design customized sub-assemblies that do automation very quickly and efficiently. And that business is doing the right things right now. So we're pretty bullish on the outlook for it. Does that answer your question, Chris (ph)?
Christopher Glenn: I was curious if there are any other particular areas even if more illustrative than moving the top line by themselves because maybe it's in a discrete niche business, but might speak to illustrate the AMETEK growth model,
Dave Zapico: Right. I think another area that we're starting to see traction in is some of our sustainability solutions. And if you look at our sustainability report, we've done some good work highlighting them. But in the case of greenhouse gas emissions and trying to understand that, we have some instrumentation that's very unique in helping researchers understand the trajectories, In terms of China, the pollution generated from heavy industrial processes requires very durable emissions equipment. That emissions equipment is selling very well for us now in China. So the sustainability solutions will be another thing that we're starting to get our hands around, but it's growing pretty rapidly.
Christopher Glenn: Great. Thanks for the [Indiscernible]
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Sufia Abdul Rauf: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Good morning.
Sufia Abdul Rauf: Congrats on the awesome quarter. I'm on for Nigel Coe. So really around M&A, do you see any updated thoughts around M&A accretion in fiscal year '22 from your deals this year?
Dave Zapico: No, I think the -- we had talked about the M&A accretion being about $0.18 from deals this year. And I think that we're still in line to deliver that. And Akhil's businesses that we have acquired, we're very pleased with them and they are -- each of these businesses is going to benefit from custom play book developed for them as part of our integration process. And we'll also benefit from AMETEK 's global footprint. And it's early in the ownership, but so far they're integration nicely and we're very bullish with all the businesses. I think in terms of 2022 I'm going to throw that in the bucket of we're going to go through and analyze everything from the all of our business units with our detailed budgeting process. And once we understand everything, we'll come back and communicate that to you.
Sufia Abdul Rauf: Gotcha. And then around EIG sales for the quarter. Do you see that normal seasonal uptick in sales for fourth quarter?
Dave Zapico: There is a bit of seasonality for EIG in the fourth quarter, so you'll see a bit of that.
Sufia Abdul Rauf: All right. Well, that's it from me. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Shlosh with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew Shlosh: Hey, there. This is Andrew Shlosh on for Jeff Sprague. How are you?
Dave Zapico: Hi, Andrew.
Andrew Shlosh: Just have a couple of quick ones for me, You said the elective surgery business is up high single digits. Do you have a great feel for where electric -- elective procedure volumes are versus 2019?
Dave Zapico: I can't comment on that right now. I can tell you that the business in the first half of the year was -- it was about flattish for us to down a bit. It picked up in Q3 and that high single-digit range, and we expect further growth from here. And that's probably the best I am going to be able to give you.
Andrew Shlosh: No, that makes sense. I apologize if I missed it. Did you give rattle off some of the end-market detail on the research business?
Dave Zapico: I didn't specifically give the research, is within our process segment. The research business is about 10% of AMETEK. And what you see in that business is it's starting to grow again as people -- industrial research has been strong, but the university research has been impacted by COVID. And people are getting back to the university research environment and is starting to perform -- function normally. And I think the product introduction than we talked about with the Gatan is perfectly targeted at that market. So it's a good market for us. It's not up as much as the AMETEK average, but we're bullish on that market as it begins to heal and they get back to more normal business after COVID.
Andrew Shlosh: That's great. Appreciate the color there.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets, please proceed with your question.
Ken Newman: Hey, good morning, guys. It's Ken Newman on for Steve.
Dave Zapico: Oh, Ken, how are you doing?
Ken Newman: Good. How are you?
Dave Zapico: Good.
Ken Newman: I think you had mentioned an increase in the RD&E guidance for the year. I'm curious if you just talk about how much growth was driven by new products in the quarter and any color on where the vitality index has been?
Dave Zapico: Right. It's a good question, Ken. In the quarter, our vitality index was 24%, so pretty healthy level for us. And as I mentioned last quarter, we increased our spending on R&D and also on the sales and marketing initiatives that we have. And we have a lot of things that we're funding, and we're bullish and optimistic on them. So we're spending about 5.5% of sales. It's a healthy amount for an industrial business, but we think it gives us a couple of things. One is these new sales from -- new product sales, but also.  it gives us the ability to raise price because we're investing for our customers and we're going to have the latest products that have the most value for our customers. So the investments that we make, we also link to the pricing capability in our business. So that's an important factor for us.
Ken Newman: Okay. And when I think about the impact of shifting sales from out of the third quarter into the next one because of supply chain issues, does that impact the mix of new products coming to market at all or would you still expect any kind of material expansion in that vitality index?
Bill Burke: I think 24% is a pretty good level, but I'd like to see it, mid-twenties are probably what we're targeting and I think the -- in terms of new product introductions, to the extent that a new product introduction relies on electronics or semiconductors, it could be delayed, but it's broader than new products. It's across a semiconductor chip availability is the one area in particular that we're very focused on because of the challenges with the constrained supply.
Ken Newman: Right. And that kind of Segway’s pretty well into my next -- in my follow-up question. Just on the semiconductor shortage, obviously you've got a very diverse set of businesses that spreads the gamut of computing needs. As we think of the kinds of chips needed for the embedded computer business in Abaco versus your automation business, can you just give us an idea of how much of the semi exposure is toward more of the bleeding edge chips versus the trailing edge?
Bill Burke: Yeah, I think the microprocessors and the higher-end chips are the ones that are particularly -- the cheap availability is particularly an issue right now. But we have such a broad-based portfolio of products
Dave Zapico: and we're using different chips in different businesses so there's really not one chip or one product. It's just an -- it's not in the passive component, it's an active component, and it's in more of the microprocessors. But it affects our EIG business more than EMG. But that's something that we're focused on and we did a great job managing it in Q3. And as I said, we have a lot of people that we're -- have relationships that are over a long period of time. We're using our purchasing leverage and probably most importantly, if our product is not available, we use our engineering capability to qualify second sources, to find alternatives, we set up a group within our Company. It's both our Bangalore engineers and some of our engineers in Europe, and some of our engineers in the U.S. and there's a team that's quickly going through these things when product availability comes through. The one of the things that we've been able to differentiate versus maybe some other people in the market is we have the strong engineering capability that can work on these problems that they come up and solve them quickly.
Ken Newman: Good color. Thank you very much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the floor back to Kevin Coleman for any additional or closing remarks.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2021 AMETEK, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2020 or 2021 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization, and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of 2020, and the realignment charge taken in the first quarter of 2020. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter. Strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance let to a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations. We established record levels of sales, orders, operating income, and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. This performance comes as we are still early in our economic recovery, and reflects the outstanding efforts of our teams. We also ended the quarter with a record backlog driven by exceptionally strong and broad-based orders growth, providing strong visibility across our mid and long cycle business profile. The five acquisitions we completed earlier this year are integrating nicely, and are well-positioned to drive strong growth. Given our second quarter results and outlook for back-half of 2021, we have increased our sales and earnings guidance for the year. Now, let me turn to our second quarter results. Our businesses saw robust broad-based sales growth in the quarter. Overall, sales were a record $1.39 billion, up 37% over the same period in 2020. Organic sales growth was 25%; acquisitions added 10 points to growth, while foreign currency added two points. Overall, orders in the quarter were a record $1.91 billion, a sharp increase of 92% over the prior year, while organic orders were an impressive 44% up in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.5 billion, which is up over $700 million from the start of the year. Our businesses also delivered exceptional operating performance in the quarter. While global supply chains remain tight, our businesses are doing a fantastic job managing through these challenges, as is reflected in our results. Second quarter operating income was a record $317 million, a nearly 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020, and operating margins expanded 40 basis points, to 22.8%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins expanded an exceptional 160 basis points of 24%. EBITDA in the quarter was $387 million, up 34% over the prior year's second quarter, with EBITDA margins of 27.9%. This operating performance let to earnings of $1.15 per diluted share, up 37% over the second quarter of 2020, and above our guidance range of $1.08 to $1.10. Our businesses also generated strong cash flows in the quarter, which position us well to continue investing in our businesses and on strategic acquisitions. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow conversion was 114% in income. Let me revise some additional details of the operating group level. Both our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group delivered strong organic sales growth with excellent core margin expansion in the quarter. Sales for EIG were a record $934 million, up 44% over last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 27%, recent acquisitions added 16%, and foreign currency added nearly two points. EIG's second quarter operating income was $227 million, up 42% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins were 24.3%. Excluding acquisitions, EIG's core margins were 26.3%, expanding an impressive 170 basis points over the comparable period. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance. EMG's second quarter sales increased 24% versus their prior year, to $452 million. Organic sales growth was 21%, and currency added three points to the quarter. Growth was broad-based across our EMG businesses, with particularly strong growth in our Advanced Motion Solutions business. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was a record $112 million, up 32% compared to the prior-year period and EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 170 basis points to record 24.9%. Now switching to our acquisition strategy, as we noted during our previous call, we completed the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI-MI at the beginning of the second quarter. These acquisitions, as well as the first quarter acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software, and EGS are performing very well, and the integration work for these businesses is progressing as expected. AMETEK's strong cash flow generation continues to bolster our capacity for capital deployment, including investment in strategic acquisitions. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently through a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities, and we expect to remain active over the balance of the year. Additionally, we're continuing to make key investments in support of our organic growth initiatives. We remain committed to investing in research, development and engineering of our advanced technology products, and to continue to providing our customers with innovative solutions and maintaining our leading positions in niche markets and applications. In the second quarter, we invested $72 million in RD&E and for the full-year we now expect to invest more than $300 million or approximately 5.5% of sales. For all of 2021, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in incremental growth investments. In addition to RD&E, this total investment includes our finance sales and marketing functions, along with investments to help drive our digital transformation and allow our businesses to accelerate growth. As noted, operating performance in the second quarter was outstanding with strong core margin expansion, despite having to absorb the return of temporary costs into our cost structure. While we were seeing higher levels of inflation, due to the tightness of the global supply chain, we're capturing higher levels of price given our differentiated solutions, allowing us to maintain a healthy price versus inflation spread. Additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our various operational excellence initiatives. For the full-year, we now expect approximately $145 million of operational excellence savings. Now, moving to our updated outlook for the remainder of 2021, given our strong performance in the second quarter, along with our order momentum and record backlog, we have again raised our 2021 sales and earnings guidance. For the full-year, we now expect overall sales to be up approximately 20% and organic sales up approximately 10% over 2020. Diluted earnings per share for 2021 are now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.68, an increase of 17% to 18% over 2020's comparable basis, and above our prior guide of $4.48 to $4.56 per diluted share. For the third quarter, we anticipate that overall sales will be up in the mid-20% range versus the same period last year. Third quarter earnings per diluted share are now expected to be between $1.16 to $1.18, up 15% to 17% over last year's third quarter. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were superb with excellent sales and order growth and high quality earnings growth exceeded expectations. Our strong operating performance in the first-half of the year shows the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated technology solutions and market leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through difficult economic cycles and emerge as a stronger company each time. The proven sustainable nature of the AMETEK growth model continues to drive long-term success for all of AMETEK's stakeholders. I'll now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter and we'll be glad to take your questions, Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the second quarter, with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance, and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $22.5 million, up $5.6 million from the prior-year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.6% for the quarter, versus 1.7% in the same period last year. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be approximately $15 million -- or expected to be up approximately $15 million on higher compensation costs. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6%, compared to 19.5% in the same quarter last year. The higher rate was driven by the impact of a U.K. range and the associated remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Our businesses continue to manage their working capital exceptionally well. For the quarter, working capital was 13.9% of sales, down an impressive 570 basis points from the 19.6% reported in the second quarter of 2020. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $23 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million for the full-year. Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $75 million. For all of 2021, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $141 million or $0.61 per diluted share. As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $287 million, and free cash flow was $264 million, with free cash flow conversion in the quarter a very strong 114% of net income. Total debt at quarter end was $2.96 billion, offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $390 million. As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisitions of Abaco Systems, and NSI-MI. This was in addition to the acquisitions of EGS, Crank Software, and Magnetrol which were completed in the first quarter of the year. Combined, we have deployed approximately $1.85 billion on five strategic acquisitions thus far in 2021. At quarter end, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio and our net debt to EBITDA ratio were 1.9 times and 1.6 times, respectively. Remain well-positioned to deploy additional capital and invest in our acquisition strategy given our strong financial capacity and flexibility. At quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, our businesses delivered excellent results in the second quarter that outperformed our expectations. The performance of our businesses through the first-half of the year, along with our strong balance sheet, tremendous cash flow generation, and the dedication of our world-class workforce has positioned the company exceptionally well for meaningful growth in 2021, and beyond. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Michelle, we're ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. A couple of questions, Dave, you mentioned price costs, but could you talk about what sort of spread you actually experienced in Q2? What your realization was in terms of price year-on-year, and whether you're contemplating any incremental pricing actions or surcharges in the back-half?
Dave Zapico: Great question, Matt. In the second quarter, we were very pleased that our pricing continues to offset inflation. We achieved about 3% of price across our entire portfolio, and total inflation was about two points. So, we had about a 100 basis point positive spread. And we want to stay in front of it. We want to stay there. And with all the acquisitions that we did and all the costs from those acquisitions, it showed up. We had 170 basis points of core margin expansion. And that pricing really helped us deliver that. So, we're ahead of the game now, we plan on staying there. There is increasing inflation, but with the 3% pricing and the 2% inflation, we were very pleased with our performance during the quarter.
Matt Summerville: And then just as a follow-up, can you speak to the organic order cadence you experienced over the course of the quarter? And if you can give us a read on maybe what you saw in July? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes, sure. I mean as we said before, the organic orders were up substantially. During the quarter, they grew every month, with June being the strongest month of the quarter. Sales also grew every month sequentially. And June was also the strongest month of the quarter, and so a very strong trend during the quarter. And then with July, it was a very solid month, and was supportive of our forecast and guide. So, we feel real good about the orders trend in the business.
Matt Summerville: Great. Thank you, guys.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Josh.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Dave, just on the inflation discussion, I guess the material side is only one piece of it. You have labor, you have logistics costs, there's kind of a cocktail of things in there.
Dave Zapico: Right.
Josh Pokrzywinski: How should we think of 2Q as being kind of the high watermark of inflation for the year relative to the back-half? Like when does that [indiscernible] or perhaps get a little easier?
Dave Zapico: Yes, the number that I gave you, the 2%, is total inflation in our business, so that's not just material, that's total inflation. And then in terms of peaking out, I mean it's -- inflation is increasing, we're staying in front of it. I don't think we're ready to say it's peaked yet. I think that there is an element of temporary cost spiking, but it's very difficult to bifurcate that between the underlying inflation and what's happening on a temporary basis. So, the honest answer is we're not sure, but we're going to stay ahead it. And that's the way we're managing the business.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then just in terms of the end markets or customer behaviors that are standing out. This recovery seems unusual in a few different ways, but are you guys seeing kind of the classic more CapEx-facing applications or industries bounce back or is it all just sort of in the mix together? Or anything you could sort of comment on that would be helpful.
Dave Zapico: Yes, great. Yes, what we're seeing is kind of -- we saw this quarter the beginning of what I think is classic mid cycle recovery. So, we're mainly mid cycle and long cycle businesses, and we're seeing the beginning of a mid cycle recovery. And what we saw on our businesses are our automation and engineered solution businesses, those were classic mid cycle. That picked up earlier in the year, and it's staying strong. But we saw during the quarter, our power business really picked up. And the organic growth of our power business was a strong mid 30% organic growth, so that's -- I think the cycle is kind of following along what we think, where our automation businesses would kind of lead us in, and then we have the process and power businesses. And then down the road, maybe even a year or two we have our commercial aerospace business. So, the cycle is kind of following what we think. It's a little bit difficult to bifurcate the classic cycle from customers trying to get in the queue and reacting to supply chain issue, and the COVID rebound that we're all seeing. But I'm feeling really confident. And the underlying demand strength can have a longer tail as part of a broader cycle, because I think the industrial world has not invested a lot over the last five years, and we're well-positioned to benefit from that investment. So, I'm kind of seeing beneath this COVID recovery the -- a classic cyclical recovery, and it's really hitting our businesses at the part of the cycle where we think it would be. Does -- so that help you out a little bit?
Josh Pokrzywinski: Perfect, great color. Thanks, Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning.
Allison Poliniak: I just want to go back to your comment on the incremental investment into the business. Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of where that incremental investment is going, is it specific verticals or is it much more broad spread, just any additional color would be helpful?
Dave Zapico: Sure. As we said, we're putting about $100 million of incremental investment in our P&L. And that was raised about $5 million from the last quarter, so some new opportunities are coming up. And I'd put it in several areas. I mean we're investing in core product development. That's the future of our business, and we want to stay with the best benefits in our products with our customers. That's happening, that's about probably a third of that $100 million. And then the other two-thirds is in sales and marketing and our digitization effort. So, we're doing a lot of things to improve our customer-facing capability. We're doing a lot of things around digital marketing, our sales force effectiveness. And teams are motivated and is working well, and we've able to do continued investing during the depths of the virus, and we're accelerating now. So, it's $100 million, it's in product development, and it's in sales and marketing, but a lot of it is in the digital space.
Allison Poliniak: Great. And then just a little bit -- see if you could give a little color on maybe more the commercial aerospace marketing. I know we're getting a lot of concerns with the Delta variant. Has that altered your view in terms of the recovery of either the MRO or just the commercial aerospace market in general?
Dave Zapico: Great question. The commercial aerospace is about 7% of our portfolio now. And we're obviously watching that Delta variant very closely, because we're not sure exactly what's going to happen. We haven't seen a downturn yet from the Delta variant. And our commercial aerospace business had a very good quarter. I mean we were up 25% in commercial aerospace. Our aftermarket business and our business jet market were stronger than our OEM markets. And that business, for the year, we haven't changed our outlook for the year. For our whole aerospace and defense business, we're still staying up low-to-mid single digits, so we're not seeing the same kind of traction in that business right now, partially because the aftermarket is doing better than the OE business. But it's stabilized for sure, it's 7% of our business, and we're watching it closely with the Delta variant. I mean we haven't seen a change yet in passenger model, but that could happen. So, that's the best information I can give you.
Allison Poliniak: Great. Thanks so much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Scott Graham: Thank you. Hi, Dave, Bill, and Kevin.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Graham: Good morning to you. So, I was just wondering, could you kind of quantify what the add-backs of the temporary reduction costs from last year were in the second quarter and maybe a feel for the second-half?
Dave Zapico: Yes, the best way I can answer is we talked about, last year; we had about $90 million in temporary costs that we removed from the P&L. Now we're at, fast-forward to the end of Q2, so about a month ago, they came in during the quarter. But by the end of the quarter they were pretty much all backend, except out travel expenses. So there was about $10 million or $15 million of travel expenses. They're bleeding in slower than we anticipated earlier in the year, but largely all the expenses, besides travel, are back in the P&L.
Scott Graham: So, correct me, if you would, on the math on that. So, we will see some add-backs in the third quarter and fourth quarter, but on a declining basis?
Dave Zapico: Yes, that there'll definitely be add-backs because we'll get full quarter effects, and there will also be some headwinds from our compensation system. We're -- we budget, we target our compensation systems, and we're having a good year, so there's a headwind from that too. So, there'll be some additional costs in the second-half of the year that will impact that.
Scott Graham: Got it, thank you. Would you mind giving us, Dave, a sketch of what your research market looks like right now?
Dave Zapico: Yes, the research market is doing well. It's starting to pick up a bit. But that market is probably more impacted than the classic industrial market, because a lot of the research institutions were slow to start up. There's difficulty getting access to the facilities. So, the market is hanging in there, it's doing well. But it's certainly not inflecting up as much as in the general industrial markets.
Scott Graham: Okay, thank you. And then, lastly, on the acquisition pipeline. I know you talked about the $2 billion of availability. What does that number look like in terms of the capacity, because, certainly, you can borrow some more, and what have you, and -- but more importantly, what does the quality of the pipeline look like right now? You talked about, on the last call, the possibility of doing in the second-half something close to what you did in the first-half. Could you update us on that thinking? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Yes, our teams are very active now. And we certainly -- we'd like to get a deal done between now and the end of the year, but there's no guarantee on that. There's a lot of properties in the market, there's a lot of activity going on right now for sure, but finding those gems that we acquire and end up becoming a part of the AMETEK portfolio is a different story. As we told you before many times, our acquisition strategy is not capital-limited, it's finding the right acquisitions to acquire, and we're very active now, and our teams are doing a great job. In terms of the capacity to-do deals, maybe I'll have Bill comment on that.
Bill Burke: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Yes, certainly, you made the point, we could go borrow more, and our banks and others tell us they're more than happy to lend to us. That couple of billion dollars would still only give us a mid-twos kind of leverage. So, still you could even say somewhat underleveraged for the company. So, plenty of opportunity and plenty of resources available to us to do even more than the $2 billion, and I think as Dave mentioned, this isn't a capital-constrained strategy, this is finding the right businesses to fit with our portfolio that we think can generate value for our shareholders over the long-term.
Scott Graham: Yes. Okay. Thank you, both.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Obin: Hi. Yes, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Just a question, just putting a couple of things together, you've said, you are adding to growth investments. And I know what it takes for AMETEK to sort of loosen its first strings. You did talk about underinvestment among the industrials over the past five years. Looking forward, do you see structurally high need for CapEx over the next couple of years from your customers?
Dave Zapico: Yes, there could be. There could be yet a situation where you had the industrial recession in the 2015-2016 timeframe. And then we had a few years of good growth, but then we had the pandemic. So, clearly, supply chains are stressed and people are going to put -- they're dealing with the current issues, but there's going to be some capacity put in. And I think that that could be one of the outcomes of this economic cycle that we're in. So, we're pretty bullish on the industrial cycle right now. And we think there -- as I mentioned earlier, there is a COVID bounce, and it's pretty difficult to bifurcate the COVID bounce from the long-term growth, but we certainly are seeing customers planning in a way that's different than just a bounce.
Andrew Obin: Thank you. And then the follow-up question, I mean people ask me about Delta variant impact on aerospace, but I think there are also some headlines in Asia, people trying to figure out if Delta variant is having any impact on rate of growth in Asia, and China specifically. Could you just talk about what it is you're seeing in China, Asia, not only as end market, but also what are you hearing from your supply chain? Is Delta variant sort of something that you're tracking in that region? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes, during the second quarter we had a pretty good month in Asia -- pretty good quarter in Asia, we were up about 30%. And it was a broad-based strength. It was notable strength in many of our businesses, but our automation business and our process instruments business stood out. And specifically within Asia, China growth was up 27%. So, it remains strong. And in China, our process instrumentation businesses did very well. So, we're still seeing solid growth in China. We've understand the press reports as well as anybody about what's going on in those regions. We're still operating all of our plants. We do have pockets where we're dealing with some COVID issues right now. But it's not unlike it's been the past three or four months, except the fact that there's probably a little more spread in China now. So, we're watching that closely, and -- but to your point, the China growth remains strong for us, 27% was the growth in the quarter.
Andrew Obin: Really appreciate the answers. Great quarter, thanks a lot.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Sprague: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Sprague: Good morning. Just coming around to the deals and actually what you've done year-to-date, I think you were previously thinking about $0.18 or so accretion this year and a carryover benefit of $0.35 to $0.38 and into next year. Just wondering now that these assets are actually fully in-house and you're betting them down, does that outlook change much and does anything in particular stand out?
Bill Burke: No, I think the same outlook. It's we haven't changed it at all. And we said, we get about $0.18 of benefit in 2021, and it's looking like that's going to be a good number for us.
Jeff Sprague: Great. And then just coming back to kind of supply chains that, I'm sorry, I was on the call a few minutes late, but was there any place in the portfolio where you were unable to kind of meet demand or there was issues up and down the supply chain somewhere else where perhaps even you could deliver, but the customer didn't necessarily want it because of their own issues with deliverability and availability?
Dave Zapico: Yes. There were issues like that going on all over Jeff, but I'd say that in general, in the second quarter, our teams did an excellent job and we had the material and we had the labor and we had the execution to get out what we needed to. There are certainly challenges in that broader materials and logistics right now, our guidance reflects the known risks. These issues are going to be with us for some period of time. And we're managing the issue with dedicated business unit personnel. So, each business unit has a team on their supply chain, but we also have an overlay over company-wide resources or global sourcing team and they're doing an effective job right now. The big area of focus for us right now is on semiconductor chip availability. And we're looking at that very closely trying to do secure our supply chains. And you can end up with a situation where you think you have a firm delivery and the day comes from the delivery and it's not there. I think everybody in the industrial world is delivering with that right now. And it causes with me a game of Whac-A-Mole where you're scrambling to get your output out but our people did a good job in the second quarter. And there is an element of prudent judgment in our second-half guide. But our guidance reflects all of our known risks.
Jeff Sprague: Great. I appreciate the perspective. Thanks a lot.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question on the line of Christopher Glenn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Christopher Glenn: Thanks. Good morning, Dave, Bill, and Kevin. So I just wanted to clarify Dave, I think you said June had the highest rate of year-over-year orders and sales organic growth. I would've thought the comps got, got steeper from April through June. So one just wanted to clarify and two what's implied there if you're accelerating on steeper comps.
Dave Zapico: Yes. I may have said the wrong thing if I said acceleration of the orders, both orders and sales grew sequentially every month, but June being the highest strongest month of the quarter. So, that doesn't mean that they're ready to change; accelerated, that means that June was higher the May, May was higher than April, for both orders, and we had a very strong trend in July also.
Christopher Glenn: Okay. Thanks. I might've heard you right. And then just wanting to go into your advanced motion controls, motion solutions, you talked about front end investment there. I'm curious what you're seeing in terms of the types of automation architectures. There are changes going there. Is that coming your way in particular, had increasing front end competitiveness, just curious kind of panoramic of that automation space?
Dave Zapico: Yes. A lot of what we're doing is discrete automation and we've also done some factory automation and we've invested heavily over the past few years. So position our product portfolio and our capability at the top of the market, and we're benefiting from it now because as customers ramp up, our automation technology is helping them better serve their customer bases and the demand has been strong for many quarters. And we don't expect that to change.
Christopher Glenn: Okay. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: So I actually also had a question just on the comments on industrial investment in CapEx, etcetera. I'm a little bit curious if you flush it out. Are you hearing the desire to spend coming back from your customers? There may be some technology changes that are encouraging automation, localization and so forth. And I'm just curious if that's kind of where you think things will go based or whether you're hearing it strongly. And then just maybe a comment on breadth of industry, I don't know if that's focused a little bit more on pharma and medical or wide across the businesses, do you have an insight into. Thank you. Bye.
Dave Zapico: Yes, the first point is I think localization of manufacturing and people developing more durable supply chains is definitely one of the drivers of the demand we're seeing. What was your second question Rob? It was the 
Rob Wertheimer: Well, so whether technology changes are also doing it and then breadth of portfolio.
Dave Zapico: Breadth of portfolio, so again, the first part of the question, we're definitely seeing localization drive demand. Those people look for more durable, more local supply chains. What we're really seeing it, if you go through our portfolio, look let's start with our process businesses with our largest business. It grew mid-20s organic during the quarter. Really strong levels demand essentially all MRs, leading to really robust sales and orders. Our growth was particularly strong in one of our instrumentation businesses called our ultra precision technology business that had a great quarter and they're benefiting from a metrology measurement technology related to automation. And you think about the power and industrial business, that business was up 30% organic in the quarter. The businesses that did well there, both segments power and industrial and particularly strong growth in our Brookfield business and our [indiscernible] business. Again, that was broad-based. And the power and industrial business was kind of one of the lagers on orders to pick up. And we were really pleased to see that. And then we talked about our automation and engineer solutions business. They were up low-20s organic and that's been strong for a period of time with a robust and strong demand continuing. So, all of those are strong. Our aerospace and defense business had a really good quarter. The sales were up high teens on a percentage basis versus the prior year. So this is about 19% of our portfolio. Organic sales were up high teens on a percentage basis, a solid growth across all segments. As I mentioned as an answer to Allison's question earlier, our commercial business was up 25% and our defense business was up about 10%. And for all the 21 that business, we're still not changing. We're continuing to expect low-to-mid single digit organic growth. So if I pulled the aerospace and defense business outside of the portfolio, I'd say that's the one that's, it's bottomed and it's doing well. But we're still looking at that commercial OEM business and watching it bottom, but everything else besides that is showing an uptrend.
Rob Wertheimer: Great, thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thanks, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Yes. I was interested in the growth investments, the $100 million and you talked about like, two thirds of it going towards like the sales and marketing and digital aspects of your business. Are you seeing kind of coming out of COVID just given like the kind of bespoke nature of your products and like specialized nature of your products? Is there like a fundamental change in how you sell these? Like, is it going to be, you finding it easier to do it digitally and less like in-person and it just kind of like a -- see change in how you do business going forward?
Dave Zapico: I think there is a change Joe, and I think that digital transformation is impacting all elements of our business, and we have these different niche of businesses, but some of the technology and the sales and marketing functions applies to all of them. So from digital marketing to e-commerce to augmented reality use to a demo and service our products to the efficiency we're getting out of automating routine clerical tasks and remote process improvement. There's a lot of things going into the digital plans that we have, the digital transformation. So we have and they do impact all of our businesses. And it's kind of a theme across all of our independent niches. So we're focused a lot on improving the business in that area. And we did learn a lot during the pandemic downturn and or taking what we learned and we're making it better and we're institutionalizing some of our best practices.
Joe Giordano: And then, just a follow-up, in your Asia businesses, at least on the margins more recently, have you seen anything that kind of reflects the macro data, at least in China getting a little weaker here? Are you seeing anything like on the margins that that kind of mirror that, are you kind of changing the way you're operating there a little bit to kind of get ahead of that?
Dave Zapico: Yes, we're not changing anything yet. And we're not seeing a downturn. But China has been very strong, they were one of the first economies out of the pandemic. So we're looking at it closely. And as I mentioned, our growth was up about 27%. It remains strong, and we have strong quotation activity. I've seen all the reports about the Chinese economy slowing down, and there's probably some of that going on. But in our particular niches where we're playing, we have notable strength.
Joe Giordano: Thanks guys.
Dave Zapico: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, just in terms of some of the second-half dynamics, on some of the temporary costs coming back in, as well as higher incentive compensation, what does that do for expectations on incrementals?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think the core incrementals for the year are 35%. But in that second-half, we're going to have some costs coming back into the P&L. So the margins during the second-half can be down a bit, that is reflected in our guidance, but the acquisitions are margin dilutive, our temporary costs are coming back into the cost structure. And also, there's a bit of us being cautious in terms of our guide related to the dynamics of the supply chain. And as you may remember, Deane, we had a very tough, very difficult tough comparison in Q4. I think our EBITDA margins were over 30%. So we have tough comp also. So, there's going to be -- there can be a bit of margin dilution in that second-half, we got some of the one-time costs for the acquisitions working through the system. Those temporary costs we talked about are coming back in, but it's all reflected in our guidance.
Deane Dray: That's very helpful. And Dave, I think the key question that everyone would love to hear your comments on the supply chain challenges and you said, you expected to last for some period of time, just from what you're seeing today, across your businesses, how do you think this plays out, is this a multiple quarter, is it carry in to 2022, you're handling it well on price costs. But just your expectation here, how long these conditions last?
Dave Zapico: That's a great question, Deane, I think the semiconductor element of it can last longer, so that can go out to two, three, four quarters as capacity gets put in place. Not specific to semiconductor, but to broader supply chain challenges. Yes, I can see those moderating in a couple of quarters. But semiconductor could last a little bit longer.
Deane Dray: And are you carrying any more buffer inventory in your businesses just to kind of protect yourself from the surprises about, you expected the delivery, and it's not there. But is that and are we seeing that in the working capital?
Dave Zapico: Yes, the working capital was down about more than 500 basis points, but actually embedded in that was about $50 million more in inventory. So, we've allowed the operating teams guide and secure the parts that they need, and we're certainly not scrimping in that area. But at the same time, it's tough. They get the parts that you need. So we're managing it closely and as I said, we have a good team, both within our local business units combined with our corporate oversight, we're getting good results. But that is a big challenge for us right now.
Deane Dray: That's all good to hear. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Ken Newman: Hey, good morning, guys. It's Ken Newman on for Steve.
Dave Zapico: Hey, Ken good to hear you.
Ken Newman: Thanks. I just wanted to touch back on the semiconductor market comments you just made. Can you just remind us how big that market is for you today? And I'm curious if you just talk to the outlook for the sub sector in terms of capital investments from your customers?
Dave Zapico: I'll do that, Ken. But I want to be clear, what I was talking about was the semiconductor chips that are supplied to AMETEK, when I was talking about the supply chain tightness, but the semiconductor market is an important market for AMETEK. So we do participate in it from the viewpoint of sales and it's about 6% of our business. So, little under $300 million and we're seeing some solid growth there because we participate both in the research market and the ramp in chip production and application areas we're seeing particular strength would be the EUV optics market, the semiconductor research market, our businesses named CAMECA and ZYGO are doing quite well there and we expect our semiconductor sales to be up in the mid-teen 20% level this year.
Ken Newman: Understood. And then, just touching back on the incremental R&D investments for new product development for the year, can you give us some color on where your Vitality Index has trended through the quarter? And I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on how are you seeing that, how you see that the Vitality Index change, as these new investments start to monetize?
Dave Zapico: Yes, our Vitality Index in the quarter was a little better than 23%. So it was a good number. And we have to get our system put in place with some of these acquisitions that we've done. So there's the tracking systems that we put in place aren't in all the acquisitions yet. So we can't look at those businesses the same way, we look at our current businesses, but in general, we have a strong vitality, we have a number of in the low 20s, we're happy. And we think there's good opportunities for our businesses, and we're funding them and it's a big area for us is important for us as they get our product development teams, working together, introducing new products, because that's fundamental for both the AMETEK pricing story to be able to stay in front of inflation and also growing organic growth in the niche markets that we're leaders in. So it's really important to us.
Ken Newman: Thanks for the color.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Coleman for any further remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Michelle. Thank you everyone for joining our call today. Have a wonderful day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the AMETEK’s First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please note that today’s call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kevin, the floor is yours.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Jake. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK’s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today’s call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK’s filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2020 or 2021 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization, and also excluding the gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of 2020, and the realignment charge taken in the first quarter of 2020. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. We’ll begin today’s call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we’ll open it up for your questions. I’ll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
David Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent results in the first quarter with stronger than expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution leading to earnings above our expectations. We returned to organic sales growth earlier than expected and as the economy continues its recovery, we're experiencing strong orders growth resulting in a record backlog.  Operationally, our businesses are performing at a high level, delivering impressive margin expansion and strong cash flows. Additionally, we started the year with a notable level of acquisition activity, deploying a record $1.85 billion on five acquisitions thus far in 2021. These acquisitions, combined with our strong first quarter results and solid orders momentum, led us to substantially increase our full year sales and earnings guidance.  Before I get into the results for the quarter, I wanted to again thank all AMETEK colleagues for their continued hard work and efforts over the last year as we manage through the pandemic. AMETEK’s success in navigating this difficult environment is a testament to the dedicated and highly talented employees across the company.  While we are encouraged with the acceleration of the vaccine rollout, we remain focused on the health and well being of our employees and we'll remain vigilant in ensuring proper safety protocols are being followed.  Now, let me turn to the first quarter results. Overall, sales in the quarter were up 1% versus the prior year to $1.22 billion. Organic sales were up 1% with a divestiture of Reading Alloys being offset by a 2 point foreign currency tailwind.  Overall, orders in the quarter were a record $1.4 billion, up 16% compared to the same period last year with organic orders up 9%. This led to a book to bill of 1.15 and a record backlog of $2 billion.  We are encouraged by the strong orders as many of our businesses are seeing improved demand conditions across their markets, while some of our longer cycle businesses have yet to return to growth.  Operating income in the quarter was $293 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020. Operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 24.1%. EBITDA in the quarter was $356 million, up 4% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 29.2%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.07 per diluted share, up 5% versus the first quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $0.97 to $1.02. Cash flow in the quarter was also very strong, with operating cash flow up 5% to $284 million and free cash flow conversion of 122% of net income.  Let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group and Electromechanical Group reported outstanding results in the first quarter, with both groups delivering positive organic sales growth and impressive margin expansion.  Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group in the quarter were $791 million, up 2% over last year's first quarter, driven by modest organic sales growth and a 1.5% foreign currency tailwind. EIG’s operating income in the first quarter was $207 million, up 7% versus the same quarter last year, and operating margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 26.2%.  The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter with positive organic sales growth driven by strong demand in our automation business. EMG’s first quarter sales were $425 million, down 1% versus the prior year. Organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, while the divestiture of Reading Alloys was a 5 point headwind and foreign currency was a 2 point tailwind.  EMG’s operating income was a record $105 million in the quarter, up 8% compared to the same quarter last year. And EMG’s operating margins expanded an exceptional 190 basis points to a record 24.7%.  Now turning to acquisitions. As we have discussed, acquisition activity slowed considerably in 2020 due to the pandemic. During this time, we acted swiftly to appropriately align our cost structure with the demand environment and to protect and further strengthen our balance sheet to support a meaningful return of M&A in 2021.  At the same time, we communicated that our business and acquisition teams remain very active in managing our pipeline of acquisition opportunities. These actions positioned us to capitalize on an improving acquisition environment in a significant manner, deploying $1.85 billion to acquire five excellent businesses thus far this year.  Now, let me take a moment to provide additional color on these deals. I'll start with AMETEK’s largest ever acquisition, Abaco Systems. Headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, Abaco is the leading provider of mission critical embedded computing systems used on key aerospace and defense platforms, along with specialized industrial applications.  Abaco’s open architecture of computing and electronic systems are ruggedized to meet military standards and withstand harsh conditions, including extreme temperatures, altitude and high vibration.  As a leading provider of differentiated technology solutions serving attractive high growth applications, Abaco nicely complements and expands our existing aerospace and defense platform. Abaco has approximately 325 million in annual sales, and we deployed $1.35 billion on the acquisition.  Next, Magnetrol International. Based in Aurora, Illinois, Magnetrol is the leading provider of level and flow control solutions for challenging process applications across a diverse set of end markets, including medical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, food and beverage and general industrial markets. Magnetrol is an outstanding strategic fit with our sensors, test and calibration business. Combined, these businesses form an industry leading sensor platform with a broad range of level and flow measurement solutions. Magnetrol has annual sales of approximately $100 million, and we deployed $230 million on the acquisition.  Today, we announced the acquisition of NSI-MI Technologies, a leading provider of radio frequency and microwave test and measurement solutions based in Suwanee, Georgia. NSI-MI is an exciting addition to our test and measurement platform, given their deep expertise in advanced RF and microwave technologies.  Their highly differentiated test and measurement solutions are uniquely positioned to support the continued development of advanced RF and microwave technologies for critical high growth applications, including 5G wireless communications, autonomous vehicles and specialized defense systems. NSI-MI has annual sales of approximately $90 million, and we deployed 230 million on the acquisition.  In addition to these acquisitions, AMETEK also acquired two smaller yet highly strategic businesses, Crank Software and EGS Automation. Crank Software, which is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, is the provider of embedded graphical user interface software and services. Crank’s award winning storyboard software platform is ideally positioned to capitalize on the accelerating demand for smart digitally enabled devices. And EGS Automation is an attractive bolt-on acquisition for our Dunkermotoren business, expanding our presence in the attractive automation market. Located near Dunkers, German headquarters, EGS designs and manufactures highly engineered and customized robotic solutions for niche medical, food and beverage and general industrial markets.  We would like to welcome the Abaco, Magnetrol, NSI-MI, Crank Software and EGS teams to AMETEK and look forward to working closely with them and supporting their continued growth. Combined, these acquisitions add approximately 535 million in annual sales aligned with attractive secular growth markets. Additionally, they provide AMETEK with excellent returns in line with our stated hurdle rates. Each of these integrations is going very well in the early stages of our ownership.  AMETEK’s decentralized operating structure and proven operating capability provides us the flexibility to successfully integrate the businesses, while continuing to pursue additional acquisitions. We're still working through a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. And as Bill will discuss in a moment, we have ample balance sheet capacity with approximately $1.8 billion available to support our acquisition strategy.  In addition to continued capital deployment on acquisitions, we also remain committed to investing in our businesses. For all of 2021, we expect to invest approximately 95 million in incremental growth investments. These investments are largely centered around our research and development and sales and marketing functions, including targeted investments in support of our digital transformation strategy.  Our investments in RD&E continued to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets. For all of 2021, we expect to spend approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales on RD&E for our base businesses before adding in our recent acquisitions. This level of spend is up 10% over last year's RD&E spend.  Now shifting to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the first quarter, including solid orders growth and a record backlog, along with contributions from our recent acquisitions, we've increased our full year sales and earnings guidance. For 2021, we now expect overall sales to be up high teens on a percentage basis while organic sales are expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $4.48 to $4.56, which is an increase of 13% to 15% over last year's comparable basis. This new range is a $0.28 midpoint increase from our previous adjusted earnings guidance of $4.18 to $4.30 per diluted share.  For the second quarter, overall sales are anticipated to be up in the low 30% range versus last year's quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.10, up 29% to 31% over last year’s second quarter. Our revised guidance includes each of the five completed acquisitions.  To summarize, AMETEK delivered an excellent first quarter with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion, a high quality of earnings and meaningful capital deployment. These outstanding results speak to the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model along with the resilience of our world class workforce.  With our differentiated technology solutions serving a diverse set of niche end markets aligned with attractive secular growth opportunities, we remain firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth.  I will now turn it over to Bill who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then, we will be glad to take your questions. 
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK began the year with outstanding results highlighted by strong sales and orders growth and a high quality of earnings. With that, I'll provide additional financial highlights for the quarter.  First quarter general and administrative expenses were $18.6 million, up $3 million from the prior year, largely due to higher compensation expense. As a percentage of total sales, G&A was 1.5% in the quarter. For 2021, general and administrative expenses are now expected to be up approximately $12 million on a return of temporary costs, including compensation. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5%, which was essentially in line with the adjusted 19.4% reported in the same period last year. For 2021, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.  Our businesses continue to do an outstanding job managing their working capital. For the quarter, operating working capital was 14.2%, down 470 basis points from the 18.9% reported in the first quarter of 2020, just excellent work by our teams on the working capital front. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $18 million. For the full year, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $120 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter was $65 million. For all of 2021, we now expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $300 million, including after tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $140 million or $0.60 per diluted share.  As Dave highlighted, our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash given our asset-light business model and strong working capital management. In the first quarter, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up 5% over last year's first quarter to $284 million and $267 million, respectively. Free cash flow conversion was very strong at 122% of net income in the quarter.  Total debt at quarter end was $2.35 billion, down from $2.41 billion at the end of 2020. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.7x and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9x.  As Dave noted, we've been very active on the acquisition front. During the first quarter, we deployed approximately $270 million on the acquisitions of Magnetrol, Crank Software and EGS Automation. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisition of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI, resulting in 1.85 billion in total capital deployed on strategic acquisitions thus far this year.  Also subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced we entered into a five-year delayed draw bank term loan for up to $800 million with existing lenders under our revolving credit facility. Proceeds from the term loan will be used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility following the recent acquisition activities, and to provide capital to further support our acquisition growth strategy.  Following the acquisitions of Abaco and NSI, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is expected to be 1.9x and 1.7x, respectively, at the end of the second quarter. We continue to have an excellent financial capacity with approximately $1.8 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter with high quality results that outpaced our expectations. We remain poised for significant growth in 2021, given our strong balance sheet, outstanding cash flows and the efforts of our talented workforce. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Jake, can we please open the line for questions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, could you maybe parse out the $0.28 change in guidance for the year? How much of that is being driven by a better than expected performance in the core business versus the M&A-driven accretion and all the deal flow as of late?
David Zapico: Yes, Matt. That's an excellent question. And it's really driven by a mix of different items. So we have the stronger than expected organic growth that drove Q1 of our guide. And then we have an improved guide for Q2. And both of those two together are about $0.10, $0.10 of the $0.28. Really, our second half is unchanged on a core basis. It's too early to change that. And then we have an additional $0.18 from the deal. So the way to think about that is [10%] (ph) from the core business, $0.18 from the deals, $0.28 in total. 
Matt Summerville: Perfect. And then just in terms of price realization, maybe where you're at in Q1, and then where you were at in terms of price cost spread and what you expect for the balance of the year. Thank you.
David Zapico: Thanks, Matt. We're very pleased with our pricing. It continues to offset inflation. We achieved a bit more than 1.5% of price across our entire business. Total inflation was a bit less than 1%. So we're maintaining a positive spread between the two, which is our intention. And when you look out for all of '21, we expect to achieve slightly higher pricing than the 1.5% with slightly higher inflation. So we see both our pricing and inflation building a bit, and we'll strive to maintain a positive spread between price and inflation for the full year. And it's really -- it's driven by the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio. We have leadership positions in these markets around the globe and provide excellent value to our customers. So when we get cost increases, more than likely we can pass them on.
Matt Summerville: Great. Thank you, Dave.
David Zapico: Thank you, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
David Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Dave, I’d love to get some context of this. And I’m not sure I'm supposed to use the word M&A spree, but it just -- a logjam has been broken here and maybe can you give us some context. Did the pricing get reasonable? You probably had all these assets on your radar screen before we went into COVID. So the lifting of COVID uncertainty certainly was a factor here. But just give us a context, because you don't often see a volume of deals that look to be great fits, but just happening in such a short amount of time.
David Zapico: Right. It's a great question. And I'll try to give you an overlay the way that we think about it. We've managed through many economic cycles and seeing the impact on M&A from the economic cycles. And it was no surprise then this particular downturn that deal activity dramatically slowed in 2020, and pent-up demand would drive a quick recovery. We talked about that last year. So our focus in 2020 was to make sure that we were well positioned for the rebound. And one of the ways we would be well positioned is we strengthen our balance sheet. And we built up our cash balances during the worst of the pandemic, and we exited the year with 1.2 billion in cash and net debt to EBITDA of 0.9.  Look, as we talked about last year, we also focused on expanding our pipeline of opportunities. And we told you last year, we were busier than ever with pipeline development. And as you stated we've been working with these companies for over a year on these deals. And just through the first four months, the sellers wanted to sell the businesses like we thought and we have a dedicated team of people that are working for them. So we acquired five companies, deployed 1.85 billion in capital and they're highly strategic. And we're really excited for each of the companies we acquired. They fit perfectly with our acquisition strategy. Each has strong differentiated technology positions. They allow us to expand in attractive growth areas like embedded systems for aerospace and defense, testing for autonomous vehicles, 5G satellite communications, expanding our IoT capability, more capability in automation business, software for embedded systems. So we're really happy with the set of companies that we acquired. And importantly, each of these businesses are going to benefit from being part of AMETEK. We've developed a custom playbook for each of the businesses. And they're going to benefit from our global footprint to help them accelerate the efficiencies.  Importantly for us, we were able to get the deals done. We’re meeting our traditional financial hurdles, which are a return on invested capital of 10% and an IRR of 15%. So these are important thresholds for us. And we want to ensure that we're providing strong level of returns on our capital deployed for shareholders. And one of the benefits of AMETEK’s distributed operating model is that we can handle a bunch of acquisitions like this to acquire and integrate multiple businesses, while remaining active and acquiring other businesses. These are coming into different parts of AMETEK, and there's a senior AMETEK leader responsible for the integration. And our pipeline of opportunities remains strong. And we have a meaningful level of capacity, as Bill talked about, with strong cash flow. So I hope we're talking to you before the end of year about some other things, but we felt real good about it. And it wasn't just -- it all happened at once. It's a lot of hard work over the course of the pandemic and of course of greater than a year.
Deane Dray: That's really helpful. And you answered my question about the additional management capacity, because I can see you've got the capital to do more deals. And you did answer the question about the management capacity, that was really helpful. And I may have missed this, but within the increased guidance, what is the earnings contribution from the deals?
David Zapico: Yes. If you think about the $0.28 midpoint rise on our guidance, $0.18 is from the deals this year and the other $0.10 is from the organic operations of the company.
Deane Dray: Got it. I appreciate it. Congrats on all that work.
David Zapico: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.
David Zapico: Good morning, Josh.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Dave, just to stick with the deals, I guess your first, Abaco, I guess we're getting to the point now where bolt-ons are starting to look a little bit less bolt-on and pretty large. Can you talk about maybe the complexion of the pipeline or maybe your own appetite to kind of be in that range maybe more consistently going forward? I think you've said it yourself that needle moving deals for AMETEK sort of have to get bigger over time, is that something that as you look out over kind of the range of properties that you think is possible, achievable, kind of consistent with the strategy here?
David Zapico: Yes, good questions. A few years ago, we let our investors know that we were expanding our deal pipeline to include slightly bigger businesses. And we included businesses that will be in the 200 million to 400 million range. And we deploy 1 billion plus capital on them, and Abaco is in that range. And we talked about doing a deal like that every so often. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to become our core, but those businesses are still working in our pipeline. But there are still many businesses that are, I’ll call them medium size that are the $100 million deals similar to NSI-MI and Magnetrol. Those are probably the most businesses of that size. And then we also had some smaller deals that they're really important strategically to operate and augment our internal growth. So you're going to see a mix of deals of those sizes. AMETEK is not going to buy a company our size or buy a company half our size. We just don't think that you can create value like that, but the size of the company now I think those companies in the $200 million to $400 million revenue makes sense, and you'll see those from us occasionally.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. And then just moving over to the core business, it seems like order intake picked up pretty nicely here. You talked about record backlog. I guess the perception out there or maybe the history of AMETEK has been slightly longer cycle than maybe some of these book-and-turn only businesses and orders that tend to develop along with a recovery, but not necessarily day one. It seems like you've built up a little bit of momentum here. Can you maybe talk about where is that backlog growth stemming from, or what out there fundamentally in the marketplace has maybe picked up a little quicker than you otherwise would have expected?
David Zapico: Right. When you -- I’ll first unpack the orders a bit. We had a 9% organic order growth and it was broad-based in the company and EIG organic orders was 10%, EMG organic orders was 8%. So it was good to see broad-based orders. When you think about our portfolio, both EIG and EMG, we raised from mid single digits to high single digits. That's another indication of broad-based growth. I think that the overall company will grow sales sequentially each quarter. And as we look at our four market segments, process improved high single digits; power and industrial improved high single digits; automation and engineering improved high single digits; but the aerospace and defense segment, we continue to expect low to mid single digits with defense growing better than commercial. So when you think about the entire business, it really is going well. And I carve out the two long cycle businesses, oil and gas that we think will trend up in the second half of this year and the commercial aerospace business which will not trend up until 2023, maybe 2022, 2023. But the key point is, we have properly sized that business for the current level of activity and any small improvements along the way are going to be very profitable for us. So we look at it as really attractive. We're going to have the long cycle businesses kicking in down the road and we're already seeing the mid cycle pick up. So we're feeling pretty optimistic about the recovery.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. Congrats on the quarter, all the deals and best of luck.
David Zapico: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Allison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning, guys.
David Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: And just sort of in line with that, sort of the mid and long cycle businesses, could you maybe talk about the core operating leverage that you expect to see this year based on some of the orders that are coming in for you, any color there?
David Zapico: Yes, that's a good question. We had excellent margin performance in the first quarter, strong margin improvements in both EIG and EMG, a strong execution, solid price inflation, excellent productivity. We're going to see for the year core incrementals of 35%, and that includes bringing all the temporary costs back into the business. And core operating margins will increase about 40 basis points. So we’ll grow margins. A key point though is the acquisitions are margin dilutive. So our reported margins will be down a bit, and that's kind of what we do. We acquire businesses that are lower margin than AMETEK. And over the course of a couple of years, three years, we bring them up to the AMETEK level when it's pretty hard to acquire businesses that are at the profitability level of AMETEK worth 29%, 30% EBITDA, and we have some room with all these businesses to improve profitability. So that's the way I think about the -- the core operating leverage on the business will be positive. And then the reported margins with the acquisitions will be margin dilutive.
Allison Poliniak: Got it, thanks. And then working capital, obviously, an impressive number at 14.2% of sales. Would we expect that to maybe slip a little bit with the increase or is that sort of a sustainable level as you think about it?
Bill Burke: Yes. Allison, I would expect that -- we'd expect that to probably come back. It would be adding some cost back to the balance sheet. Particularly as the sales grow, you're going to see some more receivables come on the balance sheet and we're going to be focused on making sure that we've got all the right inventory levels in the business to support the growth and make sure we're good to go and can support our customers as we move forward. So I think we did really well in the first quarter. I think -- while we did put receivables and inventories back up on the balance sheet, our teams did a great job getting advanced payments from customers and the like. So that was a good result, but I'd expect to see that trend up a bit over the course of the balance of the year.
Allison Poliniak: Understood. Thank you.
David Zapico: Thank you, Allison.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
David Zapico: Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe: Good morning. So I want to go back to deal flow, because it's obviously -- by the way, congratulations on all the deals. You source and buy a lot of private companies, family held companies, and I've got to think there's got to be an increased interest in selling businesses ahead of any cap gains, tax rate changes and [inherent] (ph) tax changes. Are you seeing that yet? Have you seen more interest in maybe pulling the trigger on some disposables with these changes on the horizon?
David Zapico: They're a little bit of that, Nigel. But what I see is a lot of private owners -- and there were some private owners in this suite of businesses that we bought, they got through the pandemic and they're looking at a world that's changed, and they're looking at someone larger to provide some stability and some capital and some access to things that they didn't have access to. So I think it's more the uncertainty in the macro environment, the uncertainty driven by the pandemic, has certainly made private company owners more likely to consider the exit that they were maybe going to do a couple of years from now. That's what I think is happening and we're seeing a little bit of that.
Nigel Coe: Okay, that makes sense. And then EMG margins moving notably higher, pre-pandemic we’re sort of in the high teens, maybe 20% range, and now we're moving into the mid 20s. Do you think that that level is sustainable? I understand Reading Alloys came out, but do you think mid 20s is sort of the range for EMG from here.
David Zapico: They were a record margin this quarter at 24.7%, up 190 basis points and their margins have been growing nicely for a period of time. And when you look at that part of the business and you dissect what happened, the two very profitable parts of that business, our automation business and our defense businesses, both are firing on all cylinders and that drove the margins up. So it's really a mix among businesses within the EMG group that is driving the margins. And as long as those businesses stay strong, I would expect the margins to be good.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Dave.
David Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.
Scott Graham: Hi. Good morning, Dave and Bill.
David Zapico: Good morning, Scott. How are you doing?
Scott Graham: All good. Always nice to wake up to this type of report. So I think we're about $50 million of temporary cost-outs last year. Bill, you touched on this a little bit within SG&A. How do you see those layering in this year?
Bill Burke: Yes, I think there was 90 actually that was the temporary cost from last year, and we got the benefit of 50 million into 2021 for the structural restructuring, Scott. 
Scott Graham: Okay, sorry. 
Bill Burke: But what I’d say is in the second half of the year, you're going to see those temporary costs come back in. And a little bit came in, in the first quarter, a little more in the second quarter. But in the second half of the year, you're going to have -- they're all back in. So that's how we’ve modeled the year and we look at it.
Scott Graham: Thank you for that. And I read your press release, I listened to your prepared remarks and really nary a peep on supply chain. And it's kind of like all the rage this quarter on conference calls and nothing from you guys. So could you maybe give us sort of your view of what you're seeing both internally and externally, things that could maybe not happening in the first quarter but maybe could back up into you -- again, not internally, but something externally that could back up into you? And in fact, does that as a concern plus the add backs of the costs, is that what's keeping the second half guidance in check?
David Zapico: You're right on, Scott. The supply chain -- there are certainly challenges in materials and logistics right now. Specifically, the semiconductor shortages have our attention and our supply chain team are working this issue aggressively. Our guidance reflects all known risks. This is a serious issue, and one that will likely be with us for some period of time. And we're managing this with our dedicated business unit supply chain personnel with an overlay of our company-wide global sourcing, and they're an effective team and we've done an effective job on it so far. But it is a serious issue. Our guidance reflects the known risks and we're confident we can deliver it. But it really -- we just felt it was too early in the year to improve the second half earnings and sales guidance because of that. We think it's a nice balance.
Scott Graham: Makes sense. My last question is a question you've heard me ask before. I know you kind of went through the four big segments on their organic. Could you also throw in your outlooks for those segments?
David Zapico: Yes, sure. In process, we talked about it and it was up mid single digits in the quarter and returned to positive organic growth earlier than we expected. A little extra color there. Ultra Precision Technologies and our Materials Analysis divisions really had good quarters and they're seeing improving demand across a broad set of end markets. They’re in the research, semiconductor and industrial markets.  We're also seeing very strong growth in orders across our process businesses. Organic quarters were up low double digit, so a little bit higher than AMETEK’s overall. And for the full year, we now expect those organic sales for our process businesses to be up high single digits versus the prior year. It was mid single digits in the original guide for the year and we’ve raised it to high single digits. So process orders look good, process is doing very well in Asia. And certain divisions are starting to fire on all cylinders.  In our aerospace and defense business, our overall sales for A&D were down approximately 10% in the first quarter, modestly ahead of our expectation. And really there's a bifurcation going on there. The defense businesses remained robust with sales up low double digits on a percentage basis. Commercial aerospace are still feeling the effects of the pandemics. Year-on-year rates have declined or continuing to improve. But in the first quarter, commercial aerospace sales were down approximately 25%. So for all of '21, like I said before, we continue to expect low to mid single digit organic sales growth from our aerospace and defense business. We did not change the outlook on that segment as we did the other three.  Power and industrial overall sales were up slightly from the prior year's first quarter. Very strong orders, up mid teens on orders. We now expect organic sales for our power and industrial businesses to be up high single digits and we changed that from up mid single digits in the first outlook for the year. And finally, our automation and engineered solutions, up modestly versus the prior year, while organic sales were up mid single digits. Overall, sales were impacted by the divestiture of Reading Alloys in the first quarter of last year. Sales across our automation businesses, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, remained strong and we're seeing solid demand conditions across their international markets, in Asia and China in particular. And for all of 2021, we now expect automation and engineered solution businesses organic sales growth to be up high single digits with stronger growth in our automation businesses than our engineered solutions business. And so you end up with both EIG and EMG being up high single digits raised from mid single digits. Okay, Scott?
Scott Graham: Awesome. Thank you for that summary, Dave.
David Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Qualitatively, do you think there was any pull forward or precautionary orders there in the first quarter? And were those a bit of a tailwind for the 9% organic orders growth you had in the quarter?
David Zapico: Good question. We have highly engineered products. So I don't think people are stocking them. But certainly in the current macro environment, people want to get their orders -- customers want to get their orders placed to make sure that they can get the products that they need. So we're seeing confident customers concerned about the global supply chain, and placing their orders earlier than expected.
David Ridley-Lane: And then the other question I have is on the trends by geography. We've heard Europe has been relatively slower. Interested in where you saw the largest inflection in your organic trends?
David Zapico: All of the geographies showed improvements. The U.S. was down mid single digits, improvements in most areas but the decline was driven by commercial aerospace and oil and gas. Really, it was the same picture in Europe where we were down mid single digits with good improvement, but weaknesses in commercial aero and oil and gas. And Asia was the star for us, a broad-based strength up mid 20s led by our automation business and our process business.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.
David Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is open.
Rob Wertheimer: Hi. Good morning.
David Zapico: Good morning, Rob.
Rob Wertheimer: My question is kind of a follow up on the supply chain question that was asked earlier. Your margin performance was quite good in the quarter on revenues that hadn't come back yet. I'm wondering how big, if any, you can quantify the supply chain drag. And maybe more importantly, do you have a sense as to whether you've reached the kind of maximum disruption point in 1Q and 2Q? Are things getting better or did folks pull out all the stops in 1Q to get stuff done throughout the supply chain that leaves more risk out there, just when can we sort of stop worrying about the issue? Thanks.
David Zapico: In Q1, we did an excellent job and we didn't have any inability to ship because of supply chain. And our teams are going to work on the full year and there are certainly challenges, but we have a good team working on them and going to solve them. I don't think we've seen the worst of it yet, just based on what's happening on semiconductors. I think some of the logistics issues we think will moderate during midyear, but the semiconductor shortages could continue into 2022. And there are higher prices you're dealing with or issues with the global supply chain recovering from a V-shaped recovery, and we have a really good supply chain capability. We're dealing with it effectively, but we're not immune to it. So we're doing our best to stay on top of it. In Q1, we didn't have any issues and our guidance reflects the known issues, and we're confident in our guidance.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you.
David Zapico: Thank you, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Brett Linzey: Hi. Good morning, all.
David Zapico: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Linzey: Hi. My first question is just on the defense business. It continues to grow with these acquisitions. And it's been an area that you've seen very strong growth. I'm just curious what that growth rate looks like over the next two to three years? I know you're on a variety of platforms. And then also just if you could maybe parse out U.S. versus international for defense specifically?
David Zapico: Yes, great questions, Brett. The first thing, defense is about 12% of the sales of AMETEK. And when we looked at Abaco, we wanted to make sure that we have a changing administration, we wanted to make sure we were able to grow through this. And if you look back at Abaco over the last three or four years, they grew about 16% and that's very, very excellent. It's healthy. We feel that embedded computing is among the most compelling growth opportunities in A&D to the substantial DoD focus on modernization and upgrades of existing defense platforms, because there's a focus on processing intensive and data intensive mission capabilities in the future. We also got comfortable with -- they've amassed over $1 billion in design wins that underpin the growth over the next several years. So that's all good. But at the same time, we think they're well positioned to offset any overall DoD funding headwinds, because of those factors. And we’ve modeled our top line as a high single digit grower versus the mid teens in the recent past. So we think we got a conservative model there. The management team of the business is still driving to those higher growth rates. But we modeled it conservatively. And when you look at AMETEK’s broader defense exposure beyond Abaco, right now, we're kind of in the right areas. There's a lot of electronics going in and we're in cooling and heating electronics in terms of the environmental controls, and it's been doing well for us. And we think this year for 2021 outside of Abaco, our core business will be up into high single digits in the defense market. And we went into the year saying mid single digits, but we had a very strong first quarter. So we improved the defense business to mid to high single digits.
Brett Linzey: Great. Thanks for that. And just back to M&A, great to see the velocity of deals pick back up. But given the potential tax changes and the fact that interactions are improving here, is the 1.8 billion of available capital the optimal range, but maybe you'd be comfortable flexing up even above that opportunistically as volumes pick back up and the fact we’re early in the recovery? Just curious on your flex up capacity.
Bill Burke: Yes, sure. If you look at -- if we spent that 1.8 billion that we talked about, certainly there'd be more capacity available. Our leverage would still only be below 2.5 at that point in time. So we'd have additional room to flex up from there if the right deals came along. So from a balance sheet capacity, that's not an issue and it's always, as we say, it's all about making sure that we have the management capability to be able to bring in those deals effectively, and Dave touched on that earlier in his comments. 
David Zapico: Yes. Our strategy is really not capacity constrained. Even at 2.5, we're well below our covenants. Our strategy is constrained by finding good deals that are differentiated that meet our requirements, so we can improve. So we're optimistic that we're going to be able to do that. And hopefully, we're talking to you again later this year. And we have a good pipeline, but it's really finding those deals that we get confident we can get a return. That's the key issue, Brett, not finding them.
Brett Linzey: Yes. Congrats on the quarter and the deal flow.
David Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is open.
Joseph Giordano: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
David Zapico: Hi, Joe. How are you doing?
Joseph Giordano: Good. So we touched on supply chain a couple of times and you guys are doing a good job there. Just curious when you went through your diligence on all these deals, how did you get comfortable that you weren't bringing in potential problems? Like when I think about embedded computing and things like that, how do you get comfortable that the supply chains and the requirements there of the new businesses, or things that you can pop into your existing framework and not stress it too much?
David Zapico: Yes, that's a great question. And we obviously spent a lot of time on that. And based on our questions and Abaco in particular, they have all their -- they have committed order for their plan on 2021. So we pushed it and they responded, and it was an area of heavy focus on our diligence. You don't have full access to the business, but it's understood by the Abaco team, they were very good. And I think that we're well positioned to deal with the supply chain issues in that business. 
Joseph Giordano: And when I think about overall AMETEK now pro forma, not to give you guys more work, but how do we think about the segmentation structure? We got two segments, they're getting pretty large. Are they providing in your opinion like adequate transparency into the total company, or maybe do we have to think about a new structure? 
David Zapico: Yes, we're not thinking about a new structure. We got the four sub-segments under the two reporting segments externally. So we have EIG and EMG. EIG is about two-thirds of the size of the company. EMG is about one-third. And we provide insight in revenue disaggregation into process, which is about 46% of the company pro forma. Aerospace and defense was about 19% of the company pro forma. Power and industrial which is about 14% of the company and automation and engineered solutions is about 22%. And power and industrial is 14%. So we're comfortable with it. And we think this structure is going to let us go and grow for the next few years.
Joseph Giordano: Thanks, guys.
David Zapico: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Kevin for closing remarks.

David A. Zapico: Thank you Kevin and good morning, everyone. AMETEK concluded 2020 with a strong fourth quarter, delivering record operating results despite ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic. Our businesses saw solid sequential sales and order improvements in the quarter, while year-over-year growth turned positive across several of our businesses. We also drove exceptional operating performance in the quarter, leveraging our broad set of operational excellence initiatives. These efforts led to record backlog, margins, and cash flow as well as a high quality of earnings that exceeded our expectations, positioning us extremely well as we look ahead to 2021.  The safety of our employees remains our number one priority. We continue to adjust our practices and enforce our safety protocols across our businesses to help limit the possible spread of the virus. While we are cautious in the short-term, given COVID-19 and ongoing travel restrictions, we are highly confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to deliver exceptional growth and shareholder returns over the long-term. The AMETEK growth model continues to provide the framework for long-term sustainable success, and our performance in 2020 was a testament to the strength and flexibility of the model.  Now, let me return to our results for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion, down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Organic sales were also down 8% with a divestiture of Reading Alloys of 3 point [ph], the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing one point to growth, and foreign currency added two points. As we saw in prior quarters, our commercial aerospace business was the most impacted by the pandemic with sales down approximately 35% in the quarter. Order is continuing to improve with our book to bill at 1.07 for the fourth quarter. This led to a record backlog of $1.8 billion, providing us with a positive line of sight into 2021.  Operating income in the fourth quarter was $298.1 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margins were a record 24.9%, up an impressive 210 basis points compared to the prior year period. EBITDA in the fourth quarter was a record $360.7 million and EBITDA margins were also a record of 30.1%, up a robust 300 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2019. This operating performance led to earnings per diluted share of $1.08 matching last year’s fourth quarter results and comfortably ahead of our guidance for the quarter. Our business has also delivered outstanding cash flow during the quarter, with operating cash flow up 13% to a record $386 million and free cash flow conversion exceptional 158% of net income. Now, let me provide additional detail of the operating group level for the fourth quarter. The Electronic Instruments Group delivers superb operating performance despite challenging market conditions. EIG sales in the fourth quarter were $819.4 million, down 7% from the prior year and in line with our expectations of solid sequential improvement. Organic sales were down 10% while the acquisition of IntelliPower contributing 2% and foreign currency contributing 1%. Commercial aerospace remained the largest driver of the sales weakness, our other EIG businesses saw improvements versus prior quarters. Our materials analysis division returned to growth in the fourth quarter while other EIG businesses, including Zygo and Telular are also again getting year-over-year growth. Despite the overall sales decline, EIG’s operating income in the fourth quarter increased 3% over the prior year to a record $236 million and operating margin has reached a new high of 28.8% expanding an exceptional 270 basis points over the same period in 2019.  Our Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating results in the quarter. EMG sales were $379.5 million down 11% from the fourth quarter in 2019, driven in large part by the divestiture of Reading Alloys. Organic sales were down 4% with a divestiture and eight point headwind and foreign currency adding two points. In addition to continued strong growth across our defense businesses, we were pleased to see our automation business generate solid organic growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter operating income for EMG was $79.8 million and operating margin expanded an impressive 110 basis points to 21%.  Now for the full year results. Despite very difficult end market conditions and meaningful top-line headwinds in 2020 AMETEK was able to expand full year operating margins while delivering record levels of operating and free cash flow, truly outstanding performance. Overall sales for the year were $4.5 billion down 12% from 2019. Organic sales declined 13% with acquisitions adding 4%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a 3% headwind, and foreign currency flat for the year. Operating income in 2020 was a $1.1 billion and operating margins were a record 23.6% expanding 80 basis points over 2019. EBITDA for the year was $1.32 billion and EBITDA margins were a record 29.2% up 230 basis points from last year. This led to full year earnings of $3.95 per diluted share down 6% versus the prior year. As bill will highlight our businesses did a fantastic job managing our working capital, which helped drive a record level of cash flow while full year operating cash flow up 15% to $1.28 billion.  In summary, while 2020 was very challenging, I'm extremely proud of the way AMETEK colleagues managed through the pandemic and delivered tremendous results. Before I cover the outlook for 2021, I wanted to highlight certain key elements of the AMETEK growth model and how each position us for long-term success. First and foremost, AMETEK’s proven operational acumens stood out in 2020 with our businesses doing an incredible job, driving our operational excellence initiatives. In the fourth quarter, we generated 60 million in total cost savings with 50 million in structural savings and 10 million in temporary savings. And for the full year total incremental savings versus the prior year were $235 million with approximately $145 million of structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings, including furloughs, travel reductions, and temporary pay actions. As we look ahead to 2021, we expect a much more modest level of temporary savings versus 2020 as the economy continues to recover from the worst of the pandemic and we continue to add back these temporary costs. However, we do expect to drive meaningful, incremental structural savings across our various operational excellence initiatives, including across our global sourcing activities. For the full year 2021, we expect approximately $140 million of incremental operational excellence savings.  Shifting to new product development. Even through this downturn we remain committed to investing in new products and solutions that help our customers solve their most complex challenges. In 2020, we invested $246 million in research, development, and engineering, approximately 5.5% of sales. These investments led to outstanding innovation and dozens of new product launches. In the fourth quarter our Vitality Index or the percent of sales generated from products introduced over the last three years was an impressive 25%. In 2021, we expect to invest approximately $270 million or 5.5% of sales in research development and engineering to enhance our position as a global technology leader. This is a 10% increase over 2020 RD&E [ph] spend. Finally, I want to touch on our acquisition strategy. Prior to the onset of the pandemic last year, we acquired IntelliPower, a leading provider of high reliability, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems for mission critical defense and industrial applications. IntelliPower has integrated nicely into our power systems and instruments division and is performing well. While deal flow in 2020 was impacted by the pandemic, we were seeing continued improvements in the M&A markets and are managing a strong pipeline of acquisition targets across a broad set of markets. As Bill will discuss shortly, AMETEK has significant balance sheet capacity and when combined with our robust cash flow generation provides us with meaningful capital to support our acquisition strategy, which remains our number one priority for capital deployment. Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. While we remain cautious in the short-term, given the uncertainty and the timing and pace of the recovery, we're confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. We continue to manage our businesses safely and prudently while ensuring continued investments in key growth initiatives. For the year we expect both overall and organic sales to be up mid-single-digits versus 2020. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $4.18 to $4.30 up 6% to 9% compared to 2020. For the first quarter, we anticipate continued year-over-year impact from the pandemic with overall sales down low to mid-single-digits and first quarter earnings of $0.97 to a $1.02 per share, flat to down 5% versus the prior year.  In summary, the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the asset-light nature of our businesses, our leading positions in attractive niche markets, and our world-class workforce will continue to drive long-term sustainable success. I'm confident that we are emerging from this unprecedented economic environment even stronger than we were before. Again, I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and tremendous efforts as we manage the ongoing global crisis. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill. 
William J. Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an outstanding finish to 2020 with record operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter. I would also like to thank and recognize all of my AMETEK colleagues for their significant contributions in 2020. The way our teams persevered to the challenges of the past year was truly impressive. With that I will provide additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year, but we'll also provide some additional guidance for 2021.  Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $17.7 million up modestly from the prior year. For the full year G&A was down 11% from 2019 due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary cost reductions. And as a percentage of total sales was 1.5% in both years. For 2021 general and administrative expenses were expected to be up approximately 10% due primarily to the return of temporary costs, including compensation. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.1% up from 17.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The difference in tax rate was due primarily to the finalization of tax returns in each of the years. For 2021, assuming the current tax regime, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.  Our businesses continued to manage their working capital exceptionally well. Operating working capital was an impressive 14% in the fourth quarter, down 330 basis points from the 17.3% reported in the same quarter last year, reflecting the outstanding work by our teams. Capital expenditures were $37 million in the fourth quarter and $74 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2021 are expected to be approximately $110 million. Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $65 million and for the full year was $255 million. In 2021 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $260 million, including after-tax acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.50 per diluted share.  As Dave highlighted our businesses continue to generate tremendous levels of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $386 million up 13% over last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow was also a record $349 million up 16% over the same period last year, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 158% of net income. Cash flow for the full year also set new record levels. Operating cash flow for 2020 was $1.28 billion up 15% over the prior year and free cash flow was $1.21 billion, a year-over-year increase of 19%. Full year free cash flow conversion was 158% of net income adjusted for the Redding Alloys gain.  Total debt at December 31st was $2.41 billion down from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 billion. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times and our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.9 times at year-end. We enter 2021 with approximately $2.6 billion in liquidity to support our growth initiatives. This liquidity, along with our strong balance sheet and no material debt maturities until 2024 enables us to manage the continued effects of the economic downturn, will also deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions.  To conclude our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2021 and beyond remains positive, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model, and our world-class workforce. Kevin. 
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew, we're now ready to take questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. 
Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi guys, good morning. 
David A. Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Just obviously ending the piece on the 2.6 billion of liquidity, as you think of that M&A pipeline today, 2020 and even the beginning of 2021 there has been a lot of noted challenges. Has that caused you to alter sort of what's attractive in your mind and towards the AMETEK portfolio?
William J. Burke: That's a great question, Allison, and not really. I mean, M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we feel there's going to be substantial opportunity for us. We -- as you mentioned with the liquidity and our cash flow, we have a very strong balance sheet and we're really positioned to use that as a lever to increase our earnings. And we're seeing an uptick in pipeline opportunities. You started to see some of the pent up demand happen in Q4, the market is very hot, we're maintaining our discipline, but we're working on deals of all sizes. We have some larger deals we're working on and we have some AMETEK typical size of the ozone. We even have a couple of small technology acquisitions we're looking at. So, I would say we've never been busier on M&A and we're looking at it the same way. We think deploying our capital on M&A is the best way to get our shareholders return.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Now within that, are there any verticals that have, I guess, increased in importance in your view just given what's happened?
William J. Burke: Yeah, I think, we have a 42 business units and they all develop an acquisition plan and we're looking at all of those. And, we're certainly seeing properties come available in all areas. We're also looking at some places where we can get a high return on capital. So I'd say that, our bias is toward more technology deals, but not necessarily a vertical market. We're looking at all of them right now. 
Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Agree. And then just last, on that temporary cost savings, I know Bill you talked about G&A being up 10%. Should we layer that in more so in the back half, how should we think of that cadence of that coming back?
William J. Burke: I'd say primarily that the temporary costs with some small exceptions in the first quarter as we continue to see the effects of the pandemic. They're going to be coming back basically I'd say evenly across the year, a little bit lower in the first quarter.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thank you. 
Kevin Coleman: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. 
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. 
David A. Zapico: Good morning Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, nice, strong finish to the year. And would like to hear what the approach was this time to providing guidance, I mean, there's still so much COVID uncertainty in the macro so what was different this time as you frame guidance and maybe give us some insight into how the cadence of the monthly sequential improvement that you saw this year? 
David A. Zapico: Sure. And thank you for your comments on the quarter. We sat back and -- near the end of the year and into January, there was situations that occur where you're having to close down your plants for a couple of days, get everyone tested, clean it and people were bringing the virus to work, I'll say. And it created a difficult operating environment. And certainly it made us think through giving guidance for the quarter and for the year. But as we thought through it, and we were executing well, so well that we got confident that we're able to operate and execute with the virus and we have good processes and protocols in place. And we're seeing the -- we're mid cycle and long cycle businesses and we're seeing those demand pick up later in the year we are assuming and that all went into a discussion. We talked about it several times, but we feel comfortable with the guidance that we're giving and we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to execute and we feel the processes and procedures we've developed are allowing us to operate safely. And we also feel we're feeling an uptick and we're looking for the short cycle businesses and markets and seeing them trend up and we're assuming that's going to happen for us a couple of quarters later.
Deane Dray: That's helpful. And if we're looking at first quarter guide, and is there any of the usual seasonality in effect. I mean, just with COVID it's uncertain how much is a reaction to coming back the recovery, but is there any of the usual seasonality in effect?
David A. Zapico: Yeah. What happens to us usually in Q1 is that our processed businesses are stronger in Q4 and not as strong in Q1, that's the seasonality. So you have a drop in revenue there. And then on the bottom line in Q1, along with the contribution margin effect of that, you have a lack of Reading and you also have us resetting some compensation G&A type costs. So, you add that all together and our top line guide for Q1 is down low to mid-single-digits. And we gave the earnings range of $0.97 to $1.02. So, that's the way that we got that. And you also asked about the cadence and I didn't answer that in the first part of your question. The cadence throughout the quarter was a pretty typical trend for us. Orders grew sequentially every month with December being the strongest month of the year and in fact strongest month of the quarter -- of 2020. And in terms of sales, we had a similar pattern with growing sequentially. December was strong and also the strongest month of the year. So that was good. And then January, orders in sales, they ended up at a level of support over Q1 in our full year guide and I would characterize them as solid. So continuing the positive trend, when you think about the low to mid-single-digit guide, back in Q2, we had organic growth of about minus 22% and that improved in Q3 where it was minus 14%. And then you see the last quarter Q4 completed was minus 8%. So to go from that minus 8% organic to minus low to mid-single-digit organic, you see a continuing improvement. So we have calendarization seasonality issue, but underlying it is a continuing sequential improvement of the business.
Deane Dray: Yeah, that really sounds and looks like a V-shape recovery to us. I know there is a lot of hard work in getting that done, I appreciate it. And you also answered my question about January, so I'm all set. Thank you very much.
David A. Zapico: Thank you Deane.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. 
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning guys.
David A. Zapico: Hey, Josh.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Dave, just on the incremental margin expectation. I know there's a lot of moving pieces, some of what you touched on and probably chief amongst those is maybe to start the year, organic growth no need to get out ahead of yourself on expectations, but as the year progresses or as growth starts to accelerate, what should we think of is kind of the underlying incremental margin for AMETEK right now, I know that with small numbers on the growth, it kind of gets distorted by other items, but what the real number is as we move forward? 
David A. Zapico: Yeah, I think that's a great question. And you will recall that we talked about it last quarter, we had about 90 million of temporary costs that we're going to have to fit back in and to the budget model this year. And what it turns out is that we got really strong OPEX cost reductions of 140 million. On top of that we have continued stronger pricing and when you take the organic growth combined with the OPEX structural savings combined with the pricing, we're able to absorb the temporary costs coming back to the P&L and end up with an incremental margin of about 35%. Now, typically AMETEK would have a bit higher incremental margin, but the 35% is a solid number and it includes absorbing all the temporary costs. So we feel comfortable with the margin forecast that we have for 2021. We think core operating margins will be up about 40 basis points. And we believe the incremental margins will be up about 35%. 
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. And then just on the end markets themselves, obviously a pretty heady cocktail of businesses inside the portfolio. Just given that this has been such an atypical downturn and recovery, anything that you would call out as maybe being ahead of normal kind of recovery trajectory or behind for that matter relative to some of these early mid and late cycle markets that you guys participate in? 
David A. Zapico: Not really. I think the military market has been very strong for us. We've talked about that. We think that'll continue into 2021. We are seeing a tick up in the semiconductor market, that's not atypical. A lot of people are seeing that, but we have some technology that's a more tied to the EUV, which is the next technology in semiconductor. So we're seeing some research demands in that area. That business looks solid for us. And in general, everything is behaving as we would think it would and we do have the mid and long cycle businesses and the aerospace business we're not assuming it's going to -- the commercial aerospace business we're not assuming a recovery during, it's flat up a bit, flat low single for 2021. Most of the other markets are up mid-single-digit. 
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Yeah, that's great detail. Thanks Dave. 
David A. Zapico: Sure. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: Good morning. Wanted to sort of pick up on the FY 2021 sort of [Technical Difficulty] anything by geography that you've called out next year in your plant process, I'd be particularly interested in what your views are on the U.S. and China markets?
David A. Zapico: Yeah, good question. Yeah, I'll start with Q4. In Q4 there were really mixed trends across geographies and with Asia returning to strong growth and Europe and U.S. seeing continued sequential improvement, but still showing negative organic growth. And we talk about Asia first, we had a great quarter in Asia. We were up low double-digits, and we had strong growth in both our process and automation businesses. And China in particular grew 22% with us in the quarter. So a really big pickup there in the process and automation. And if we talk about prior quarters, automation picking up, the process business followed, and that had a big impact on EIG margins as you can see in the accounts. When you think about the U.S. we were down low double-digits on broad based weakness, other than the defense market. Defense market was strong and we think about Europe, we were down mid-teens on broad based weakness, other than the automation business. So, in the U.S. and in Europe it was down except for small parts of our portfolio that were bright spots, but in China we really knocked it out of the park. In Asia we did well. What we're thinking, the incremental improvements in 2021 are going to continue in Europe and the U.S. so the sequential improvements that we've been seeing are going to continue. And, we think that Asia or quotation activity Asia is going to maintain strength. So I'm not sure if we're going to go up 22% in China, every quarter, but certainly we're seeing strength in the pipeline in China and [indiscernible].
Nigel Coe: Great, thank you. And, regards to the M&A pipeline, you talked about variety of different sizes in there, how big multiples and multiples right now what was seen in the public multiples is obviously very high, how confident are you, you can still do deals, ROI to make sense to you?
David A. Zapico: Yeah, we've been able to do it so far, and we have a very strong pipeline and so I'm pretty confident that we're going to be able to keep doing that. I mean, that's a -- there's a lot of yields. The thing that's happened is we're able to drive more synergy than we were a few years or five or 10 years ago. We have a great synergy capability to improve businesses and we're disciplined, returns matter to us, and I'm confident that we're going to be able to deploy the cash on M&A.
Nigel Coe: Right, thanks again. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. 
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning everybody. 
David A. Zapico: Good morning Brett. 
Brett Linzey: Hey, I wanted to come back to the structural cost programs. Obviously, you guys have done quite a bit over the last couple of years to, navigate the pandemic, but also integrate acquired businesses. As we think about the programs in 2021, do those continue on a structural basis or do you think you've got the businesses where they need to be from a cost structure standpoint? 
David A. Zapico: I think there's still structural programs that we're going to execute in 2021. And it's ongoing because we're combining businesses and we're implementing acquisition synergies. And we've got that 140 million in structural costs and there's 80 million of structural savings, there's 80 million of OPEX savings in that. So remember we have a spillover from 2020, but there's ongoing program. So the way I look at it is we have over 150 operating facilities and we have a strategic plan on OPEX, and we take the advantages to combine and make things more efficient all the time and 2021 will be no different.
Brett Linzey: Got it, that's great. And just on back to the price cost question, what are you embedding for price via gross price realization for 2021 and how are you thinking about freight, steel, other raw mat inflationary pressures against that? And then any items in terms of supply chain that are a worry point that we should be thinking about or constraining your ability to serve customers? 
David A. Zapico: Good question. So, for all of the 2020 we had about 1.5 points of price and total inflation was about 1 point. So at a 50 basis point spread for all of the year but actually in Q4 of 2020, our pricing ticked up a bit. So it was a little higher than 1.5%. So that added to margins and for 2021, we see slightly higher pricing than 1.5%, but we're going to have slightly higher inflation. So you think about it as a 50 basis point spread, a little higher price, a little higher inflation, and we are seeing commodity price inflation. We are seeing transportation costs, but we got them under control. We have very good supply chain people and we've got that factored in and with our highly differentiated portfolio and our leadership position in these niche markets, we have those kind of costs we're typically able to pass them on to the customer. And I've been very pleased to see our pricing out of -- to the pandemic. Now in terms of material shortages I mean, there's a little bit of a -- there are issues in the semiconductor market that had been in the press where you see the automotive industry having some issues now and our supply chain people are on top of that and working it. But it hasn’t cost us any missed [indiscernible] or anything like that. So, it is just something to manage and an issue we are working on. 
Brett Linzey: And just one more on prices, is it fair say with the exit of Reading that your volatility on price up and down has dampened somewhat as part of the total portfolio, is that fair?
David A. Zapico: That’s exactly right Brett. You are right on. 
Brett Linzey: Got it, okay. Great, I will pass along. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. 
Christopher Glynn: Hey, thank you. Good morning everybody. 
David A. Zapico: Good morning Chris. 
Christopher Glynn: Nice numbers, I think the balance sheet might look the most ample I have ever seen. So, in my understanding haven’t covered you a long time, usually guide kind of base case revenue with some hedge in the implied margin outlook and you went through that with Josh’s question. In this case you are entering 2021 with record backlog and minus 13% organic comp for the full year. I think it sort of suggests mid-single-digit pretty in the bag barring significant macro disruptions. Just want to reconcile the organic comp with the backlog numbers if you could. 
William J. Burke: Yeah, the backlog number is customer is feeling confident and placing orders for the year. It is not just one quarter, the customers are getting their orders in for the first couple of quarters of the year and I think that AMETEK you have covered a long time, we are mid and long cycle businesses so we typically see the uptick couple of quarters later. Our automation business is seeing it now but the long cycle businesses in aero and oil and gas are not seeing an uptick. So the fact that we have a negative organic growth in Q1 and there is four numbers for the year, when you have one number that is negative and you add them up, you are at mid-single-digits. 
Christopher Glynn: Got it, thanks for that. 
David A. Zapico: Okay. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt. 
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning. Great job on the cost side as usual and supply chain. I wanted to ask maybe a little bit more on the cost add backs. Dave is the plan to add back the entire 90 that you took out and if so how does that go into the segments?
David A. Zapico: Yeah, I don’t think we will add back the entire 90 but I will give you an example. We left the temporary cost savings in Q4 were $10 million. So we really ramped on by that point. In Q1 it is significantly lower than that. So, it is -- and we will adjust that as we go through the year but I think that temporary costs are going to become so small as we go throughout the year they are not meaningful anymore. So it is really the structural savings that drive the margin improvement. 
Scott Graham: Got is and then maybe Bill one for you, the working capital numbers were like pretty incredible. I was just wondering it’s going to have to go the other way this year, what would you think the working capital percentage increases by in 2021?
William J. Burke: Well, as you think about it yeah, our businesses did a fantastic job on working capital, taken inventories down, receivables performance was the best I have seen in my 30 years with the company, 30 years plus. So it was fantastic. Will that continue, well I don’t know. We are going to work real hard to make sure it does and our businesses are focused on that. So will there be some give back next year, I expect it to be a little bit but we are very much focused on trying to keep that at the levels we have seen in this fourth quarter and the full year.
David A. Zapico: And the key point for us Scott is, I think we had 158% free cash flow to net income conversion in 2020. And for 2021 we're targeting 110%. So above a 100% even this environment, certainly we're going to have to put some cash back on the balance sheet, but we're operating very efficiently and, we're going to put it back on the balance sheet grudgingly. 
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you. Would you mind if I squeeze in one more? 
David A. Zapico: Yeah, sure. 
Scott Graham: Sure. So, in terms of the liquidity number, I mean, Christopher's comment was like, I haven't seen this level of liquidity in your balance sheet in my time. Is there room in there for some share buybacks if the first half of the year is maybe a little bit slower on M&A than you're hoping because I know how disciplined you are there, is there room for share buybacks in that? 
William J. Burke: Clearly our number one priority is M&A. And I really think we're going to be able to deploy the capital on M&A but, if we can't, we'll find a way to get the cash back to you, either through buybacks or dividends. We have a consistently increasing dividend and we've been opportunistic on share buybacks. But I'm not feeling that way right now. I think there's an incredible acquisition opportunity for us and for physicians at a level and to your point, a liquidity position that we haven't been at before. So it's very exciting to me, and I'm very excited about the pipeline. 
Scott Graham: Great, thank you. 
David A. Zapico: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.
Richard Eastman: Yes, good morning. 
David A. Zapico: Hey Rick, we don't hear you. So Andrew, why don't we go to the next question. 
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Hi guys, good morning. 
David A. Zapico: Good morning, Andrew. 
Andrew Obin: Hey, congratulations on another great quarter. 
David A. Zapico: Thank you. 
Andrew Obin: Just a question for you on orders, we sort of tried to back into the number from your book to bill, as it were sort of calculated something like down around 8%. I was wondering if we could talk about the auto rates and just maybe give us color by market, I mean, I think it's sort of highlighted, China [ph] highlighted aerospace, but maybe a little bit more color there? 
William J. Burke: Yeah, I'll give you the numbers. Our overall orders were down 8%. But organic we're down 2%. And EIG organic we're down 2% and EMG organic we're down 1%. So what you backed into with the overall orders was correct and we had a good organic month at minus two. 
Andrew Obin: Got you, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Can you just talk about how you guys are thinking about your own CAPEX spending into 2021 and how you have changed in any way, shape or form, how you think about where you will spend CAPEX on, what you spend CAPEX on into aftermath of the pandemic? 
William J. Burke: Yeah, CAPEX is -- we plan on 110 million this year. And opportunities -- we have opportunities that are going to provide excellent returns. For growth CAPEX, efficiency improvements, expanding our footprint in emerging markets, and if you recall in 2020 we talked about at mid-year, we had some expansion projects in emerging markets, and we couldn't get people there. We needed to get some expertise from different regions to the emerging markets, we couldn't travel. So we delayed them. So we spent 74 million in 2020 and our original plan was 102 million. So we ended up spending a little less than 2% in 2020 and 2021 we're going to spend a little over 2%. We're going to make up a bit of those projects, because they're still there. And there's great opportunity in other areas. But we're still longer term 2% of sales is the CAPEX number. And we have a little bit of makeup this year with projects that -- these efficiency projects and growth projects have very high internal rates of returns or rates of returns like 30%, 40%, 50%. So this is the kind of stuff that you want to fund. You want to get done. And we have a whole slew of projects that we're getting after. 
Andrew Obin: And just are you spending anything different on what kind of equipment you're buying, are you spending more on software, are you changing your suppliers? 
William J. Burke: Yeah, I think there's a mix of all that in there and it's bottoms up from the businesses. But yeah, I think definitely software or digital strategy is driving a lot of that. I think the emerging market infrastructure that we're putting in place is driving that. So you are right on in the areas and we just have a particularly large group of projects, and we're going to get those done this year and we got great returns on them. 
Andrew Obin: Fantastic, great to hear. Thank you very much. 
David A. Zapico: Thank you Andrew. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. 
Andrew Buscaglia: Good morning guys. I wanted to talk a little bit more about M&A because I am curious your philosophy is out of this -- out of the pandemic, do you -- out of the other capacity due to some larger size deals. First off, do you see more medium large sized deals as likely? And then secondly, is there sort of philosophy here that to buy stuff that's kind of beaten down, beaten up that you could -- you're buying at a low here, are you going to go after certain assets that whatever is opportunistic at the time, wherever there's a good deal to be had? 
David A. Zapico: Right, I think it's both. It's all of the above. And when I think about the -- we expanded our revenue targets, the acquisition we're looking at so you can see deals in that $200 million to $300 million to $400 million range. Those are considered big. So we're not talking about the acquisitions that would be the size of AMETEK or even half the size of AMETEK. We think those bigger deals, it's much harder to create value. So there's smaller deals, but the size growing with the size of the company, we're a bigger company now. So, like I said, there's technology deals we're looking at that augment our organic growth, there's deals in our sweet, sweet spot, very close to our existing positions that will get a very high return on capital one. And there's some bigger deals that fit with us, but are in adjacent markets. And there's multiple deals in each one of those categories. So we are busy, we're prudent and approach. But I'm optimistic that we're going to be able to deploy our capital and add very strong businesses effective. 
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. And can you remind us what was medical as a percentage of sales this year in 2020? And then can you just minus, like what is that, you know, what that area I think it's pretty interesting as a budding platform for you guys, what are you thinking about that going forward? 
David A. Zapico: Yeah, medical sales 2021, 2020 are in the range of 15% of sales. So that's approximately $700 million. And, we have businesses that are doing very well in that area and their niche positions like all of AMETEK and there's expansion opportunities there. So we're actively looking at healthcare medical space and we'd like to see that be a bigger percentage of the company. 
Andrew Buscaglia: Thank you guys. 
David A. Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano with Cowen.
Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, good morning. This is Francesco on for Joe. 
David A. Zapico: Hello Francesco, good morning. 
Unidentified Analyst : Hey, can you guys talk a little bit about your expectations on aerospace, do you think this in coming to be bottoming out soon and what are the mix implications going forward? 
David A. Zapico: Yeah, it's a great question. And the first point is our aerospace business is one of our more profitable businesses. It is definitely greater than the company average. That was before the pandemic and right now. And the team has done an excellent job of realigning the cost structure, lower volume, but still very profitable and more profitable than the average AMETEK business. So we think any change in volume is going to result in high contribution margins because we have so bring down the cost structure. The second point is there's a distinctly different demand pattern that we've been talking about all along. About half of our business in aerospace and defense is in the military space. That business was up mid-teens in the fourth quarter. We think we still see growth in 2021, but it'll be more mid-single-digits. And in the commercial space, that business was down about 35% in the fourth quarter, down about 30% for the entire full year. And for 2021 the commercial aerospace business we're saying is flat up low single-digits. And the commercial aerospace business is impacted by many variables impacting demand, including government support, airline capacity decisions, and overriding all the competence of the flying public and it's very difficult to predict that thing and to predict those things when the pandemic is raging. So we're pretty conservative about how we are looking at that. The management team we have in aerospace is outstanding. And eventually the commercial business is going to come back. I don't think it's going to be 2021. I think it's going to be beyond that and our guidance reflects that. So we're really -- we have really done the hard work and done the right thing in our aerospace business. So we're poised even for small incremental sales growth to deliver good margins and eventually, that long cycle business will pick up and drive the earnings of the company. 
Unidentified Analyst : Great, that's extremely helpful. Thank you very much. 
David A. Zapico: Okay. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. 
Richard Eastman: Alright, thank you. Try this… 
David A. Zapico: Try one more time. 
Richard Eastman: Yeah, not sure what happened there. Hey, just a quick thought, Dave, when we talk… 
David A. Zapico: Rick, I think we lost you again. Alright, we got you now.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Hey, just when we try to reconcile our segment growth to the AMETEK core growth outlook for 2021. So we're kind of 3% to 5%. And my question is, is EIG I presume EMG, with process coming back stronger, does EMG on the high end of maybe a 3% to 5% core 2021 growth rate? 
David A. Zapico: Yeah, we gave a mid-single-digit range. So for me that says between 4% and 6%, not 3% to 5%. But in that 4% to 6% range, both of the businesses are going to be in that range. And certainly EMG is going to probably start out a little better in the year, but we think the -- when we end the year, they're both going to be plus mid-single-digit growth. 
Richard Eastman: Dave, when I kind of run that math through the numbers here, I look at both segments of the business perhaps being at a revenue rate at the end of 2021 that's below 19 and I guess my thought is there that the longer cycle, mean aerospace would be below and then would oil and gas still be projected to be below 2019 level, are there any other? 
David A. Zapico: Yeah, oil and gas is projected to be lower, and oil and gas is going to have -- the way it looks for us a strong 2022 right now. But, if you if you think about where we're at right now in the fourth quarter, the businesses that showed positive organic growth for our defense business in process, some of our research businesses like our materials analysis division, that division was all positive, organic. Our UPG business Zygo was positive organic. The Telular business was positive organic, and our automation business was positive organic. So as we go out through the year, that'll change. But yeah, the fact of the matter is with our mid and long cycle exposure, while the strong second half and for some of our markets, we will not get back to 2019 in 2021. 
Richard Eastman: Yes, fair enough. And when you talk defense, Dave, is that…
David A. Zapico: Rick, I think we lost you and your question there. 
Kevin Coleman: Andrew, why don’t we wrap it up. 
David A. Zapico: Rick, we hear you now I think. 
Richard Eastman: I don't understand it. Okay, but with defense Dave, when you speak to defense, that's all aerospace defense, is there anything else that you're capturing in that? 
David A. Zapico: No, it is aerospace defense but we do have some land based programs within aerospace, but it's all -- business, that's right. 
Richard Eastman: Okay. Thanks again. Thanks for tolerating the problems. Thank you. 
David A. Zapico: No problem. 
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Coleman for any closing remarks. 
Kevin Coleman: Great, thank you, Andrew. And thanks everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast may be accessed in the investor section of ametek.com. Thanks and have a great day.

We will begin today’s call with prepared remarks from Dave and Bill, and then open it up for questions. I will now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered a strong third quarter, despite ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. While sales continue to be impacted by the pandemic, the demand environment shows solid improvements from the second quarter, as customers return to work and travel restrictions began to slowly ease. In addition, our businesses delivered outstanding operating performance, allowing us to expand margins, generate excellent cash flow and drive earnings ahead of our expectations. I would like to thank our employees who are managing exceptionally well through this pandemic, overcoming both personal and professional challenges to provide essential products and services to our customers. I continue to be impressed by the strength of our workforce and the dedication to our mission of solving our customer’s most complex challenges We remain vigilant and focused on our employees’ safety. Our site and country level pandemic coordinators are doing an excellent job adapting to the shifting guidelines provided by the CDC, and local health and safety agencies. The flexibility our teams have shown in implementing new processes and protocols to ensure a safe working environment has been excellent. Now let me turn to our results for the quarter. Third quarter sales were $1.13 billion, down 12% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Organic sales were down 14%. With the recent acquisitions contributing 5 points to growth, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a 3-point headwind and foreign currency adding 1 point. As expected, our commercial aerospace business, which is less than 10% of the overall company, experienced the largest impact from COVID, with sales down approximately 35% versus the prior year. Our businesses continue to drive operational excellence initiatives to help mitigate demand weakness. These efforts lead to excellent operating results in the quarter. Third quarter operating income was $270 million and operating margins were a record 24%, up 40 basis points compared to last year’s third quarter, while decremental margins were an impressive 20% in the quarter. EBITDA in the third quarter was $332 million and EBITDA margins were a record 29.5%, up 210 basis points over last year’s comparable period. This led to earnings per diluted share of $1.01, down just 5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Furthermore, our businesses generated a strong level of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million and free cash flow conversion was an impressive 146% of that income. Next, let me provide additional details at the operating group level. Our Electronic Instruments Group performed very well in the quarter, despite end-market weakness, delivering outstanding operating performance resulting in strong margin expansion. Sales in the third quarter for EIG were $748.4 million, down 8% from the comparable period in 2019. As expected, we saw solid and wide-spread sequential sales improvements from the second quarter. Organic sales were down 15% year-over-year, with the acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing 6 points and foreign currency contributing 1 point. Commercial aerospace remains a largest driver of organic sales weakness in EIG. EIG’s third quarter operating income was $203.7 million and operating margins were an impressive 27.2%, up 30 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Our Electromechanical Group also saw sequential sales improvement and mitigated a weak demand environment with solid operating performance. EMG sales were $378.6 million, down 18% from last year’s third quarter, driven in part by the impact of the Reading Alloys divestiture. Organic sales were down 13%, with a divestiture of 8-point headwind, the acquisition of PDT added 2 points and foreign currency adding 1 point. EMG’s operating income was $84.3 million and operating margins were solid at 22.3% for the quarter. Let me comment briefly on end-market dynamics for some of our businesses. Overall, we saw solid sequential sales improvements across all markets in the third quarter. We expect continued sequential improvements in the fourth quarter for all businesses other than customer aerospace, where we expect largely flat conditions sequentially. Our strongest market remains defense, where we continue to be well-positioned with content across a wide range of important defense platforms. We are also very well-positioned with our medical and healthcare businesses. Although, they experienced a delay in the return of electro procedures during the third quarter, which offsets solid COVID-driven demand. And our most challenging market remains commercial aerospace remain cautious of a trajectory of a recovery given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Given the uncertain and challenging end-market dynamics, our businesses remain highly focused on driving operational excellence initiatives, both structural and temporary, to manage topline weakness, while ensuring we maintain our investments and key growth initiatives across the company. AMETEK’s asset-light operating model provides us with the flexibility to do both. Our ability to expand margins and generate strong levels of cash flow during this pandemic is evidence of the strength of our operating model. In the third quarter, we generated $70 million in total cost savings, which was at the high end of our expectations, with $40 million in structural savings and $30 million in temporary cost reduction savings. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a slightly higher level of structural savings, while temporary savings will be reduced from the third quarter levels, as we add back additional temporary costs during the quarter. As a result, we expect approximately $55 million in our total cost savings in the fourth quarter, with $45 million in structural and $10 million in temporary cost savings. And for the full year, we expect approximately $230 million in total cost savings, with $140 million in structural savings and $90 million in temporary savings. Our businesses continue to implement new and innovative ways to reach our customers around the world in new markets. Through virtual meeting platforms, augmented reality product demonstrations and service, and enhanced digital marketing initiatives, our businesses have adapted quickly to the new landscape. Seeing our businesses adopt these new ways of doing business quickly and effectively has been very impressive. Our businesses are also collaborating across platforms. As an example, AMETEK Land and AMETEK Rauland recently partnered together to help support Rauland’s reopen schools safely campaign for their Telecenter U solution. Rauland is the leading provider of critical communications, workflow and safety solutions for hospitals and schools. Their Telecenter U solution connects classrooms and educational facilities to district offices for emergencies, event management and everyday communications. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, AMETEK Land, a leading manufacturer of non-contact temperature measurement solutions, recently developed their new VIRALERT 3 system for rapid detection of elevated skin temperatures at points of entry to various facilities, including schools. Through this collaborative effort, Rauland was able to incorporate Land’s VIRALERT 3 technology into their Telecenter U solution to help their customers safely reopen their schools by allowing for temperature screening of students and faculty. In return, AMETEK Land will reach thousands of new potential customers through Rauland’s well-established network of school districts. The result was a valuable solution for our customers. Congratulations to the AMETEK and the AMETEK Rauland team for the success on this project. We are also finding ways to support our customers through new product innovation. Throughout the pandemic, we continue to invest meaningfully in our research and development initiatives, and we are seeing great success from these efforts. Our Vitality Index, which measures the amount of sales generated from new products introduced during the last three years was very strong at 25% in the quarter. During the quarter, Creaform, a worldwide leader in 3D measurement solutions, unveiled its R-Series 3D scanning solution that is designed for automated dimensional quality control applications. The suite of R-Series solutions includes the new robot-mounted MetraSCAN 3D scanner with CUBE-R, a turnkey industrial measuring cell that is designed to be integrated into factories for at-line inspections. Together, the solution provides customers with much faster cycle times, more accurate and repeatable results, higher resolution and operational simplicity, to increase productivity by measuring more dimensions on more parts without compromising on accuracy. Congratulations to the Creaform team for launching this outstanding new solution. Now shifting to acquisitions. While deal flow during the second quarter and third quarter has been impacted by the pandemic, we are starting to see a healthy pickup in activity. Our pipeline is strong and conversations with acquisition targets are accelerating. As Bill will highlight in a moment, over the last two quarters, we have further strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity position, and remain poised to deploy significant capacity -- capital on strategic acquisitions. We will remain active, yet disciplined, in our acquisition process. We continue to focus on acquiring niche technology leaders with attractive growth profiles with opportunities for us to add value commercially and operationally. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While the global economy continues to present challenges and uncertainties, visibility has improved across most markets. As a result, we are providing guidance for the fourth quarter. Overall sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be down high-single digits with a similar level of organic sales decline. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.04, down 4% to 7% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter decremental margins are expected to remain solid in the low 20%s. To summarize, our businesses delivered a solid quarter in a difficult environment. AMETEK continues to manage this global crisis well to the proven strength of the AMETEK growth model and with a talented workforce. Our cost mitigation efforts have allowed the company to weather this ongoing storm and we are confident that we will overcome these challenges with a bright future. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter. Then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. I’d like to echo Dave’s comments on the quarter, as we saw outstanding operating performance driven by the tremendous efforts of our team in a very challenging economic environment. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were down $4.5 million, compared to the same period of 2019, primarily due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary spending cuts. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.5% of sales in the quarter, down from 1.7% last year. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 17.5%, down from 19.5% in the same period last year. The lower tax rate in the quarter was due to returned provision adjustments and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings. For 2020, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%, and as we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Operating capital and working capital was an impressive 17% in the third quarter, down sequentially from the second quarter’s 19.6% on outstanding working capital management. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $10 million. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million, which is $5 million higher than our full year expectations last quarter, as we are investing in incremental growth opportunities. Our full year capital expenditures estimate remains below our initial expectations to start the year of $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $63 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $255 million, which includes after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Our businesses continue to generate strong levels of cash flow, despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $310 million, free cash flow was $300 million and free cash flow conversion was excellent at 146% of net income. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion, up slightly from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019 and down $68 million from the end of the second quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.1 times, as we are intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances. This was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5 times and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1 times at quarter end, which improved by 2 -- 0.2 turns in the quarter. We remain well-positioned to manage this economic downturn with approximately $2.3 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives. This includes approximately $1 billion in available revolver capacity. As we have highlighted on previous calls, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023. In summary, our businesses continue to manage through the pandemic exceptionally well, delivering strong operating results and high levels of cash flow. The dedication of our world-class workforce to serving our essential customers has truly been impressive. We remain well-positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges, while investing in our long-term growth initiatives. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew, we are ready to take questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Matt.
Matt Summerville: Walkthrough -- hey. Hey, Dave. I was wondering if you can maybe start by doing your more detailed walkthrough on the businesses, please?
Dave Zapico: Sure. I will start with the process business. Overall sales for process were down mid-single digits in the quarter. We had the contributions from the Gatan acquisition and they were offset by an organic sales decline and it was in line with AMETEK’s overall organic sales decline. We saw sequential improvements in sales during the quarter, with this improvement being widespread across our process businesses. Our CAMECA and ZYGO businesses had solvent quarters, driven in part by their exposures to research and semiconductor markets. They did very well and we expect continued solid sequential improvements in sales for process during the fourth quarter. I will go into aerospace next. Both overall and organic sales for our entire A&D business were down mid-teens in the quarter, showing nice sequential growth from the second quarter. Similar to the second quarter, there was a meaningful difference in performance between our defense and commercial aerospace businesses. Our defense businesses continue to see solid demand, with sales up low-double digits on a percentage basis versus last year, while the commercial aerospace businesses were down about 35% versus last year. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect demand to maintain -- to be relatively flat or sequentially versus the third quarter, as the broad commercial aerospace market continues to adjust to the uncertain demand environment due to COVID-19. And next our Power & Industrial market segment, overall sales for Power & Industrial were down low-double digits in the third quarter, with contributions from IntelliPower being offset by a mid-teens organic sales decline. Demand levels in the third quarter improved nicely from the second quarter and we expect sequential improvements again in the fourth quarter. And finally for our Automation & Engineered Solution market segment, organic sales in the third quarter for A&ES were down mid-teens on a percentage basis. We saw modest sequential improvements in these businesses in the third quarter as we had expected with applications tied to medical markets performing well. We also saw a return to growth in China for Automation & Engineered Solution business in the quarter and as with the other sub-segments we expect sequential improvements across both our Automation & Engineered Solution businesses in the fourth quarter. That’s a walk around the company, Matt.
Matt Summerville: Thanks, Dave. And then as my follow-up, can you comment on what your price realization was in Q3 and what you are looking for in terms of sourcing savings for the full year? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think the -- I will go with the price first. The -- we are very pleased to see our pricing held up well. Q3 was similar to Q2. We achieved about 0.5 of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs was about a point. So we had a 50 basis points of positive spread added to margins. And your second question was on sourcing savings, that -- we consider that part of structural savings and it was about $60 million.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. The one point, though, to finish, it was $60 million for the year, to Matt. And go ahead, Deane.
Deane Dray: Sure. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Dave Zapico: Hi.
Deane Dray: It’s great to see you guys are back in the quarterly guidance business, because that does speak to your earnings visibility. So, first question is, kind of related to this visibility, if you can take us through the cadence of the month in the quarter organically. Maybe how October month-to-date has looked and let’s start there, please?
Dave Zapico: Sure. In terms of orders in Q3, it was pretty typical trend for us with September being the strongest month of the quarter. In fact, it was our strongest month since I believe February back in Q1, when we started to really feel the impact of the virus. That’s orders. In terms of sales, September, again, was our highest month of the quarter and the highest month of the year so far. And in terms of October, obviously, it is not completed yet, but it looks good. Orders are trending well and it is supportive of our guidance in Q4, which shows solid sequential improvement.
Deane Dray: So did you see in the month that sequential improvement consistent through the quarter?
Dave Zapico: We saw sequential improvements in orders and sales. I believe August was a bit of an outlier, but August is always tricky for us. So in general, it was a trend upward with September the highest in both sales and in orders.
Deane Dray: Great. And then just kind of bridge this, degree of confidence in the sequential improvement. How this translates into your confidence in restoring guidance?
Bill Burke: Yeah. I think the confidence is really based on us becoming more confident with our ability to live with the virus and we have got visibility in our markets. We are seeing consistent improvement and consistent engagement with customers across all of our markets and we just got to the point where we were comfortable giving guidance. Our guidance range is a little bit wider than it typically is and that takes into account some of the uncertainty for the fourth quarter. But we just got comfortable, because our businesses are operating in a good rhythm and it builds a level of confidence with us.
Deane Dray: Great. And just my last question, not to oversimplify your mix and with respect to how you, in the last question, Matt’s question, you gave and highlighted those businesses. But if I thought about AMETEK and the strength of your medical and defense is probably -- those are probably the strongest here. How did those collectively do in the quarter? And then the weakest, which is more secular, it’s not execution. We get that, and actually, the commercial business you outperformed a number of your peers in this space in this market. So -- but the two sides to this medical, defense, how did they do versus the oil and gas and commercial aero on the other side?
Dave Zapico: All right. That’s a great question. One way to think about it is, if I take the two most challenged markets out, the commercial aerospace and the oil and gas, sales were down approximately 10%. And another way to think about that is, our defense showed strong growth in the third quarter, up mid-teens. Our healthcare business was just slightly down because of the -- we had COVID-related demand that was strong, but we had -- people weren’t going to hospitals and getting surgical procedures, so that was off a little bit. But the combinations of both the defense and medical was clearly our strongest and that was about flat.
Deane Dray: Terrific. And just a quick clarification, when you said flat for Q2 for aero, was that commercial aero and defense or was it combined?
Dave Zapico: So sequentially we are saying it’s going to be flat and that’s both for military and commercial aerospace.
Deane Dray: Got it. That is really helpful. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.
Dave Zapico: Hi, Scott.
Scott Graham: Hey. Good morning. Well done again.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Scott Graham: I do have a question first on, I think, an area that you might be most proud of this quarter, operating working capital. What did you do there to push that percentage down as much as you did, what happened?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. The first comment is, that’s one of the hallmarks of AMETEK is our-- we think about working capital is being very -- you have to run businesses where you are efficient with working capital and there’s some elements that really over performed and I will let Bill comment on that.
Bill Burke: Yeah. I think what you saw was our receivables performance has been fantastic. Our businesses have really done a great job staying close to our customers and understanding that pushing for payment. Our receivables were down to 46 days on a DSO basis, which is -- as well as it’s been in quite a while, so I think the teams did a fantastic job there. And then the other thing, it’s at little more difficult, especially when sales are declining as rapidly as they did earlier in the year is getting your supply chains realigned to that level of demand and they did a great job with that as well, and I think, you saw that play out in the third quarter. So I think those two things in combination really enabled us to reduce that working capital percentage to 17% and the teams have just done a fantastic job on that around the company.
Scott Graham: That’s great. Thank you, Bill. Now here is another one. The $90 million of expected full year temporary cost reductions, a lot of companies are saying, hey, not all of that comes back. What is your view on that for 2021 at this point? How much comes back? How much is maybe permanent?
Dave Zapico: The first point I would make is, the temporary cost savings will be at a run rate of about $10 million in the fourth quarter. The second point is related to next year. What we -- we are in a situation. We have to sit down with all of our teams, our budgeting processes in November. It’s a bottoms-up comprehensive planning process for each business unit. They are going to look at growth in each of their markets, customer plans, competitive dynamics, investment opportunities, capital projects, cost reductions and part of that discussion is going to be how fast the temporary costs are going to come back and what the impact is year-over-year. At a high level, travel is a part of that and it is going to come back slowly through the year, but some of the costs have already been restored. So we really don’t have a detailed plan on that next year, because we haven’t done our budgeting yet. We start that process in November. But that’s how I think about it.
Scott Graham: Okay. Last question. Thank you for that. On the M&A pipeline, obviously, you have a much broader swath of businesses today than you did even two years or three years ago, particularly, I look at Gatan and how you have gotten even more into the scientific markets. Could you give us something maybe a little bit more granular date on what you are looking for? And I know competitively you have got to be careful there. But I am assuming that medical, scientific/research would be really kind of at the top of the list for things you are looking for. Could you comment on that?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think that’s an area that we are definitely looking at. I mean it’s broad based. We -- as you know, we have a decentralized business model and we get acquisition plans rolled up through our businesses through an adjacency process. And we are looking at all parts of the business in all areas and we are seeing an uptick in opportunity -- uptick in discussions. But they could come from all parts of our business. But the area that you highlighted is a particularly interesting one to us.
Scott Graham: Very good. Thank you. Good job.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett.
Dave Zapico: Hello, Ivana
Ivana Delevska: Good morning. Good morning, guys. So, just wanted to ask, what percent of your portfolio may be excluding aero and defense and medical is levered to CapEx? And what are you seeing in those CapEx levered businesses?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I -- most of the products that we sell are at a price range that could be considered both OpEx or CapEx. So we really don’t segment it that way. But certainly the -- you think about the big projects and the big project businesses and our oil and gas business and our metals business and some of the heavier industries are delayed right now, but the operating expenditures are continuing. So I don’t have a percentage to give you but that’s how we think about it.
Ivana Delevska: And then in terms of the CapEx levered businesses, are those like down significantly more than the rest, would you say?
Dave Zapico: No. In fact, our -- in the research market for CAMECA, they are selling million -- $3 million tools and that’s one of the businesses that I highlighted in process to talk about on our -- so that’s not the case. I mean, that’s a university market or a research market, very expensive. The key there is that we have the best products and we are the only one in the world that makes an atomprobe and we have a unique SIMs capability. So people say they budget for our products and we build products, and they deliver them. So -- and CAMECA, which is a CapEx market for us, had one of their best quarters. So it is…
Ivana Delevska: Yeah. Yeah.
Dave Zapico: It’s really dependent on the customer dynamics.
Ivana Delevska: Got it. Thank you very much.
Dave Zapico: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for the question. So, Dave, I want to go back to the aerospace down 35%. It’s a steep decline for sure. But compared to sort of down 50 to 60% we have seen from so many other suppliers into that market. So I am just curious, would that be a reason why your decline would be significantly decoupled from what we see in the industry? I am thinking about any programs or any other factors, because that’s -- that does sound like it’s actually a pretty good performance?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it’s a -- it was a good performance. Remember, we thought we were going to be down in the mid-to-high 40s and we ended up down 35% in the commercial aerospace. Our teams did an excellent job. When you look at the different sub-segments, the third-party aftermarket and the commercial OEM ended up being down similar with business jet and we thought business jet would be higher and the third-party aftermarket and the commercial OEM would be lower and those two sub-segments performed better. But I -- that’s as much of backlog and things like that. Commercial is finding a bottom. There are many variables, including government support, airline capacity decisions, obviously, the confidence of the flying public. When we thought about our business sequentially, that’s the only part of our business we think will not improve. So definitely a better quarter, I can’t comment on the performance of other companies, because I really don’t know it. But I know our team did a good job on shipping product and as a negative 35%, pleased with the performance. This is as strange as that sounds.
Nigel Coe: Yeah. Right. That business is definitely getting better. And then just on cyclical costs, you gave some great detail there and I think you said $45 million of cost during 4Q. Is that a forward run rate, so as we go into 2021, are we looking at maybe, I don’t know, $40 or -- $40 million or so of kind of, like, carryover benefits into ‘21?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. First of all, Nigel, it’s $55 million of savings in Q4 and…
Nigel Coe: Okay.
Dave Zapico: … $45 million of it is structural and $10 million of it is temporary. And I am going to give you -- there’s a $50 million carryover from the restructuring that we did earlier in the year. But in terms of getting into any specifics, I am going to not answer the question for next year. Our budgeting process is going to be in November and really there’s a lot of discussion on cost reduction, investments and the temporary costs that are going to come back and that all goes into a mix. It will be a pretty complex budgeting process this year with the pandemic. There’s some extra variables in it. So I am not going to comment on what the savings will be for next year.
Nigel Coe: It sounds like you are still maybe configuring different actions in 4Q and just kind of like maybe set up a ‘21, would that be fair?
Dave Zapico: No. I don’t think so. But we are going to go through our budgeting processes and something may come out of there. But we don’t have anything planned in Q4.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hope all is well.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn: So just wondering if, in the current environment where some smaller companies might be concerned about global dynamics, supply chain, trade, et cetera, if you are picking up on any new motivations by sellers, including some you have tracked and quoted for some years?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think there is some activity out there where people are anticipating possibly a tax rate change. So there’s some people that are -- have their businesses out there as part of the uptick and pipeline opportunities. And in terms of the overall uncertainty in the global environment, if you are a smaller owner of a company that has all of these dynamics in terms of COVID and geopolitical issues, and issues with China, you are certainly a little unsettled. And we have known these people for year -- years and we are certainly having discussions with them in terms of when the right time for them to sell their business is.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And any changes in the competition for deals that you are interested in seeing?
Dave Zapico: I would say no competition change that is noticeable. It’s been about the same for the last couple years.
Christopher Glynn: Great. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.
Bill Burke: Good morning.
Andrew Obin: Just a couple people actually asked me, did I miss -- did you guys actually give us actual orders in the third quarter, you usually do that?
Bill Burke: Yeah. I can do that. Our overall orders were minus 8%, our organic orders were minus 12% and our book-to-bill was 1.01.
Andrew Obin: Okay. That was easy. And then the second question, just I will ask on elective procedures. I think most of your competitors sort of said that elective surgery is back to 90%, 95% level pre-COVID. Are you just -- has that been your experience and what are seeing on elective procedures into Q4?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think elective procedures for us, we think it is going to stay at a reduced level until next year, is the -- we are hearing from customers. So we think we will have another quarter in Q4 of some kind of reduced elective procedures and then it will recover next year. And I anticipate they are working off backlog and there is less demand with COVID, so that market will correct itself as time goes on.
Andrew Obin: But your experience is consistent sort of with the data that I cited that your competitors are citing, right?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I am not sure what our competitors have cited. But we are down a bit in numbers that you put out there 90% or 95% kind of makes sense.
Andrew Obin: Okay. And just to ask Ivana’s question in a slightly different way, on the way up as IP recovers, what kind of revenue leverage to IP should we be thinking for your portfolio ex aero and maybe ex healthcare?
Dave Zapico: Go ahead.
Bill Burke: Yeah. That’s something we are going to talk about with our businesses, but historically, AMETEK has recovered very well from significant downturns and we are seeing the improvement in Q3 versus Q2. We are anticipating seeing it in Q4 versus Q3, and historically, we have really performed well in upticks. So we have a mid and long cycle business and we are seeing good improvements. And what you are seeing is now is short cycle activities picking up. So that should bode well for the future. But we are going to go through our budgets and figure everything out.
Andrew Obin: Thank you so much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.
Brett Linzey: Hey. Good morning all. Maybe first question, just on defense and medical, first on the defense side, very strong 2020 continues to look pretty good here. What is your visibility in that business next year based on wins or platforms you are on, clearly a tough comp, but can you see that growing still next year? And then on the medical side, any identifiable COVID-related opportunities that you could point to or even quantify that could pop up here over the coming months?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. The first question is, I am really not going to comment on the military demand environment next year, but the spending pattern, those things are relatively healthy and we will see what the political environment brings, but usually those changes occur slowly over time. So you think the overall spending environment will be supportive next year and our quoting activity shows that. In terms of the COVID-related products, I mean, the first thing I pointed to is the land temperature measurement, where we are doing body temperature scanning. When I came into work today, I went through the land system. It’s very quick, easy, efficient and measures body temperature. The other things that are happening in our Automation business, there’s a lot of COVID testing devices that require sample automation, movement of samples very precisely through testing. The demand in that business is very strong. We are also seeing some demand for temporary setups in hospital type situations with our Rauland Healthcare businesses. So we are really seeing some pockets of improved demand and that’s built into the overall story.
Brett Linzey: Got it. That’s great. And then just in terms of the geographic complexion. Could you maybe give us a little more color, what sales or order rates? And then I am actually curious specific on Europe in October with the lockdown chatter and maybe even enactment was starting to percolate a little bit. Did you see a…
Dave Zapico: Right.
Brett Linzey: … slowing kind of late in October in Europe? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Yeah. I will take the second question first. I mean, our orders for October are very good. They are in line with what we are expecting and we are seeing no geographical problems at this point. In terms of the third quarter, the geographical third quarter, we had positive sequential trends across all geographies, with Europe and U.S. remaining the most challenged. So the U.S. was down I think 13%, broad based weakness. Europe was down 20% on broad based weakness. Asia was down mid-single digits. We had a good strength in EMG in China and China was positive at plus 3% for us. So -- but all geographies improved sequentially.
Brett Linzey: Got it. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Brett.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Robert Jamieson: Hey. Good morning, This is Robert. Hey. Good morning. It’s Robert in for Joe this morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot has been covered. I guess a quick one on the structural and variable costs for Q4, is there any -- is that pretty evenly split between the EIG and EMG, anything you can give about it?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. It is. It is pretty well split between the two. So EIG is a little bit higher because of the relative size of it, but it is split based on volume.
Robert Jamieson: Okay. Great. And then can you provide another update on Gatan’s performance so far and how that has been progressing versus expectations and synergies into next year?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I mean, we met our year-one profitability target. So we are going to be reviewing that with our Board next week. We had a very good first year. The team did an excellent job. We had -- We were helped by COVID-related sales, about half of that business was life sciences and we also announced the combining of our Gatan with our EDX business [ph] in similar market, so we drove excellent synergy. So very positive and the K3 camera helped us solve some of the COVID-related problems, being the first camera to structure the virus. So all very good and the people of Gatan are very proud of that. Okay?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.
Andrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew
Bill Burke: Good morning.
Andrew Buscaglia: So, Dave, you talked about, you reinstated quarterly guidance, and you mentioned, visibility getting a little bit better, which is interesting. Some companies aren’t willing to say that yet or hesitate into year-end still a lot of uncertainty. So I guess, where are you seeing across your space, where are you feeling more comfortable, obviously in some areas with, by nature, like military spending, you kind of have better visibility just all the time. But I guess, where do you get more comfortable saying that and maybe is this coming from some of the conversations you are having with some of your customers?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. That’s a great question, Andrew. And when you think about it, we are getting better at living with the virus. Our customers are getting better at living with the virus. Our suppliers are getting better at living with the virus. And there is an uptick in cases, especially in Europe and the Western U.S. and we are watching that closely. But we expect to continue to run as an essential business and our customers are essential customers and they are expecting to continue to run. So business activity levels are continuing to improve and even in Europe when you some increased lockdowns to certain degrees, essential businesses are still operating. So that is really the broader context that we used to reinstate guidance and talking with our teams they are confident they can deliver the fourth quarter.
Andrew Buscaglia: Yeah. That’s fair. And you talked about -- this quarter about some benefits from COVID and some COVID-related products. I guess, it’s hard -- you have a lot going on on that side. I guess how much of it do you think is sustainable demand into 2021? I guess, I mean, how would you characterize sort of a temporary bump in demand related to those products versus something that might linger next year and beyond?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. As I said, a couple of times, we are not going to talk about next year. We are going to work with our teams. But in general, we are seeing a pretty substantial improvement quarter-to-quarter and we will find out the details with our teams. But I would expect that improvement trend will continue into next year, and as I talked earlier on this call about AMETEK, typically has responded positively to a deep downturn. So we will find that all out. We don’t know about the timing and there may be some COVID-related demand that falls off. But there is also going to be some demand that was impacted by COVID that is going to improve. So we will figure that out during our budget process.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. All right. That’s fair. Thanks, David.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo.
Michael McGinn: Hey, guys. Mike on for Allison. Thanks for the question. 
Dave Zapico: Hi, Mike.
Bill Burke: Hi.
Michael McGinn: I want to go back to the capital allocation discussion. So as you move into the heavy R&D industries with the bolt-on acquisitions from versus maybe more material and direct COGS industries. Is there any discussion on the way you approach and report gross margin, which I believe differs from your peers at?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Our cost of sales includes engineering and that’s historically how we have done that and we have not had a discussion recently of changing that.
Michael McGinn: Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess switching to some of your end markets. I believe you have an Automation & Engineered Solution platform that was approaching $1.5 billion prior to downturn. So I was curious what are near-shoring or re-shoring kind of player theme would look like for you guys in the businesses that would be most impactful for?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Automation is one of them. Automation did well in the third quarter. It did better than our Engineered Services business and they are seeing that demand. They also saw good strength in China from that. And when you think about the product that I talked about today from Creaform, that’s all product for at-line metrology. So our Automation businesses and Instrumentation businesses are very well-positioned to do -- to improve in an environment that includes re-shoring. We have a lot of products that our customers use to make their manufacturing more efficient and more productive. So that’s kind of in our sweet spot.
Michael McGinn: Okay. And so is it fair to say that some of those businesses have a higher Vitality Index than maybe the Legacy AMETEK platform? I believe you said it was like 25% this quarter. Just is that where the R&D focus is now and going forward?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think the R&D focus is EIG-biased versus EMG and the Vitality Index is higher in those kind of businesses. So that would be a correct view from your view -- your viewpoint.
Michael McGinn: Okay. Appreciate the time. I will pass it along.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Bill Burke: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Coleman for any closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew. And thank you everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, replay of the webcast can be accessed in the Investor section of ametek.com. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

We'll begin today with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Despite an economic environment as challenging and uncertain as any we have ever faced in AMETEK, our businesses stood strong in the second quarter delivering outstanding operating performance that exceeded expectations. I wanted to start by thanking all AMETEK colleagues who are working tirelessly through this pandemic to provide our customers with great products and exceptional service. As our result of test, our employees are doing an amazing job. The safety of our employees remains our highest priority. We continue to implement our pandemic response plan, which provides a pandemic for our businesses to manage our facilities and workforce during this pandemic. We are following CDC and local health and safety guidelines and are adjusting and enhancing our safety protocols as required to ensure safe working environment for our employees. Now let me turn to our results for the quarter. Sales in the second quarter were $1.01 billion, down 22% versus the second quarter of 2019. Organic sales were also down 22% with recent acquisitions contributing 4%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys a three point headwind and foreign currency a one point headwind. Despite substantial demand weakness, as our business delivered exceptional operating performance. Operating income in the quarter was $227 million and operating margins were very strong at 22.4%, while decremental margins were an impressive 25%. EBITDA in the second quarter was $289.7 million and EBITDA margins were a record 28.6%, up 160 basis points over last year's second quarter. This drove earnings of $0.84 per diluted share, down 20% versus the second quarter of 2019. Our cash generation in the quarter was superb. Operating cash flow was up 28% year-over-year to $315 million. Free cash flow conversion was also exceptionally strong at 183% of net income. Our businesses are focused on controlling what they can. The operating performance in the quarter is validation of the strength and flexibility of our asset-light business model, the quality of our niche businesses, and most importantly, the talent and commitment of our workforce. Next, I will provide some additional details at the operating group level. Second quarter sales for Electronic Instruments Group were $647.9 million, down 21% from the same period last year. Organic sales were down 26% with the acquisition of Gatan and IntelliPower contributing 5%. Despite the impact COVID-19 had on sales, our EIG businesses delivered excellent operating performance. EIG's operating income in the second quarter was $159.6 million and operating margins remained strong at 24.6%. The Electromechanical Group also delivered excellent operating results, driven by better than expected organic sales and their operational excellence initiatives, which contributed to exceptional margin expansion. EMG's sales were $364 million, down 22% versus the prior year's second quarter. Organic sales were down 16% with the recent acquisition of PDT adding 3%, the divestiture of Reading Alloys was an eight point headwind and foreign currency was a one point headwind. EMG's margin expansion was outstanding in the quarter. While operating income decreased to $84.3 million, operating margins expanded an impressive 170 basis points to a record 23.2% driven by our proactive operational excellence initiatives. Truly exceptional work by our teams. Now let me provide some color on the different end market dynamics we are experiencing within our business. AMETEK serves a diverse set of end markets. And across these end markets, we are seeing very different levels of demand and COVID-19 impacts. So as I did last quarter, I'll group our businesses into three buckets based on the levels of demand we are experiencing and provide some commentary on each. I'll start with the most challenging markets, commercial aerospace and oil and gas, which combined account for approximately 15% of AMETEK's sales. The weakness in commercial aerospace was largely as expected and driven by the impacts of COVID-19 on both our commercial OEM and aftermarket businesses. We expect these businesses to remain challenged for the balance of the year. Along with the impact from COVID-19, weakness in our oil and gas business was a result of difficult prior year comparison given several large project shipments last year. As a result, we expect solid sequential improvements in this business during the third quarter and fourth quarters. Combined, sales for aerospace, commercial aerospace and oil and gas were down approximately 45% in the quarter. Excluding these two markets, AMETEK's sales were down mid-teens on a percentage basis in the second quarter. Next, our strongest markets, defense and medical. Combining these markets account for over 20% of our sales and we have been experiencing solid internal growth, while also strategically expanding our portfolio in these areas through acquisitions. In the second quarter, sales were up low-single-digits for these businesses and we expect this strength to continue in the third quarter and fourth quarters. And for the balance of our markets, which include power, industrial, automation, metals, food and beverage and research, we were seeing demand levels somewhere in between those other two streams. We expect to see sequential improvements through the balance of the year for these businesses also. To offset these COVID-19-driven demand challenges, we remain focused on actively managing our cost structure through a mix of structural and temporary cost actions. Our executive office meets regularly with each of our businesses to review current market conditions, their demand outlook for the coming months and their operational plans. It is critical that each of our businesses develop an operating plan customized for their business, and that this operating planning be adjusted if conditions change. This flexibility is key in our asset-light operating model where costs can be quickly variablized. This approach allows us to best align our cost structure with demand levels we are experiencing by market and by business. We have the flexibility to expand cost savings initiatives or as demand continues -- demand conditions improve, we can add back costs as required. In the second quarter, we generated $85 million in total cost savings with $35 million in structural savings and $50 million in temporary cost savings. This level of savings was above our initial estimate of $80 million total cost savings in the quarter. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect approximately $65 million in total cost savings with $35 million to $40 million in structural and $25 million to $30 million in temporary savings. And for the full year, we now expect structural savings of $135 million and will flex our temporary cost savings either up or down based on volume levels in the fourth quarter. The spread of the coronavirus has oddly forced companies to adapt and adjust how they do business. Work from home requirements and travel restrictions have changed our company's interact and engage with customers. Our businesses have been proactive in developing and utilize digital capabilities to help them stay engaged with our customers. Our sales and engineering teams are working side-by-side with our customers through digital channels to cultivate and build relationships. These initiatives have included virtual events through newly implemented digital platforms to provide product demos, webinars and collaborative business meetings. Finally, some of our teams are finding innovative ways to help provide aftermarket services for our customers through interactive technologies. I commend our teams for quickly adapting to the new reality and for embracing these new ways of doing business. We remain committed to investing in additional technologies to support our customer experience. Despite the global demand challenges, AMETEK continues to invest meaningfully in new product development initiatives. We are seeing great success from these investments as our businesses are introducing many new innovative solutions to help solve our customers' greatest challenges. Our vitality index, which measures the amount of sales generated from new products introduced during the last three years was very strong at 26%. And here are just a few of the recent examples of new product introductions. AMETEK Land, a leading manufacturer of non-contact temperature measurement solutions saw a robust demand in the second quarter for their new VIRALERT 3. This newly developed non-contact temperature measurement solution is used to rapidly detect elevated skin temperature, while allowing users to adhere to social distancing requirements. The safe, non-contact easy-to-use and highly accurate temperature solution is being used at entry points of offices, warehouses, hospitals, schools and recreational facilities. Given the product's ability to complete, accurate temperature screenings of scale, the VIRALERT 3 is playing a role in reopening key facilities around the world. Creaform, a leader in 3D measurement technologies released the latest solution in their MetraSCAN 3D line. The MetraSCAN Black is the fastest and most accurate 3D scanner in the world with four times the speed and resolution of its predecessor. The MetraSCAN Black can withstand harsh production environments and is utilized in the most complex quality control and quality assurance applications. This incredibly versatile instrument can be used to scan various part sizes and service finishes in real-time all with the same device. And additionally, MOCON, a leading global provider of food package testing Instruments released their latest version of the Dansensor CheckPoint. This new portable head space gas analyzer provides quality control managers a more precise, faster and more stable solution for measuring gases in specific food applications using Modified Atmosphere Packaging or MAP. MAPs are used to extend the shelf life for packaged foods and pharmaceutical products requiring specialized packaging. Congratulations to the Land, Creaform and MOCON teams on these impressive new product developments. Now shifting to acquisitions. The overall M&A market remains relatively quiet given the high levels of uncertainty around the coronavirus and its impact on the economy. That being said, our M&A teams remain very active and we are managing several opportunities. We have a very strong balance sheet and liquidity position and the ability to deploy meaningful amounts of capital on acquisitions. Our preference remains deploying that capital on strategic acquisitions that provide us the ability to add high quality companies to our portfolio and drive excellent returns for our shareholders. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. High levels of uncertainty remain given the continuing spread of the coronavirus, especially throughout parts of the U.S. While visibility has improved from this point last quarter, it is still limited as customers remain cautious. As a result, we will not be providing guidance for the third quarter or the full year. We will issue guidance as conditions stabilize and visibility improves. However, I did want to provide some high level comments around the third quarter and the balance of the year given what we know now. First, we expect to see sequential improvements in the third quarter and fourth quarters with commercial aerospace being the only business not expected to see sequential improvements. Second, we still expect very strong decremental margins at approximately 30% in the third quarter. And lastly, we now expect full year decremental margins in the 25% range versus our previous estimate of 25% to 30% decrementals. In summary, AMETEK managed well through what was an extraordinarily challenging environment during the second quarter. The strength of the AMETEK growth model was evident in our second quarter performance and we will continue to allow us to operate at a high level through this dynamic market conditions. We are taking responsible cost actions and continuing to invest in our businesses to ensure they are poised to generate strong growth coming out of the downturn. We also have a robust balance sheet and liquidity position to allow us to capitalize on what we believe will be an opportunistic period for acquisitions. Finally, we're confident that AMETEK will emerge from these challenges a stronger organization, given the growth profiles of our differentiated businesses, the company's financial strength, and most importantly, the impressive level of talent within our world-class workforce. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'd be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. I'd like to echo Dave's comments on the outstanding efforts of our employees around the world. They continue to deliver exceptional performance during these challenging times. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were down $1.7 million compared to the same period in 2019 due to lower compensation costs and other discretionary spending cuts. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.5%, down from 20.4% in the same period last year. The lower rate in the quarter was due to tax planning initiatives. For 2020, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was 19.6% versus 18.3% in last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $10 million. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million, down from our initial expectations to start the year of $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $61 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $260 million, which includes after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $117 million or $0.51 per diluted share. Our businesses continue to generate high levels of cash. Operating cash flow in the quarter was excellent at $315 million, up 20% over last year's comparable quarter. Free cash flow was also outstanding at $305 million, up 36% over the same period last year, and free cash flow conversion was superb at 183% of net income. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.87 billion, up modestly from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019 and down $383 million from the end of the first quarter as we repaid a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.13 billion. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.1 times as we are intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances. This ratio was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5 times. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.3 times at quarter end. And both our gross and net debt to EBITDA ratios improved by 0.1 turns in the quarter. AMETEK remains well positioned to manage this economic downturn with approximately $2.1 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives. This includes over $950 million in available revolver capacity. As we highlighted on our last call, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023. To conclude, our ability to deliver solid results with outstanding cash generation despite these unprecedented challenges is a testament to the strength of our businesses and the dedication of our world-class workforce. The AMETEK growth model and our financial strength firmly position us to manage this economic environment and invest in future growth to deliver long-term success. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew, could we please open the line for questions?
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions. First, Dave, can you talk about what you saw from an organic order standpoint in the quarter and maybe provide some color on kind of what the monthly year-over-year cadence may have looked like from April into July?
Dave Zapico: Right. Our overall orders were down negative 22% and organic was down about the same, so really aligned with our sales. Both of our groups were down and really followed sales. And we ended up with a book-to-bill of about 0.99. And for orders, the April was a low point in the quarter. It grew nicely in May and then again in June. So it followed the similar trend for sales.
Matt Summerville: And then can you talk about your expectation for second half decrementals? You indicated in Q3 may be expecting something a little worse than what you had in Q2. So maybe what's driving that? And then maybe put that in the context of the sustainability you see for the record EMG margin performance you generated in the quarter? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. The first point is the -- the second point -- I'll answer your second question first. The EMG margins were exceptional and they were driven by strong operating performance. We had positive mix in our defense businesses and we also had the divestiture of Reading Alloys that contributed 50 basis points at the EMG level. So EMG had a great quarter. And the majority of that margin expansion was driven by excellent operating capability. In terms of the decrementals, I mean, we had good decrementals in both parts of the business. We had 16% decrementals in EMG and 31% in EIG, and those are really good. And in terms of the guidance of 30% decrementals for Q3, we're adding back some cost and we're really preparing for a larger fourth quarter. So -- and still for the full year, we increased our decrementals from 30% to 25%. So that's what we're doing. We're managing the business looking at -- focused on cash, focused on managing the decrementals and focused on driving key growth opportunities. And we're doing an excellent job of managing the decrementals and really kept our net income, our cash EPS down at the same level of our sales drop, which is pretty amazing when you consider the profitability level of the company. So we're pretty pleased with that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Hi guys, good morning. Dave, could you talk with -- I know you mentioned the structural versus cyclical costs, but could you give a little bit more color on the structural cost savings that you're doing? Is it widespread across the verticals or is it focused specific on the more challenged ones like aerospace?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I would say the structural costs are more focused on the more challenged markets. And they're resizing those businesses to the new demand level that we have. Those businesses are profitable. They will remain profitable on the way down. And the way we're looking at it as the businesses started to grow from the bottom will be very profitable on the way up. So there is a quick change in revenue and the team have done an excellent job of adjusting to the new demand level. Also there was an element of those structural savings that are pulled forward from projects in our strategic plan. So we look forward out every three years and if we get a time like this, we pull forward some projects that are some efficiency, some plant consolidations, but mainly the structural -- while across the board, they were mainly targeted at the commercial aerospace and oil and gas business.
Allison Poliniak: Great. And then just turning to the M&A given you know obviously it's still challenged there. But could you give us a little color on your pipeline in terms of size? Have you pivoted to specific end market vertical? And I guess even just comfort level, just given the uncertainty relative to the size of potential deals like you're likely looking at?
Dave Zapico: Great question. I mean, as you know Alison, M&As remains our first priority. And we feel there is going to be a substantial opportunity for us as we get through this crisis because there's going to be pent-up demand on deals. And we have the balance sheet and the cash flow generating capability to execute on the opportunity. And while the broader deal activity is due right now, we're very active in pipeline development. And we actually have a couple of deals we're looking at right now. So we're actually in diligence. And those are deals that have been working to our pipeline. There are larger deals and there are smaller deals. So I'm quite optimistic on the pipeline. But you still have the situation where to get to the end of a deal buyers and sellers have to agree on new pricing expectations based on the cash flow visibility and that impacts the evaluation process. And we're adjusting our process because we have the inability to perform the face-to-face diligence that we used to take for granted. And we still need to have some of that to feel comfortable in what we're buying. So we still think it's going to be late 2020 before the market returns to new -- to some kind of normal, but we are active on some properties right now. So I'm pretty pleased with how hard the team is driving the pipeline, and there is good candidates in our pipeline.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning. Dave, can you just remind us with all of the structural and temporary cost elements coming in, and I know you're still kind of leaving it open on the fourth quarter based on demand, how should we all in think about incremental margins for next year because obviously there's a lot of torque in the business, gross margins are high, so volume recovery would feel pretty good. But if I had to crosscheck that against maybe some of the temporary costs that come out, still fair to say that incrementals can start with the three next year or should we think about that differently or maybe more specifically knowing what we know about the temporary side?
Dave Zapico: Right. That's a great question. And I don't think there's any doubt that incrementals can start with the three. If you look at past downturns, AMETEK's really driven margin expansion as we come out of the downturns. And the temporary costs we're going to put back in as we progress throughout the year, but that's not stopping us from putting up positive incrementals. So I think largely, you're going to end up with contribution margins in 2021 in that kind of range, and I'm optimistic about that. Because the other thing you have to factor in is our pricing. Our pricing was very strong in the quarter and it's holding up well and we're very pleased with it.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then kind of a two-part second question. First, anything on July, I think Matt Summerville asked about it, but I don't know if there is anything specific? And maybe talk around the role of backlog in some of the momentum? Are you feeling like you're living hand to mouth in most of the businesses or was backlog maybe kind of distorting 2Q where there is still some longer cycle businesses that need to run off?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. No, our backlog is pretty flat at $1.7 billion. And as you know, we went through our guidance. But what you and what Matt were asking is a sense of where the business is going forward, and we can give you that. I mean, if you start with Q2, our sales, April was the worst and improved in May and further improvement in June. And if you look at that improvement trend and you look at July, which is supportive of it, we think that we'll be down roughly 50% in the third quarter. But that's an estimate based on what we know and there are many uncertainties. But that's kind of what we're tracking to right now. And it kind of...
Josh Pokrzywinski: Understood.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Okay.
Josh Pokrzywinski: That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, Dave. I'll get back in queue.
Dave Zapico: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. So you mentioned research. I'm just curious kind of how you research end markets performed. Can't imagine the stay at home, work from home trend is really helpful there. So just curious what you're seeing there, because I know that's more of an EIG kind of exposure?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I think the -- I'll break the research market into a couple of different areas. In the material science area of research, both university and corporate R&D, it was weak. Those projects have been pushed to the right. But in the life sciences area, the market is holding up very well. And it was shown by our Gatan business, the business that we acquired last year. They had performed very well, slightly ahead of our expectations and actually had flat revenue year-over-year in the second quarter with our top-line well and that was driven by the life sciences market. And Gatan products have been influential in the fight against COVID. In fact, researchers at the University of Texas used Gatan K3 camera. They were the first people to structurally image the spike protein on the coronavirus. So that's driven a lot of excitement in demand around the demand tools. In fact, Gatan K3 was the first person to structure the coronavirus. The next two people that did use the K2, which is slower. And the speed of the cameras, the K3 is faster, allowed the researchers to get done quicker. So good demand drivers in that business. And it really points to again our research market. There are some areas that are doing very well, some areas that aren't, and in certain parts of the world, those research institutions have not really opened up, they're still close. So we're hanging in there, but it's a complex story.
Nigel Coe: Okay. So on balance, doesn't feel like it's any worse than the average. And then maybe just a little bit context on the geo markets. If you could give us how U.S., Europe, China, etc. are performing versus -- and then just on the export exposure, has that changed materially over the last several years? And I'm just curious how the U.S. dollar weakness maybe benefits you going forward?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. As you know, we're naturally hedged at the top-line and the bottom line based on currency. So the currency swing doesn't really impact our profitability. But when the dollar weakens, we do get more competitive. So it's something that we're looking at. So it's a good thing for us because we export over $1 billion. And in terms of the geographical story line, we really have broad-based weakness, and Europe and the U.S. were most challenged. Europe was down 29% on broad weakness and it also had a difficult comp because there was some Middle East project business for our oil and gas business. U.S. was down about 20%, but it was pretty broad-based. And Asia was the best of the markets that was down mid-teens and had notable strength in Asia in our automation business. China improved for us. China was actually up 3%. So positive rebound in China driven by our automation & CAMECA business. So that's the story; broad-based weakness and Asia was the best driven by China.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, I did notice that you guys put free cash flow in your release for the first time. So we really do appreciate that.
Dave Zapico: I'll let Kevin know that. Kevin has got a smile on his face.
Deane Dray: I'm sure he does, because I've pestered him about that for quite a while, but we really do appreciate it. But now I feel obligated to ask a free cash flow question. So here it is. Did you benefit at all from the timing of tax payments? We've seen other companies that have had upside on free cash flow. So was that a factor?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Not a huge factor, Deane. It was probably about $18 million or so. So that $183 million would still be a pretty strong number, probably in the mid-160s to 170 kind of a place.
Deane Dray: Good. And I really like how you segment the business in those three buckets just to kind of give us the color real-time as to the COVID impact. And last quarter, I'm pretty sure you included defense in the better bucket, better performing and it got called out as a positive mix this quarter as well for EMG. Can you comment on defense? And should it be in that bucket?
Dave Zapico: Defense was in the good markets in both last quarter and this quarter. So defense -- the buckets haven't changed and defense and medical were positive in Q2 and they were also positive in Q3. And as you recall, our defense business is about 5% of the company, and it's doing extremely well. It was up low-double-digits in the quarter. So while the commercial market was challenged, the defense market was strong.
Deane Dray: Great. And then on Gatan, really like that -- the update there and especially on the imaging of the spore. When is the next generation due to be release? Will that be the K4?
Dave Zapico: It is. There is a K3 Plus and the K4, we're working on them both. And we haven't announced when the next one will come to market.
Deane Dray: Terrific. All right, last question on capex. So you had cut $25 million out just for cash preservation. When might that come back? And just share with us a bit of your decision making as to what would you trim and why? And when you bring, what types of projects do you bring back on? Thanks.
Bill Burke: Yeah. The important point for us is our RD&E spending is roughly flat with 2019. So we thought that was going to be up coming into the year and we trim that back to flat, but we're really investing in RD&E. And the types of things we've delayed are expansions in regions of the world where we're trying to put extra capacity in place in a new region of the world that we're putting some capacity. And so those kind of projects got delayed. Quite honestly, we have decentralized the entrepreneurial team. And they understand the situation, so they make natural decisions and we really don't have to push that number. That's what comes up to us. That's where our business leaders want to spend. And I can see as we get later in the year, start evaluating, turning on some of those expansion projects we have in the various geographies of the world that we put on hold, but it's very difficult to complete those.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.
Rob Wertheimer: Thanks, and good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Rob. Congratulations on the book.
Rob Wertheimer: Thank you so much. It's kind. So I just have two questions on the temporary side, if I can. I think last quarter you talked about delays and difficulties in getting the customer sites or whatever, pushing out a little bit of revenue. Is that still ongoing? And does that come back at any point? That's the first.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. That certainly was with us throughout all of Q2. And it's still a bit of an issue, especially now traveling in the U.S. And really when it comes to, you can travel, but you're quarantined. And that was a big issue in China. Now that's abated, but that's a spotty issue around the world. And it was a big factor in Q2, it will be a diminishing factor in Q3.
Rob Wertheimer: And then does that -- a few points of revenue that kind of come back to you in 4Q or whatever or is there risk that it cancels or is it too small?
Dave Zapico: No, no. That's -- that will come back. And they've been rescheduled and pushing things out, but it will definitely come back.
Rob Wertheimer: Perfect. And then on the cost side, if I may. Can you kind of roll the temporary costs indefinitely? The way you described it, it's obvious that commercial aero maybe in trouble, oil and gas for a bit. And so maybe more permanent restructuring is appropriate there. But for the other markets that are just depressed during COVID and we don't know when it comes back, can you roll that indefinitely or does that come a point where costs have to sort of come back in the system?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. That's a good question, Rob. And when we did a restructuring early on, you'll recall. And we think we got the balance correct, but -- and we'll bring back those temporary costs. But if it gets to the point where there is diminished long-term viewpoint on revenue, then it doesn't -- we can't run with the temporary cost forever. So it's a -- I view those temporary costs as coming out -- coming back during the course of the year. And if demand doesn't come back, then we may have to do something extra on the cost side. But we're certainly not looking at that as a long-term situation.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Dave, you mentioned some different adaptations around delivering, administering some of your aftermarket services operation. I'm wondering if you're revealing any -- or any businesses coming up with delivery models that might actually be productivity levers and kind of remain post-COVID?
Dave Zapico: That's really the case. The accelerated adoption of digital capabilities is really opening our eyes. And it's obviously in the digital marketing area and the way we interact with our customers. The one thing I'd point to is in the -- we have complex systems that are installed and calibrated and they need commissions and we have some service teams that are using augmented reality to remotely service and install our products and really interesting tools right now. So I think some of those will be long lasting. And we're certainly adapting our business and learning as we move through this pandemic.
Christopher Glynn: Okay, thanks. And then in terms of the third quarter outlook for kind of everything getting a little better versus other than commercial aerospace, any -- some areas maybe you could call out where you're seeing the sharpest kind of rebounds, in particular, anything just getting back to normal?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Our automation business is kind of let us back. That's doing well. Our oil and gas business is going to recover, but that's because of a lack of a comp as much as anything. So those two businesses are ones that will recover. And I think our defense business will be strong. And the other thing we see is in the medical space. We saw really good demand on the COVID-related products, like COVID testing and COVID breathing apparatus, but we saw the elective surgeries tail off. In the second half of the year what our medtech customers are telling us is the elective surgeries are going to rebound. So that's the kind of things I'd point you to.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning, Dave, Bill, Kevin. So I wanted to understand a little bit more on the cost side where you talked about third quarter your cost reductions are going to be $65 million. If my calculations here are right that you were a little bit below what the annualized number would be for structural in the quarter and that should pick up in the second half of the year, which would suggest a pretty significant reduction in your temporary in the third quarter, yet you're not providing full year EPS guidance. So I guess, I'm trying to maybe connect those dots there, if you're dropping down on the temporary, why don't you feel more comfortable with giving guidance?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. There are too many variables and uncertainties to give guidance with our difficult precision. And I do appreciate your question and I understand what you're asking for that information in normal times. We'd give you that type of information, but these aren't normal times. And we withdrew our guidance and we just don't feel comfortable putting it back in place yet because of COVID and the lack of visibility and with the typical precision that we have.
Scott Graham: Can I maybe take a stab at one of them. Would it be that you're unable to project what your second half mix will be? Is that part of it?
Dave Zapico: No, I don't think that's -- I mean, I was pleased with the mix hold up, the pricing hold up. That's -- that isn't a concern. It's really you if you think about it, we're in a pandemic. And we don't -- we can have hotspots to show up in places and we're constantly managing things. So there is a lot of uncertainty now, and we just don't feel we can give guidance with a typical precision.
Scott Graham: Understood. Thank you. A couple of others, if you could. Typically you give that by business unit stuff, maybe you can just kind of call out specifically what you saw in the quarter in automation, power, research specifically? And maybe if you could split for us commercial aerospace, OE versus aftermarket?
Bill Burke: Right. I'll take you through the market segment commentary because that covers a lot of ground, and I think we'll be able to answer your questions there. Our process business, overall sales were down high-teens in the quarter. And we had the contributions from Gatan, offset by organic sales declines in line with AMETEK's organic sales decline. And we talked about widespread travel restrictions. And in addition to project push outs and delays in our ability to provide service, so that impacted process significantly. The largest weakness in process was in oil and gas business. Our medical businesses performed well in the quarter, as did our Zygo business. Zygo is seeing solid growth driven by some semiconductor fabrication work and Extreme UV, EUV. And while the end markets remain challenged and visibility is limited, we do expect to see sequential improvements in the third quarter and fourth quarters across our process businesses, including oil and gas. In aerospace, I think we've talked about that. We were -- the defense business was up low-double-digits. The commercial business was down in the high-40s. In the commercial business, the aftermarket was a little worse and the OE was a little better. We expect our defense businesses to stay strong in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And the commercial aerospace business, it's bouncing around bottom and we may have some shifts between aftermarket and OE, but we're not calling that one out as improving. We may be conservative on that, but that's where we are. In our power and industrial business, they were down in high-20 range. A lot of similar dynamics to our process business. Demand impacted by the global shutdowns and travel restrictions. And we're looking to -- the orders in our power business were stronger. And we're looking to second half where we expect conditions to improve modestly with sequential growth in both our power and industrial businesses. And finally, our automation and engineered solution businesses, they were down mid-teens on a percentage basis. And we're seeing automation trends improve across Asia, within China. And healthcare is the other big driver for our automation business. So we're seeing good sequential improvements there. And we expect that to continue in the second half.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett.
Ivana Delevska: Good morning, guys. So I just wanted to ask about the structural cost opportunities as we get into next year. I know there was some volume-related benefits that you were originally expecting to get this year that may get pushed out the next year. So could you just give us a sense of like, how do you see next year shaping up? And what will be the different buckets?
Dave Zapico: Sure. We haven't done a lot of thinking about next year at this point. But the one thing that we do know, we'll probably have about $50 million -- $45 million or $50 million flowing over into next year from the structural reductions that we did in 2020. So we'll have a good head start on whatever cost reduction plans that we put together. And we'll couple that with the traditional material cost to us and the other projects that we'll put together. And we typically have a pretty healthy project list, and we decide on that list during our budgeting process. So haven't really done much planning, but we have a good sense -- a good head start with the structural flow over from the things we've done in 2020.
Ivana Delevska: And how much was the volume like sourcing expected to help this year that didn't materialize because of the environment?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, sourcing was a big driver, and I'm just going from memory now and Kevin can -- you can check this with Kevin before that. But we probably lost about $10 million or $20 million of sourcing savings because the volume isn't there and we had to make that up by the other structural savings.
Ivana Delevska: Perfect. And just one more question in terms of synergy realization. Could you compare next year to this year in terms of how much synergies you expect from the different deals and the timing?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. The way I can answer that is we're on track with all of our deals. I mentioned, Gatan, that's the biggest deal that we did last year, and we just did a review of that business. And we're actually slightly ahead of our acquisition model. So when we combine that business with our EDAX business, it's another business within our portfolio, and they're in the same market. So that combination is driving this synergy and they have the same customer base. And all of our acquisitions are progressing and we're certainly focused on the synergy. And some of the top-line may not be there, but we're focused on the synergy. It's pretty hard to tell you right now in 2021 what that's going to be. We'll typically tell you that in the beginning of 2021 when we go through everything and understand at a granular level what actually is going to happen and what we're going to do.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Obin: Hi guys. Good morning. I'm going to try first question. So one of sort of companies that I covered today sort of took a stab at when they thought revenues were going to turn flat year-over-year. Would you guys care to guess if and when that happens?
Dave Zapico: I'm not going to guess at that.
Andrew Obin: Okay. I figured that much. You guys highlighted automation doing well. Could you talk -- are you seeing any of your customers sort of moving their supply chains around the globe? And what are the sources outside of China of automation doing well?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, that's a good question. And we are seeing that, Andrew. So supply chains are regionalizing. So there was a point of time where there was some overdependence on China. And I think a lot of companies are reconfiguring their supply chains and there's some reshoring activities going on. And that's going to help us because our process businesses help businesses manufacture things efficiently and at lower cost, and it's happening. The seeds of that are just beginning now, but that's going to be a good long-term driver for us.
Andrew Obin: And what industries do you care -- what industries are you seeing reshoring in, particularly in North America?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. It's just the beginnings. But there's definitely plans in place for a lot of companies to make their supply chains more durable. And we're seeing volume intake -- potential volume upticks in places like the U.S. and Europe for reshoring activities. But this is really on the early edges of it. And -- but it's fundamentally people want regionalized supply chains and want to reduce their dependence on parts of the world.
Andrew Obin: And then on M&A front, you sort of highlighted that you're engaged in some due diligence, some of these are smaller deals. So how do you look at your sort of firepower in terms of how much can you spend on M&A over the next couple of years? And how big a deal can you guys get to?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I mean, I look at it like we certainly can look at our free cash flow, look at our operating cash flow. It's $1 billion plus year type thing. And then we have a current liquidity of about $2.1 billion. So very clearly, our balance sheet is strong. I think Bill mentioned that it delevered during the second quarter. So in a pandemic when our top-line was down 22%, our balance sheet delevers, that's a testament. I don't know if you want to comment on that, Bill?
Bill Burke: Well, I think we certainly -- Dave, you mentioned the $2 billion, we could do more than that and still remain below our covenants. But as we've always said this is not a capital constraint strategy, this is more about finding the right businesses that will move the portfolio in the right direction and drive the returns that we're looking for. But the strength of the balance sheet can certainly support several -- couple of billion dollars worth of deals.
Andrew Obin: And more appetite for larger deals going forward?
Dave Zapico: We're looking at some larger deals. Gatan, we spent close to $1 billion on. And we have some businesses that are in our pipeline right now that are of that size.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.
Andrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys. Forgive me if I missed that. Did you -- can you comment on the price versus cost in the quarter?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. You didn't miss it. We talked about it, but we didn't give the numbers. And I'm very pleased to see our pricing held up well. Q2 was similar to Q1. We achieved about a point and a half of price across the entire business. And total inflation and the impact of tariffs was a little less than 1%. So had a good positive spread added to margins and that drove some of the margin performance in the quarter.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. And David, you've been around the blocks a few times, given you've had a few more months to kind of digest what's going on in the situation with aerospace, last quarter everything was so fresh. Do you have any updated commentary about what you're seeing, what you're hearing from customers and how you expect that market to go over the next couple of years?
Dave Zapico: It's going to take several years to get passengers back to the same volume in 2019. There's no doubt about that. And what -- the base -- our base model for aerospace assumes that there's a medical solution to the virus, whether it's a vaccine or therapeutic, and people have to be comfortable flying again, and that's going to take some time. But we're balancing our aerospace, and our military business is doing extremely well. And we're very pleased with our portfolio. It's a high quality set of businesses and our strategy is to focus on a diverse set of markets. So we think we're well positioned with our leadership positions to recover with the market and recover profitably. But that's one market that we're going to have to -- it's going to depend on the government funding, it's going to depend on capacity decisions of many airlines, it's going to depend on the confidence of the flying public. So there's still some uncertainty associated with that. So we just manage what we know. And we can resize the business. I was running our aerospace business back on 9/11. So been through a similar type of hit. And if you look at what our aerospace has done since then, we resize it and it's been a tremendous contributor to AMETEK over the time, and we're doing the same thing right now. So we have a great team in aerospace and leadership positions and many areas, excellent positions with wide boats. And we're controlling what we can control right now, but it's certainly going to be an extended recovery.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with R.W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Thanks for the questions. Dave, just to expand on your last answer there, could you just recalibrate us on maybe the percentage of the business in AMETEK that is aerospace? And also how the four businesses maybe will perform or the four segments will perform for '20?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. I mean, the aerospace presence is 15% of sales. And that's a -- 5% of that 15% is in the military market. And 10% of that 15% is in the commercial market. And that commercial market includes our OE market, it includes our business gen market, it includes our third-party aftermarket. And that's the business that we're saying is a small part of our company, about 10%. But we're saying that we're not seeing as clearly a recovery path during the second half of the year. I think we got a little better in Q2. So we call that at maybe 45% for the balance of the year. But it's pretty difficult to get too granular on that market right now, because many variables that you don't control are happening and we're just managing what we can control. In terms of the process business, we're saying we're going to grow in Q3 and Q4, and that includes our oil and gas business. In terms of power and industrial, we're saying we're going to grow in Q3 and Q4. And in terms of our automation and engineered solutions, we're going to grow in Q3 and Q4. So we think that sequential improvement that we're seeing will continue as the economy gets back to normal.
Richard Eastman: Okay, OK. And then just one question on the gross margin. Bill, the gross margin declined maybe 110 basis points, I guess, year-over-year. Could you just break that out a little bit? It sounds like you had a positive contribution from price, maybe only 30 basis points or something. But could you just give us a little bit of a walk up there or walk down on the 110?
Bill Burke: Yeah. I think the -- I think you've got the positive there in terms of price versus cost. But what you're really dealing with is just the reduction in the sales levels. You're just getting the decremental margins on the fixed costs. So I don't think there's anything more interesting.
Richard Eastman: Okay. All right. And mix here -- was mix much of an issue here between EMG? Again, I guess you favor EMG a little bit with less of a decline versus EIG? So mix was negative there.
Dave Zapico: I think the military market and the healthcare market held up well for EMG. And in EIG, we have good part of commercial aerospace, and you also have the oil and gas business.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joseph Giordano: Hey guys. Good morning. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I spoke with you last quarter from an organic standpoint was that EIG probably does a little bit better than EMG. So curious as to what kind of shifted during the quarter from a local market standpoint that would have kind of flipped that around?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Everybody here is shaking their heads. We didn't signal EIG would be better than EMG.
Joseph Giordano: Okay.
Dave Zapico: We talked about the automation business getting stronger. We talked about the military business and then commercial aerospace. Commercial aerospace was going to be weak and oil and gas is going to be weak, and those are predominantly in EIG. So it kind of paid out like we thought.
Joseph Giordano: Okay. And then on R&D side you talked about some of the advancements in some of your businesses made during the quarter, new launches. Can you just kind of talk to us about how R&D is so critical to what you guys do? And how are you guys doing it in this environment with social distancing and this? And what has had to change in order to allow R&D to progress at this stage?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, it's a great question. Great question, Joe. I've been pleasantly surprised at the quality and effectiveness, and we're getting the work done. But for R&D, it's not ideal. I mean, we have to have technicians interact with engineers and they have to find a way to get together and there is a certain spontaneity and productivity that comes with people getting together. So we're still learning. But we're using the tools and doing things safely and we're making good progress. But it's certainly an issue that we specifically have worked on and it holds us back certainly. But the digital tools are helping mitigate the problems.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the First Quarter 2020 AMETEK, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Coleman.
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. AMETEK's first quarter results were released earlier this morning and are available on market systems and in the Investors section of our website. This conference call is also being webcasted and can be accessed on our website. The webcast will be archived and made available on our site later today. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2019 or 2020 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization and excluding the pretax $141 million or $0.47 per diluted share gain from the sale of Reading Alloys in the first quarter and also a pretax $44 million or $0.15 per diluted share realignment charge taken in the first quarter. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Despite a challenging and highly uncertain economic environment due to the Covid-19 global pandemic, AMETEK delivered solid first quarter results, highlighted by excellent operating performance with earnings in line with our guidance range. I'll provide more details on the first quarter results shortly, but first I want to extend my thanks to all my AMETEK colleagues and recognize them for their amazing dedication and commitment through this difficult time. A courage and resilience I witnessed has been truly impressive. As AMETEK has been deemed an essential or life sustaining business at our operating facilities, our employees continue to provide critical solutions and services to customers across many industries including healthcare, defense, food and beverage and laboratory research.  To help safety and well-being our employee as they support these essential customers is our highest priority. We've implemented numerous safety measures aimed at providing a safe work environment. Our pandemic response plan providing a framework for our businesses to manage our facilities and workforce during this pandemic.  Among other things the plan to establishes personal and workplace hygiene practices, a global communications network of site and country pandemic coordinators, and a supply chain logistics and operations team to provide solutions to help mitigate the impact of pandemic on our business. Daily communication with local pandemic coordinators and senior management ensures we are complying with the center of disease control and local government regulations.  As part of the plan, we also implemented various safety measures including work from home requirements for those whose job allow, social distancing on our facilities and our factory floors, daily temperature monitoring of employees reporting work, use of personal protective equipment and staggered work shifts.  We remain vigilant as we return to higher level of operating activity. Now let me return to the first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.2 billion, down 6.6% from the same quarter in 2019. Recent acquisitions contributed 4%; the divesture of Reading Alloys was a two point headwind, foreign currency was one point headwind and organic sales were down 8% in the quarter. The measures we took during the quarter led to strong operating performance. While operating income decreased 3% year-over-year to $276 million. Operating margins expanded an excellent 100 basis points to 23%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating income margins expanded 110 basis points over the prior year period. Detrimental margins in the quarter were approximately 10 % shut our operating capability reflecting our ability to reduce our cost structure, as well as the strength and flexibility of our operating model. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $342 million, up 2% over the prior year with a record adjusted EBITDA mortgages of 28.5%. The operating performance led to earnings of $1.02 per diluted share, up 2% versus the comparable basis in the first quarter of 2019. And in line with our guidance range of $1.01 to $1.04. The $44 million restructuring charge we took in the quarter is expected to generate approximately $85 million in annualized structural savings. We also generate a strong cash flow in the first quarter with operating cash flow up 38% to $271 million. Free cash flow conversion was also strong at 148% of adjusted net income excluding the Reading Alloys gain.  Next, I will provide additional details at the operating group level. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $774.2 million, down 4% over last year's first quarter. The acquisitions of Gatan and IntelliPower contributed 6%. Foreign currency was a modest headwind and organic sales were down 9%. EIG's operating income in the first quarter was $194.1 million, down 4% versus the prior year. EIG operating margins were 25.1% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins expanded 20 basis points over the prior year period. The Electromechanical Group also delivered strong operating performance in the quarter despite top-line weakness as a result of the coronavirus. EMG's first quarter sales were $428 million, down 11% versus the prior year. The acquisition of PDT added 3% of the divesture of Reading Alloys was a six point headwind. Foreign currency was a one-point headwind and organic sales were down 7%. EMG's proactive cost mitigation actions led to impressive margin expansion. Our operating income was down slightly to $97.5 million in the quarter, operating margins excluding acquisitions expanded 220 basis points to a record 22.8%. During the first quarter, we also completed the acquisition of IntelliPower, a leading provider of high reliability, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems for mission-critical defense and industrial applications. Their products and solutions nicely complement our power systems and instruments businesses and they deepen our expertise and high reliability power protection applications. Annual sales for IntelliPower were approximately $40 million and we deployed $150 million on the acquisition. We also completed the divesture Reading Alloys to Kymera for $250 million. The closing of the transaction which occurred near the end of the first quarter was a positive outcome for all parties as Kymera is an outstanding strategic partner for Reading Alloys. For AMETEK, proceeds from the sales were reported on our acquisition strategy which remains our priority for capital deployment. While we are pleased with the first quarter results, the global economic environment is obviously changed since the start of the first quarter. In January, global demand was solid. In February and extended Lunar New Year holiday due to the coronavirus resulted in disruptions and China-based activity for customers and suppliers. Later in the month as China slowly reopened for business, Europe and the US and other parts of Asia started to feel the impact of the virus. At that time, we started to limit discretionary spend and non-essential travel. In addition, each of our businesses develop detailed contingency plan to prepare for a potential slowdown. In March, the impact of Covid-19 on the global economy was broadening. Many countries, states and counties started to impose travel restrictions, stay at home orders and social distancing measures for all but essential employees. Supply change delays started to emerge and customers turn cautious given the building uncertainty. Although, our facilities were operational throughout the first quarter given our essential business designation, we did see a direct impact on sales in the first quarter due to the virus. Worldwide travel restrictions limited our ability to provide support and installation services. This impacted our EIG process and power businesses most significantly in the quarter. And a broad set of customers delayed shipments.  Now a few comments on the demand environment in April. Demand in April was meaningly weaker than we experienced in March. Travel restrictions and social distancing mandates shut down all but essential activities as customers and suppliers temporary closed or implemented furloughs for all or parts of April. This has inevitably led to significant disruptions and impacts on demand. Restrictions across many geographies are slowly being loosened. However, we remain cautious on the pace of recovery. Now let me provide some comments on what we were seeing in select end markets. Although, we're seeing challenging conditions across most end markets, we're seeing solid demand continue across our healthcare, medical and defense markets, which account for approximately 20% of our sales. Our most challenged markets are commercial aerospace and oil and gas which combined account for approximately 16% of AMETEK sales. We expect meaningful weakness across these markets throughout all of 2020. In the balance of our markets including power, industrial, semiconductor research, metals and automations, we expect weak conditions in the second quarter with sequential improvements during the second half of the year. Shifting now to the actions we are taking to proactively manage our business, while ensuring we are supplying and supporting our key customers. As the spread of the virus expanded and restrictions widened in March, our business began to execute on contingency plans and implemented cost reduction actions. These contingency plans focused on maximizing cash flow, ensuring critical sources of supply and protecting key investments. All while ensuring appropriate safety measures were in place. The cost reduction actions we are taking include structural actions such as reduction enforce and facility cost consolidations, as well as temporary reductions, such as discretionary spend reductions, furloughs, temporary facility shutdowns; short time work weeks and temporary pay reductions. Given the reduction in demand we are experienced and we made a difficult decision to reduce our workforce. The total reduction of forces approximately 10% of our employee base across direct, indirect and SG&A functions. In addition, in the second quarter many of our businesses are implementing furloughs or temporary facility shutdowns. These furloughs generally range in length from one week to three weeks depending on the operating location and their customer market dynamics. The decision to furlough operations was made to have mitigated the spread of the virus, to better align our cost structure with demand and to position us to quickly respond when demand returns. The temporary pay reductions we implemented generally range between 15% and 20% for salaried employees including all AMETEK officers with a similar reduction of fees paid to our Board of Directors. As a result of these actions, we expect total cost savings in the second quarter of approximately $80 million with approximately $50 million of these savings from temporary actions and $30 million from structural actions. As we proceed into the second half of the year, we expect the benefit from our structural cost actions to ramp up with full year structural savings started at approximately $125 million. We will flex our temporary cost savings either up or down in the third and fourth quarters based on volume levels. In addition to these cost savings initiatives, we also reduced our capital expenditures by over 25% from our initial plans in the year, with full year CapEx now expected to be roughly $75 million. Before I provide commentary on our outlook for the quarter, I want to highlight the work AMETEK is doing where we operate to assist in the fight against Covid-19. Through the Ametek Foundation, we have made more than $1.5 million in contributions to charitable organizations many of whom are providing food and essential items to those in need, along with personal protective equipment to the men and women on the frontlines of this pandemic. We are proud to partner with numerous organizations around the world where we have an operating presence to support the immense humanitarian crisis caused by the pandemic. I also wanted to highlight a few of Ametek businesses are involved in the fight against Covid-19. AMETEK Roland, a leading provider of mission-critical communication and workflow solutions used in hospitals and other healthcare facilities has developed the Roland Rapid Response kit. This solution allows nurses and healthcare providers to quickly triage patients, gather necessary supplies and determine the appropriate clinical response all while keeping a safe distance to minimize repetitive staff to patient contact. They are being deployed for use in temporary medical facilities and new patient care facilities within hospitals to meet the surge of additional patients. Ametek Land is another great example. Land is a leading manufacturer of monitors and analyzers for industrial infrared, non-contact temperature measurement. In March, they released their virulence solution, a temperature screening thermal imaging system designed for highly accurate human body temperature measurement. This technology can be utilized for screening at point of entry into key facilities such as offices, factories, schools, government buildings and transportation hubs. They are seeing strong initial interest for the solution is temperature screening at this scale will play a fundamental role in helping to contain the spread of the Covid-19 and along with return to our normal daily lives.  AMETEK's Powervar business is providing customized, uninterruptible power systems to a number of leading medical device diagnostic equipment providers' use for coronavirus testing. These UPS systems are being deployed worldwide. And lastly, AMETEK Advanced Motion Solutions is providing critical solutions to manufacturers of ventilators and laboratory diagnostic equipment used in the Covid-19 response. These are just a few examples of the critical roles our businesses are playing and combating this global crisis. We are proud to be part of the solution and committed to supporting our customers in these efforts. As we previously announced due to the uncertainty is presented by the Covid-19 global pandemic, we have withdrawn our full-year guidance and will not be issuing quarterly guidance at this time. We will issue guidance as condition stabilizes and visibility improves. However, I did want to provide some level of comments about the second quarter and the balance of the year, given what we know now. First, we expect that the quarter will be the low point in sales in earnings this year given broad-based uncertainty and the impact on global demand from stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions. Second, we expect sequential improvements in sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters as the economy slowly reopens. And third, we expect to manage full-year decremental margins in the 25% to 30% range. While the second quarter decremental is being between 30% and 35%. To summarize, AMETEK delivered solid results on the first quarter on strong execution through unprecedented market dynamics. Bill will speak to this in a moment, but the actions we took in the first quarter strengthen our already strong balance sheet and liquidity. And we are poised to emerge from this economic crisis in a strong financial position, which will allow us to continue to deploy capital and acquisitions and invest in our growth initiatives. We are confident in the future of AMETEK as our world-class talent and the adaptability of the AMETEK growth model will continue to drive long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders. The message we've given to our employees is simply, while these are truly unprecedented times, AMETEK has faced challenging and uncertain environments before. And each time the collective strengths and talents of all AMETEK colleagues have allowed us to emerge stronger and better position. Together, we're working to make sure AMETEK again emerge stronger and better position for the next chapter of our growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. I would also like to thank our colleagues around the world for their tremendous efforts over the past few months. We have asked a lot of our colleagues as we manage the impact of Covid-19 on our business. And as always, they have risen to the challenge. The actions our businesses took in the first quarter helped us deliver strong operating performance and improved our already strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Let me provide some financial highlights for the quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were down $3 million compared to the same period in 2019 due largely to lower compensation costs. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales versus last year's level of 1.4% of sales. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.4% down from last year's first quarter tax rate of 20.5% with this lower rate in the quarter being due to tax planning initiatives. For 2020, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21% and as we've stated in the past actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Operating working capital in the quarter was 18.9% versus 18.2% in the first quarter of 2019. Capital expenditures were $17 million for the first quarter. As Dave indicated, we now expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million, down from our initial expectations of a $100 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $66 million. For the full year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $255 million, which includes after-tax acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $120 million or $0.52 per diluted share. Operating cash flow in the quarter was outstanding at $271 million, up 38% over 2019's first quarter. Free cash flow was $254 million, up 45% over the prior year period and free cash flow conversion adjusted for the Reading gain was excellent at 148%. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $3.25 billion, up from $2.77 billion at the end of 2019. During the first quarter, we drew down $500 million from our revolver to bolster our liquidity position. We also deployed approximately $115 million on the acquisition of IntelliPower during the quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $1.25 billion, which includes the proceeds from the sale of Reading Alloys and the draw down on the revolver. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.2x as we were intentionally holding higher than normal cash balances. This ratio was comfortably below our debt covenants of 3.5x. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4x at the end of the quarter. AMETEK is extremely well positioned to manage this economic downturn. We have more than $1.8 billion in liquidity to support our operations and growth initiatives, including $550 million in available revolver capacity. We have a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2023.  To conclude, our businesses delivered a solid quarter despite extraordinary challenges due to Covid-19. Our world-class workforce, the strong cash generation of our niche businesses and our balance sheet strength position us well to manage this downturn and will position us well to invest in our growth strategies over the long term. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Andrew could we please open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
JoshuaPokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're well. If you wouldn't mind just talking a little bit about April or maybe March exit rates just give us a sense for what you're seeing out there. I appreciate all the color on decrementals and then certainly how margins held up in the first quarter. But maybe give us a sense for demand cadence, I know a few weeks maybe isn't a trend at this point but just to kind of calibrate where we're at on that first.
DaveZapico: Sure. Josh. So there'll be a substantial revenue drop in April. We were down about 25% in April. And as we look ahead to the quarter we can be down about 25% or a bit more or a bit less because we have limited availability. But I pointed to that 25% that we actually were down in April.
JoshuaPokrzywinski: Got it. That's really helpful. I appreciate, Dave. And I guess on the other side of this understanding that some of these countermeasures on the cost side end up being temporary and some are a little bit more permanent in nature. Anything that would prevent kind of a normal incremental margin on the other side i.e. are you pulling on the temporary levers such that you do need to kind of reflect the cost base or compensation metrics et cetera, when we do finally recover it. It doesn't look like the case but you just want to make sure that that's the way you're thinking about it.
DaveZapico: Yes. That's a good question and that's why there's a balance of structural and temporary cost reductions. I mean we, historically, when AMETEK recover out of these downturns we've been had very high contribution margins and I would expect the same thing to occur this time. But we're using our best judgment and our experience with these businesses to balance the structural cost reductions with the temporary. So we have going to have $80 million in cost savings in Q2 about $30 million of that is structural and about $50 million of that's temporary. And then as we go through the course we'll increase or decrease that temporary cost reductions based on demand. And if it looks like demand is not materializing, it doesn't do any good to leave around the excess and unutilized resources. So we have the capability to do more, but we have a good feel for these businesses and we want to get through this thing with our businesses impact intact.  At the same time focus on the decrementals as we get through that. And I would expect that we would have very good incrementals as when we ultimately get through the crisis and we recover.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
DeaneDray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just to clarify the down 25% in April was that an organic revenue growth? And how did orders shake out?
DaveZapico: Orders and sales are about the same. Orders were about that 25 point level; sales were just a bit more and that's really on the total orders and sales.
DeaneDray: Good. And, Dave, can you talk about visibility? I mean part of the AMETEK business model is you've got healthy recurring revenues around 30%. So how do you think those hold up and just kind of connect us what we're seeing in terms of customer behavior, push outs, cancellations and so forth.
DaveZapico: Yes. Sure. That's a good question, Deane. I mean when I think about Q1 or the end of Q1, we left probably $40 million or $50 million, four or five points of organic growth. We could not ship because our customers weren't available to take delivery or we cannot travel to the site to do the installation and commissioning work. So it's -- that was a big deal for us and we have to get to places in China and around the world and in the US especially in our process and power businesses. And do that commissioning and get that recurring revenue. So part of the customer behavior part for your question is that they delayed shipments. And we weren't able to access them and part of the recurring revenue is, it's driven by the ability to service them. So I think the recurring revenues will hold up relatively well, may be except in the aerospace business but we have to be able to travel and get to our customers and had to return some normalcy there for that to happen.
DeaneDray: That's real helpful and appreciates all the color on the decrementals because that's absolutely within the band that we'd expect based upon the cost outs that you've taken. So I kind of feel like we can ask a more forward-looking question regarding when and how can you pivot to playing offense. You've got just an exceptionally strong balance sheet. We know M&A markets need to settle down, but what's expectation in terms of line of sight on potential acquisitions at the stage or is it just too early.
DaveZapico: I think it's a great question, Deane, because we feel we're going to emerge from this crisis with an excellent M&A opportunity. It's going to remain our first priority for capital allocation. Bill already went through the strong balance sheet, the cash flow generating capabilities of companies and we had a very strong pipeline going into this crisis. We closed on an IntelliPower in Q1. We were very close on another deal, a very nice business we had just felt we could not finalize our diligence and integrate it with the restrictions caused by the virus. Certainly, it's a potential to continue with that deal post crisis because we really like it. And we have a good relationship with the sellers. And we're going to keep developing our pipeline. We have multiple tangible opportunities for post crisis. I mean a great pipeline going into this and we're going to use our business development team to maintain those relationships. In terms of the current environment, buyers and sellers are focused differently what challenges they have in their business. New set of buyers. There's a new set of buyer price expectations that need to get aligned with seller expectations. You don't have the ability to perform face-to-face diligence to negotiate to integrate it. So I think it's going to be late 2020 maybe the fourth quarter of 2020 before the market begins returning to normal. But I think we're well positioned to really capitalize on the opportunity there. And that's the way we're thinking about this thing. We're going to preserve our balance sheet now make sure it's strong and we're going to see a bigger opportunity and we get out of this.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett. 
IvanaDelevska: Good morning. So just wanted to ask as we emerge from this what percent of your businesses do you think could kind of more quickly come back versus what could take longer time to get back to normal?
DaveZapico: Yes. That's a good question, Ivana. And it's really -- it's both end market and the time of -- and the type of business that we're talking about. As I mentioned earlier, we serve a range of different end markets and some of these markets are seeing solid demand. These include medical wealth care, defense businesses and some markets are very challenged and oil and gas and aerospace. So I think the oil and gas and aerospace businesses are going to be the last to pick up positively; probably oil and gas will pick up well before aerospace, but the aerospace downturn we could have a couple two or three years but the majority of our businesses I think are going to recover quite well from this. And we have higher incremental margins and we're managing the decremental is on the way down. So I'm pretty optimistic that we'll be able to -- we were able to expand the last three years to 2019, we grew organically 5% a year greater than industrial production. And we got great margin expansion and in the environment that we're going to have in the second half of the year and into 2021 you may be an environment we're growing a little bit faster than that. So I expect our businesses to respond and our businesses to have better margins on the way out and with the exception that aerospace and oil and gas could be down for a while.
IvanaDelevska: Okay. And in terms of mix in terms of marginal impacts of those businesses kind of underperforming. Would it be a positive for margins?
DaveZapico: Yes. I think it'll be a positive for margins on the way down our aerospace is a pretty profitable business. It's a couple of points more profitable than the base business and our oil and gas is about at the base business profitability. We had 20% EBITDA in the first quarter so. But I think if you go back and look at the prior downturns and AMETEK recovered from them. We've always had healthy contribution margins on the way out because we're such a profitable business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt Securities.
ScottGraham: Hey. Good morning Dave, Bill, Kevin. Hey, so I hope you can help me with a couple of questions on the cost save. So we came into the year with about $90 million of them sort of based productivity as I call it. And I think I heard you say that the restructuring charges are going to give us $85 million in savings. Do we add those numbers together?
DaveZapico: No. Well, you are actually doing an annualized basis. The $85 million is on an annualized basis. So when I think about the second half of the year we talked about $30 million maybe $30 million in structural safe savings in Q3 combined with about $50 million of variable when we get to the second half of the year Q3 and Q4 and we have about $75 million of structural savings right across those two quarters. So the structural savings will ramp up and if it plays out like we think the temporary savings will ramp down. And we'll exit 2021 with a pretty healthy level cost reductions on a run rate basis going into 2021.
ScottGraham: And -- right so the 2021 carryover on structural, what would that be?
DaveZapico: It's going to depend on some things, but I think it will be about $40 million.
ScottGraham: Got it. and if you could just maybe help us understand on the cadence of sales in aerospace, commercial aerospace and oil and gas, certainly we understand that they’re worse, perhaps a lot worse than the April sales number, but is there any kind of parameter you can throw around those numbers to help us understand what the real deltas are?
DaveZapico: Yes. I'll give you an idea with aerospace and, again, there’s a caveat that we don’t have good visibility. But our commercial aerospace business is up 10% of the company, that includes our OE and after market that can be down 50%, and the after-market part of it can be down more, the OE part of it down a little less, but that markets going drop, it’s going to be pretty significant and we’re seeing that happen. So, that’s just a fact for a considerable amount of time.
ScottGraham: Yes. And the oil and gas?
DaveZapico: Oil and gas is going to have a tough time, I think the recovery is going to be faster because it’s going to be more based on a commodity price and it’s not going to be as long term, it’s going to be people start driving their cars again. It’s going to be, you know, definitely less than 50% for the year, but I’d put it in the 25% range or something like that, more so in the upstream than the downstream. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
NigelCoe: Thanks. Good morning, gents. So just going back to the decremental margins, obviously, very impressive management of those. So before the discretionary cost savings, what kind of gross decremental margin are we looking at here? Is it sort of 45% type numbers? And are you confident that there’s enough discretionary cost you can go after to manage decrementals into those ranges within a reasonable revenue range?
DaveZapico: Yes, it’s an excellent question, Nigel. And if you think about this kind of environment, you’re going to end up with the decremental margins of – if we did nothing, we’d be in that 50%, 55%, some businesses at 60% range. So what we’re doing is we’re mitigating that greater-than-50% decremental margin in this kind of environment, and we have a higher margin business. And the costs that we’re taking out are getting us to the 25% to 30% decrementals for the year.
NigelCoe: Okay. But what you’re saying is there’s enough discretionary cost in the short-term to comfortably manage in that range? There’s no breakpoints that you see right now.
DaveZapico: Yes, I don’t see – it’s going to be difficult, and we didn’t give guidance, but we’re pretty good at managing the decrementals and that’s our focus right now. We’re going month to month, and our operating operations are making adjustments on the level of capacity and the level of customer demands. And I think that we can manage to that 25% to 30% level for the year.
NigelCoe:  Great. And then my follow-up question is one of the keys to success for AMETEK in the past has been the right incentives at the divisional level. Some for growth, some for margin, cash flow, et cetera. Given the lack of visibility right now, how have you changed the incentive structure for your divisional managers?
DaveZapico: We haven’t changed them as of yet. They’re still based on the original targets that were set for the year. And we’re – we are managing through this thing. And I personally – everybody is going to feel some pain through this process, and resetting targets to the existing level of our business isn’t fair for everyone, including our shareholders. So it’s going to be a tough year, and there’s going to be less variable compensation. That opportunity is still there, but it’s not going to materialize. And that’s just the way it is. And I’ll talk to my Comp Committee about the appropriate things in these areas. But in general, there’s going to be lower variable payments from our incentive systems this year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.
BrettLinzey: Hey. Good morning, guys. Hey. Just wanted to come back to the comments on the medical health care and defense bucket at 20%. Were you suggesting in April that was actually a positive in terms of sales and orders? And then how are you thinking about that for the year?
DaveZapico: Yes, I think the defense, the medical, the health care are going to be positive for the year. And in April, they didn’t decline as much. So that’s how we’re thinking about it. That piece of our business at this point seems to feel pretty solid. The thing that we – it was very encouraging in Q1, we bought Gatan. We have a couple of quarter with Gatan; it’s still above its acquisition model. So they’re doing a great job for us. And some of our recent acquisitions like Rauland in the health care space, MOCON in the food space, and Telular in the IoT space, these are three pretty sizable deals we did over the last couple years. All three of those businesses in Q1 had double digit orders growth. So we’re expecting those kinds of businesses to hold up pretty well. We’re not sure if it’s going to be plus or minus, but it’s certainly not going to be the – they did not see that kind of decline in the quarter. We’re not – they’re not going to see that decline in the quarter.
BrettLinzey: Okay. Great. And then just shifting to free cash flow. Very solid start to the year. What is the expectation as we go forward here? I mean, should we assume that the working capital should get a lift as the business cycles down? And maybe just a little bit of a framework on conversion or maybe a range you’re thinking about for the year.
DaveZapico: Yes, I think in the second quarter, you’d expect a working capital lift as you have both impacted the lower sales level. But then some of that will get added back given the sequential increases in sales that we’re expecting. I think overall a good place to be would be north of 120% of free cash flow conversion to net income.
BrettLinzey: Okay. Great.
DaveZapico: For the year. For the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens.
RobertMcCarthy: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess the first question is a little bit to amplify your comments around the realignment charges you took. I guess this is consistent with kind of your practice periodically. I think the last time you did this was kind of in the 2016 time frame with the oil and gas retrenchment. You talked about a payback I think of 2x or something along those lines. But could you talk about that in terms of what you’re expecting for the run rate savings again? And then just in that context, where are you taking out the most capacity? Is it presumably aerospace? Is it presumably these businesses that seem to be a little more longer cycle and structurally challenged and obviously are in the news because you see a lot of capacity being taken out across the complex?
DaveZapico: Right. That’s a great question, Rob. We attempted to balance these permanent cost reductions in area where demand has been more impacted. So, as an example, in the commercial aerospace market, we had about a 20% headcount reduction, and we had a little bit more than our average in the oil and gas business. Then we used a temporary approach in other areas to be positioned to respond quickly when demand recovers. And when we think about the structural savings, that was about $30 million in Q2, and that will increase sequentially as we go through the year. And then we’ll exit the year – it was a question answered earlier – with about a $40 million benefit to 2021. But we’ll see increased structural savings in Q3 and then in Q4. And we’ll take our temporary savings and adjust that based on volume. But we felt it was necessary for the permanent reductions. It’s very a difficult decision, but where demand is most impacted, not short term but more long term, we took those actions.
RobertMcCarthy: Yes, and just for pedagogical purposes, presumably that’s all baked into the decrementals you already highlighted?
DaveZapico: That’s all baked into the decrementals, correct.
RobertMcCarthy: Yes, okay. Of course. All right. And then the second question is, obviously, I think you answered Deane’s question very well about M&A and the opportunity set. But you are sitting on a lot of cash. It is a very difficult environment for potential share repurchase. You have done share repurchase in the past. I think notably in the fourth quarter of 2018 you thought it was particularly prudent, given the intrinsic value of your company. Well, if memory serves. But how do you think about share repurchase in this environment? Or perhaps you don’t have as much visibility. And then, obviously, you have the whole populism problem with share repurchase as a whole in terms of a use of capital allocation. How do you think about it – because you do have a sizable cash balance? And even despite what we’re going to see right now, still a strong prospect for continued cash generation here.
DaveZapico: Yes, the first point is our priority is M&A. So we want to be able to execute on those M&A opportunities as we clear the crisis. And we have been opportunistic with buybacks, and we have the capacity to do buybacks. So that’s something we’ll consider. And our third priority, we’ll maintain the consistent dividend that we pay. But right now with the situation being so uncertain, we have built some extra cash. We have the liquidity, and we’re going to make sure our balance sheet is strong as we get through this crisis. And if there is an opportunity to do buybacks, that’s something we’ll consider. But clearly, capital allocations number one priority is acquisitions. And right now we’re just making sure we get through this thing with a healthy, strong balance sheet and a strong company.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.
RichardEastman: Yes. Good morning. Dave, could you just speak to – I’m curious a little bit here as we move forward into the second quarter and into the back half of the year, when I look at EIG and that segment of the business, it does I think – oil and gas shows up in there. Could you just talk a little bit more about some of the process industries, the process instruments, how they’re holding together? And then also the large commercial business, I think, falls largely in EIG. So does that suggest that EIG is weaker than EMG as we track through the balance of the year?
DaveZapico: No. The way you think about first our aerospace businesses are, Rick, it’s predominantly in EMG. So that’s going to be a headwind to EMG. But on the EMG side, I think our automation business has been through a lot of – it was the first business that went in. And we’re already starting to see some improvements out of China for automation business. So our automation business could be the first part of the business that does well and recovers. It could be. When you think about EIG, your question about process is a good one, because process serves a wide range of end markets, which are experiencing different dynamics, different end market dynamics.  On the positive side we’re seeing solid demand in our medical, health care, and high-end research businesses within that segment. And that segment includes Roland and MOCON and Telular and Demand. And I’ve already commented on these businesses and their growth drivers. Conversely, it’s the part of our business that has oil and gas, which counts overall to about 6% of AMETEK sales. And we’re going to be challenged in that part of it until the oil prices recover because there’s supply and demand imbalance .And while we expect process sales to improve sequentially in the second half of the year, we expect the oil and gas component of it to remain challenged because of the sizable cuts to the capital budgets and the supply and demand imbalances.
RichardEastman: Okay. Okay. And then just a quick question. Just a couple thoughts, if you will, about geographies here in the quarter. And maybe do we see the same type of cadence out of Asia, China? Do we see some recovery late in March – modest recovery? Just maybe the cadence around the geographies here as we exited first quarter and into the second.
DaveZapico: Sure, Rick. I mean, the headline on the geography story is those are broad-based weaknesses in our geographies with Europe and Asia most challenged. And when you think about it, Asia was down high teens. And it was China was down first; it was driven by travel restrictions, the inability to install and commission our products. It was China, Japan, Korea. And then we look at China specifically. As you got to the end of the quarter, it started to recover. And it’s recovering and improving, but it’s not completely back. Our facilities over there are operating with pretty much full capacity now, and we’ve got our supply base up and running. But we very recently started traveling to most customer sites. We weren’t allowed to travel and do installation and do service work. I’ll give an example. In the research end markets, there are some universities that still haven’t opened back up yet. And we have some equipment waiting to be installed there. So in China, I would say it’s improving, but it’s definitely not the whole way back. And then when we think about Europe and it was down low double digits and same kind of drivers. The biggest impact was on our Dunkermotoren business and our process businesses in Europe. And then when we got to the U.S., the U.S. in the first quarter was down about 3% due to the same customer delays and delays, inability to commission product. So it feels like we’re kind of coming out of it in the opposite way that it surfaced. So Asia feels like China is recovering a bit. And it seems like the U.S. may be still heading in a bit, and Europe might be at the bottom right now. So it was broad-based weakness. Europe and Asia were most challenged.
RichardEastman: Understood. And just maybe a last question for me, sorry. When you look at the overall business and the type of downturns here that we’re seeing in demand that has historically not had much impact on your pricing. Is that correct?
DaveZapico: Yes, it’s a great question. I mean, this environment is different. So we’re going to have to see. But I expect that we’re going to be able to achieve this same level of price. We did in Q1. Q1 2020 pricing was good. We got 1.5% of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs was about 1%. So we had a 50-basis point positive spread adding to our margin expansion, and I expect that’s going to continue for the year, but we’re in an environment now where you really don’t know what the fluctuating demand pattern is.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
AndrewObin: Yes. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Thank you for providing more information and great execution. Just in terms of your supply chain in Asia and just globally, how has it – how is it holding up with all the shutdowns in places like India and Malaysia? I’m not sure what’s happening in Indonesia. And how are you rethinking your supply chain for the post-COVID-19 world?
DaveZapico: Yes, good question. I mean, our philosophy is to always supply in the region where the demand is and we were moving to that even before the tariffs started and even now with COVID, we think that makes sense. We want to build where the demand is. So that will give us regional thought process around there. You mentioned Malaysia. Malaysia was one of the areas where we had some difficulty in the first quarter. I mean, the government came in and told us we couldn’t operate and that was the only place in the world that happened. And we couldn’t operate for a period of time and then we got authorization to operate at 25%, and then authorization to go to 50% and eventually right now we’re at about 100%.  So it’s – the different governments around the world responded differently and we have a really good supply chain team, and they’re out battling with all these problems and getting them solved and they did a good job solving that one. So what we see across the world is – I’ll give Mexico as an example. We have suppliers in Mexico. And Mexico is a little bit later to recognize the coronavirus threat, and then the government jumped in and started to do all the same things that were done around the rest of the world. But they seemed to implement it with the local authorities having different levels of judgment in what was essential and what was not essential. So we spent a lot of time and our supply chain team did a great job during the quarter getting suppliers turned on to Mexico when the local authorities had to tell them to shut them down.  And that involved us going to the authorities, telling them why they were essential as a supplier, and we got those all working. So it’s been a really, really difficult time for our supply base, and our people have done just a fantastic job in managing it, and we’ll expect there will be continuing problems like that during the second quarter and as we go through this thing and we have localized problems and outbreaks that we have to deal with, and we’ve got good management, and they know how to deal with these things and we’re dealing with them. But at the same time, it creates enough of a visibility issue that that’s why we went through our guidance.
AndrewObin: And just another question on China. You did sort of say that China is getting better. What kind of lessons, because I think people are trying to figure out what lessons this China holds for the shape of recovery in Europe and the U.S.? We’ve heard from some companies; I think Parker or Honeywell sort of seem to have said that March was this big spur of demand coming back. But then April is a little bit slower because the economy is now back to normal, so maybe it’s not all the way straight up. Can you just give more color on what’s happening in China, April versus March relative and absolute terms? And as I said, more importantly, what lessons do you think this recovery holds for Europe and the U.S.? Thank you very much.
DaveZapico: Yes, I think the lessons for Europe and the U.S. is you have to follow the social distancing mandates that the governments are putting through, and you will recover. And when you recover, it’s not going to be across China. It was a choppy recovery with different regions having different requirements on travel. And I think we’re going to have the same things here. So in terms of China specifically, as I said before, it’s recovering, but it’s not completely back. So our plants are now operating near 100% of capacity, but what’s causing us a bit of the difficulty now is being able to travel to the customer sites and do service work and do install work. And just recently that started to open up. Just very recently.  I think last week we started traveling in places like Beijing and things to do service work. So I think you learn from that. I mean, we learned from China. It was interesting to watch within the company. Our operating people did a fantastic job in China managing through this, the COVID-19 problem. And we have essential customers in China, and we were probably one of the few plants that were still operating there, serving the medical customers in China. But they kind of set a work plan for us of using temperature monitoring and PPE and thinking about how to relay out production lines and how to relay out factory floors and talking about the flows of people within the buildings and how you quarantine someone within the building. And we learned from that as a company. So we learned from that. We helped in developing in China, and we saw how it worked and what didn’t work. And now that’s informing our decisions in Europe and the U.S. So it’s – and we learn something new every day, and something changes every day. So I don’t know if...
AndrewObin: But just to follow up, is China up sequentially in April versus March? And thank you so much for answering my questions.
DaveZapico: Yes, China is up in April, but in March, it was very diminished. And it just picked up at the end.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.
AndrewBuscaglia: Hi, guys. I wanted to dig in to Aerospace just a little bit more. So obviously, the outlook, weak for that area long-term or longer term. But can you talk about that business, how you guys think about it and where there’s exposure? And I’m talking about where are you exposed to production versus miles flown. And what do you need to see come back within your businesses the most for that market to recover?
DaveZapico: Right. That’s an excellent question, Andrew. And as a reminder, AMETEK has a balanced exposure across our Aerospace and Defense markets. So our total exposure is about 15% of sales. 15% of AMETEK is in Aerospace, with roughly 5% to Defense. So we’re seeing that Defense is still strong, and we expect that to continue for the balance of the year. 5% of the 15% is in Commercial and Business Jet OEM, and 5% is in the Aftermarket. So that 5% in Commercial and Business Jet OEM and the 5% in the Aftermarket, that’s a roughly 10% exposure to Commercial OEM and Aftermarket that we think is going to be very challenged. And when I was talking about the potential to be down 50% and the potential that the Aftermarket is down more and the OE is maybe 50% or a little less, that’s really what I was talking about. And in terms of our exposures, we have broad exposures across essentially all key aerospace and defense platforms. And we have a great business. I mean, we have leadership positions in aerospace power generation. We kind of revolutionized the way power is distributed around an aircraft. We’re winning lots of business there. We have an excellent business in advanced sensors, airframes and engines and all parts of aircrafts. And we have an excellent thermal management business that handles heating and cooling of aircraft on very difficult applications. So the fundamental businesses that we have in that space are just great businesses. And they’re going to go through a tough time, and the Aerospace market is going to look different, but we have really good management there. And as I said, we’re adjusting to it now.
AndrewBuscaglia: Yes, I mean, it sounds like you’re generally still positive on that business over the long term and that – my next question was going to be, what’s going on to discourage you from acquiring in that space and building that business more? Or not? It seems like the latter.
DaveZapico: Yes, I think the way that we think about it is we want balanced end-market exposures. And right now we’re dealing with a lot in that business as we decrease. But we really like the business. We have really sustainable businesses there, with wide moats around the business. They’re good businesses. They’re essential. And those businesses are going to be fine. So there’s going to be an adjustment in volume, where you reset the cost structure. But when those businesses start growing, they’re going to grow with healthy incremental margins. So we still feel good about it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.
JoeGiordano: Hey, guys. Good morning. Hey. I think you touched most of the operational stuff already. So Dave, I just want like a bigger picture. I mean when you stepped into the role, it was like maybe the worst possible situation in terms of timing. So what can you kind of – what did you learn managing that initially through an energy crisis and how your businesses were impacted? I mean, I know that that’s all smaller as a percentage of sales, and you just sold Reading, so it’s different portfolio, but what were some of the critical lessons you learned then and how you applying that now?
DaveZapico: Yes, it’s a great question. And I just come back to the seasoned management team that we have at AMETEK. I mean all of my executive office, they have been through many downturns, and they know what to do. We know what to do. And a big part of our – because we have such good culture and we have such long-term employees, they realize we’re going to get through this. And the new people in our business are learning from them, and we’re getting through this. And Bill and I, we’ve changed our management cadence. And in March, we had operating meetings with every one of our business units. And we’re going to do that again probably – I think it starts next week when we get through this call. And we’re – it’s changing the cadence, and through those meetings we understand what’s going on with the business. We make sure we’re focused on cash flow. We are making sure of right things for our customer base and we’ll learn from that. So – and we understand what’s going on in the business. But I think the biggest thing when you step back and you think about this thing long-term, we’re very well positioned. We have proven management capability to manage through this downturn. Our businesses are well positioned with leadership positions, high barriers to entry, strong technology positions, the quintessential essential business, and we’re executing very well, generating excellent cash flow as evidenced by the first quarter, as evidenced by the past few years. We got the question earlier, we have a proven capability to get price and offset inflation with price. We have that capital deployment strategy. World-class acquisition products. So there’s no doubt in my mind we’re going to get through this and we’re going to be stronger for it. But it all comes back to the people, and we have the experience to get it done.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
KenNewman: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Ken Newman on for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Hope you guys are healthy. I just want to circle back to your – thank you very much. Just want to circle back on your comments around aero. Obviously, I know the environment is very challenging right now. But just trying to think about your 2Q trough comments and maybe any color that you’ve been having on the conversations that you’ve been having with your customers there in terms of the cadence for volumes in the back half as some of these facilities, especially for Boeing are starting to start back up. Curious if you would expect to feel the pull from the facilities as soon as they start up? Or do you think they have enough inventories to start initially and then they would come back to you once that normalizes?
DaveZapico: Yes, I think it’s a mix, Ken, because there’s going to be – you think about a production line. There’s going to be some things they need right away and there’s going to be some excess inventory. So it’s a mix of things. And as I said before, what we’re seeing and what we saw in April is that business is challenged, substantially challenged. So that it’s going to take a while for that business to adapt to those customer bases to the new demand. And the fact that we have balance in our aerospace business and we have 5% of it in defense of the 15%, it really helps us because we have some solid demand there so. But we’ll definitely recover as the business recovers but it’s going to take some time. And quite honestly, all those customers haven’t even decided what the new build rates are going to be. So they’re just deciding that now and those conversations are going on.
KenNewman: Got it. No, that’s helpful. And then just one more for me, bigger picture. I’m just curious about your conversations with customers around the automation solutions that you guys provide. Do you think customers may be looking more towards automation after having to deal with first, tariffs and now the pandemic? Just how are you thinking about that market as we kind of progress through this down cycle and maybe looking towards the other side?
DaveZapico: Yes, I mean, the automation business has an excellent opportunity because if you want to eliminate – in the era of social distancing, that’s going to drive demand for automation. So it’s a demand driver on the exit of this that wasn’t there before we went in. And again, in our automation business, that was weaker in 2019. We started to see that business normalize run rate later in the first quarter, particularly in China. So pretty positive on our automation business, and we were always positive on it because there’s long-term demand drivers. And right now, our automation business is spending time along in the medical world providing automation systems for some of these testing devices for coronavirus where they have to test multiple samples. So they’re using more automation equipment to do that. So we’re positive on it, and that business is going to do well going forward.
KenNewman: And just one quick follow-up to that is do those automation markets typically have – are those considered margin accretive to the base business?
DaveZapico: Yes, I think it’s margin accretive to EMG, for sure.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions at this time. So with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Andrew, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the webcast can be accessed on our website in the Investor section. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect.

David Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered excellent performance in the fourth quarter, capping another year with exceptional results, highlighted by strong sales growth, outstanding operating performance and robust capital deployment on strategic acquisitions. In 2019, we achieved records for essentially all key financial metrics, including sales, EBITDA, operating income, earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. As a result of this strong cash flow and consistent cash flow, we successfully deployed $1.1 billion on 2 strategic acquisitions. These excellent results are driven by the AMETEK Growth Model and the efforts of our talented employees worldwide. AMETEK is committed to our mission of solving our customers' most complex challenges with differentiated technology solutions and delivering long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders. Now on to the details of the fourth quarter results. Sales in the quarter were a record $1.3 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2018. Recent acquisitions contributed 5%. Organic sales were down 1.5%, and currency was a 0.5 point headwind. Fourth quarter operating income increased 6% to $298 million. Reported operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 22.8%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating income margins expanded an outstanding 90 basis points over the prior year. EBITDA was a record $354 million in the quarter, up 7% over 2018 fourth quarter. Earnings for the fourth quarter increased 13% to $1.08 per diluted share, outperforming our guidance range of $1.01 to $1.03. Our businesses also generated a record $342 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, a 16% increase over last year's fourth quarter. This led to a superb cash conversion ratio of 137% for the quarter. Now on to the fourth quarter details for our operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered strong operating performance with solid sales growth and margin execution. EIG's fourth quarter sales were a record $880 million, up 7% year-on-year driven by contributions from recent acquisitions. Organic sales and currency were both flat in the quarter. EIG continues to drive meaningful efficiency and productivity improvements through our operational excellence initiatives. These efforts led to another quarter of strong operating performance. EIG's operating income in the quarter was a record $230 million, a 7% increase over the same quarter in 2018. Reported operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 26.1%. Excluding acquisitions, operating margins expanded 60 basis points. The Electromechanical Group also delivered a solid quarter with strong operating performance. EMG sales were $425 million in the quarter, down 5% versus prior year, with organic sales down 4% and currency a 1 point headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by continued softness across our automation markets. Despite the softness, the EMG group responded with solid operating performance. Operating income in the quarter was $85 million with reported operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 19.9%. Excluding acquisitions, operating margin increased 70 basis points over the prior year period. Now for the full year results. 2019 was an exceptional year for AMETEK with record results. Overall sales were up 6.5% to $5.2 billion. Full year operating income was $1.2 billion, increasing 9% over the prior year, and reported margins were up 60 basis points to 22.8%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins expanded an impressive 100 basis points over 2018. EBITDA for the year was a record $1.4 billion, up 10% over 2018 and 26.9% of sales. This led to outstanding profit growth with earnings per diluted share of $4.19, an increase of 14% over last year's comparable basis and well above our initial 2019 guidance range of $3.95 to $4.05. I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for their exceptional efforts during the quarter and throughout the entire year. Before I discuss our 2020 outlook, I wanted to touch on some of the highlights from 2019 that relate to the AMETEK Growth Model. I'll begin with acquisitions. We had another exciting year on the acquisition front, deploying nearly $1.1 billion on 2 highly strategic acquisitions: Pacific Design Technologies and Gatan. This follows an equally strong 2018 where we also deployed $1.1 billion on acquisitions. And we're off to a good start in 2020, announcing the acquisition of IntelliPower this morning. IntelliPower is a leading provider of high-reliability, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems for mission-critical defense and industrial applications. IntelliPower is a leader in the niche markets given their unique technology and expertise. Their products and solutions perfectly complement our power systems and instruments businesses and deepen our expertise in high reliability power protection applications. Annual sales for IntelliPower are approximately $40 million, and we deployed $115 million on the acquisition. We remain very confident on our ability to identify, acquire and integrate excellent businesses into AMETEK. Our acquisition process, from deal sourcing to due diligence to integration, is a core competency at AMETEK. Our pipeline remains strong, and we look forward to another excellent year. In addition to these acquisitions, we made the strategic decision to divest our Reading Alloys business as part of our portfolio review process. We entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business to Kymera International in an all-cash transaction valued at $250 million. This transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. As a leading provider of highly engineered materials, Reading Alloys experienced solid growth in sales and profitability since being acquired by AMETEK in 2008. As we continue to evolve our portfolio to high-end, differentiated technology solutions with less cyclicality, we thought it was appropriate to explore options for the business. In the end, we believe this is an excellent outcome for all parties, as Kymera is an excellent partner for Reading to support their next stage of growth. For AMETEK, proceeds from the sale will be redeployed on our acquisition strategy, which remains our #1 priority for capital deployment. I would like to thank the Reading Alloys employees for their hard work and contributions to AMETEK and wish them continued success in the future. Our operational excellence strategy continues to drive record results and impressive efficiency improvements. In 2019, we generated approximately $95 million in operational excellence savings. This level of savings is an increase from our initial estimate of $80 million and speaks to the flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model to drive higher levels of productivity in the face of softening market conditions. Our businesses continued to utilize our operational excellence toolkit to improve efficiencies and productivity. A great example of these efforts came from our new instruments team, which won the Dr. John Lux Operational Excellence Award in 2019. During the year, the new instruments team conducted an operational excellence Kaizen and implemented lean processes to reduce the manufacturing cycle time of their scientific instruments for elemental and isotopic analysis. These changes drove a 40% reduction in working capital, shortened lead times for their customers and improved sales and profit growth at the business. Congratulations to the new instruments team on this outstanding achievement. This is one of the many examples across AMETEK, of our businesses driving meaningful productivity improvements through leveraging our operational excellence tools. Our businesses also continued to enhance our competitive positions through new product development and global and market expansion. In 2019, our businesses unveiled dozens of innovative new products and solutions. These solutions included award-winning advanced 3D scanners for quality control and quality assurance, revolutionary plasma-viewing technology for laboratory analysis, high-speed digital imaging technology, highly specialized test and measurement devices and x-ray microanalysis instrumentation. We remain focused on investing in this innovation to power our future. In 2019, we invested approximately $260 million, or about 5% of sales in the research, development and engineering of new products and solutions. These new technologies have been well received by our customers, as shown by our Vitality Index, which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last 3 years. In the fourth quarter, our Vitality Index was an outstanding 25%, speaking to the success of our product development efforts. Our businesses are also expanding our global footprint to reach customers in new geographies and adjacent markets. As an example, in 2019, we unveiled new Technology Solution Centers in both Singapore and France. These state-of-the-art facilities enable our businesses to showcase their products and solutions and better serve their customers with design, implementation, calibration and service capabilities. We remain focused on investing in these opportunities to expand our international sales channels and develop new innovative ways to better serve our customers and support our global growth initiatives. Now I'll move to our outlook for 2020. While we remain cautious, given the current uncertainties of the global macro environment, we are highly confident in the strength of the AMETEK Growth Model, and in our ability to continue to deliver strong performance. As such, we expect 2020 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.38, an increase of 1% to 5% over 2019's comparable result. This guidance range assumes the divestiture of Reading Alloys during the first quarter and excludes the gain on the anticipated sale. Overall sales in 2020 are expected to be up low single digits, with organic sales roughly flat for the year. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up low single digits versus the prior year. First quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.04 per diluted share, a 1% to 4% increase over the prior year period. So in summary, AMETEK delivered excellent performance in the fourth quarter, concluding a year with exceptional results and a decade that saw a tremendous growth for our AMETEK shareholders. The AMETEK Growth Model is proven and scalable and will continue to drive long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave mentioned, AMETEK completed 2019 with excellent performance in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for both the quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter general and administrative expenses were down modestly from the prior year and, as a percentage of sales, were 1.3%, down from last year's level of 1.5% of sales. In 2020, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with the full year 2019. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17.6%, down from last year's adjusted rate of 22.8%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was due to the tax benefits from stock compensation and the finalization of our 2018 tax returns. For 2020, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was excellent at 17.3%, down from 18.2% in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $41 million in the fourth quarter and $102 million for the full year. We expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be at a similar level to 2019 at approximately 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $64 million, and the full year was $234 million. In 2020, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $265 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $120 million or $0.52 per diluted share. As Dave has highlighted, our businesses continued to generate tremendous levels of cash flow. Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record $342 million, up 16% over last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow was also outstanding, up 15% versus the prior year to $301 million. Free cash flow conversion was exceptional at 137% of net income. Our full year cash flow levels were also at records. Operating cash flow for 2019 was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $1 billion, each increasing 20% over 2018. Free cash flow conversion in 2019 was an outstanding 118%. We continue to successfully deploy our strong cash flow on strategic acquisitions. We had another outstanding year in 2019 with $1.1 billion deployed on the acquisitions of Pacific Design Technologies and Gatan. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we deployed $115 million on the acquisition of IntelliPower. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we paid off $100 million of private placement senior notes, which matured in the quarter. Total debt at December 31 was $2.77 billion, up 5% from the end of 2018. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $393 million, resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.7x at year-end, consistent with year-end 2018. Following the acquisition of IntelliPower, we have approximately $1.4 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth investments. To finish, I'd like to echo Dave in thanking our colleagues for their excellent work in 2019. Our businesses delivered exceptional performance in the quarter and throughout the entire year. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2020 with a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Bill. Andrew, can we please open the line for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.
Matt Summerville: A couple of questions. First, Dave, can you maybe talk about what your expectation is from a purely an organic standpoint as we sort of cadence throughout the year from quarter-to-quarter, maybe first half versus back half embedded in your guidance?
David Zapico: Yes. Sure, Matt. Really, when we think about our guidance for organic growth in 2020, we're really assuming the same activity level that we saw in the fourth quarter and similar run rates expected throughout all of 2020. So there isn't a back-end hockey stick at all on our forecast. It follows a pretty typical H1, H2 of AMETEK. And now in terms of what it will look like as you proceed through the year, you'll have some negative organic growth comps during the first quarter - or the first half. But in terms of the level of activity, it's pretty linear sequentially and reflects the continuation of the pace of activity we saw in Q4 '19.
Matt Summerville: And then just as a follow-up. Can you do sort of your traditional walk through the businesses, what you saw in Q4 and kind of what the expectation is for 2020 across the portfolio?
David Zapico: Sure, Matt. I'll start with our Process business. They completed an excellent year in 2019 with a solid fourth quarter. Overall sales were up high single digits driven by contributions from acquisitions of Telular, Spectro Scientific and Gatan. Organic sales were flat in the quarter, generally in line with our expectations. However, we did see some slower discretionary CapEx at year-end. For 2020, we expect organic sales to be roughly flat versus 2019 for Process. Next, Aerospace. Overall sales for Aerospace & Defense businesses were up low single digits in the fourth quarter driven by the acquisition of PDT. Organic sales were down low single digits against a very difficult comp with a plus 10% Q4 '18 in last year's fourth quarter. We saw excellent mid-single-digit growth across our Aerospace & Defense platform in 2019. In 2020, we expect another solid year of growth across our A&D businesses with organic sales up low to mid-single digits and balanced growth across each segment. Organic sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up low single digits in the quarter, with particularly solid growth in our Programmable Power business. And for 2020, we expect organic sales to be roughly flat across Power & Industrial. And our Automation & Engineered Solutions business saw a mid-single-digit organic sales decline in the fourth quarter driven by continued softness across our global Automation businesses. In 2020, we expect our Automation & Engineered Solutions businesses organic sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year. That's the roundabout, Matt.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Rosenblatt.
Scott Graham: So a couple of questions. The oil and gas piece, I know, is a piece that has obviously been managed down over time. Acquisition is the whole thing. But obviously, that's taken - that market has taken a quite the turn for the worse with the coronavirus really kind of upsetting the sales side of things, I think, in the upstream. And I was just wondering kind of what you were thinking on oil and gas for the year. And then I do have a follow-up on the Automation business.
David Zapico: Okay. Yes. Our - we - in Q4, our Oil & Gas business was flat. There was some - it performed well. There was some project timing in the Middle East, but it had a flat performance. And for the full year, it was up mid-single-digits. And for '20 - for full year '20, we expect a flat performance, and we have a smaller upstream presence. Over 2/3 of our presence has been downstream. So it's about a 6% exposure for the whole company, about $300 million. And it's been growing, and we've grown around it. And the one point is, if you think back into the 2015, 2016 time period, the commodity-related businesses of AMETEK were 22% of our sales. After the - announcing the divestiture of Reading Alloys, that same commodity level businesses will be about 12% of our sales. So 6% oil and gas, 6% of metals. So we feel really good about our portfolio. We feel good about our exposures. And with the predominant Oil & Gas businesses in the mid and downstream, it looks solid. And we're still at that $50 an order, $50 a barrel level, when in past has been okay for us. So we're feeling pretty good about it, and we have some good projects that we're working on. And we have a good recurring revenue base in that part of the business.
Scott Graham: My follow-up on automation is simply could you kind of break that up by end market where things are weakest. I'm assuming that oil - that auto still goes in the lost column for now, but maybe just a little more color on that business.
David Zapico: If you want to understand that business, what really happened is the automation weakness continued, and the European automation was weaker than expected. So if you think back to last quarter, Europe was kind of strong, and Asia was the weak spot for automation. The U.S. - this quarter, the U.S. was positive. The weak spot was really Europe. So Europe and Asia maintained weakness, and that's really the story in the Automation business. Now a little bit of encouragement is in December and January, sequentially, the orders normalized. So we seemed to have found bottom, and we'll see if that continues. But it's pretty much a geographical issue where the European weakness was the unanticipated weakness in Q4.
Scott Graham: That's hugely helpful. If I could just sneak this last one in. It's a quick one. What's your productivity expectation for 2020?
David Zapico: Yes. The productivity expectation for 2020 is $90 million. So we began 2019 at $80 million. And through the year, we were - executed very well. We ended up at $95 million. But for 2020, for the start of the year, we set that at $90 million incremental. These are all incremental numbers. Those are incremental productivity numbers that you'll see working through the P&L.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray: I might have missed this, but could you tell us what the organic orders were for the segments? And maybe some comments versus expectations.
David Zapico: Yes, sure. I'll go through the whole orders pitch. I mean, it was - orders growth 8 - up 8% in the quarter. Organic orders were down 2%. And both groups were down low single digits. And as I said before, the weakness was driven by the automation and weaker year-end discretionary CapEx spending. And we're seeing - now with January and into the late parts of December, we're seeing sequential orders stabilized with our Automation business. And we have a record backlog of $1.72 billion, and we have a book-to-bill of 1.07 in the quarter. So that's the whole picture on orders, Deane.
Deane Dray: Got it. And then, look, the question, does your - this quarter, everyone's being asked how braced you are for disruptions in China. Is that about 9% of your revenues? Just in terms of potential demand disruptions and supply chain disruptions, is there anything embedded in your guidance for that? And kind of what near-term expectations do you have?
David Zapico: Yes. The first point, it's about 7% of our sales, and we're monitoring things very closely. And first and foremost, we're focused on the safety of our employees, well-being of our employees. And from a business perspective, as you know, the situation is very fluid and difficult to quantify, so our full year guidance is based on what we know now. And we do know that we don't have any significant operations in Wuhan and - nor any significant supply chain exposure to suppliers in the Wuhan City area. But we don't expect - we do expect there to be some delays in the global supply chain and some unanticipated consequences of the supply chain disruptions. So we'll monitor this closely. And we do have very global supply chain capability, so we'll adjust as possible and appropriate. It's very difficult at this point to assess any end demand risk without knowing the severity or longevity of the situation. And one point to highlight how fluid the situation is or - although our facilities in China have not reopened following the Lunar New Year, they'll reopen next week. One of our facilities is the Chinese government asked us to reopen to operate in order to provide support to a couple of medical device manufacturers that we have in China. We provide motion control solutions to our customers who supply medical equipment used to help to detect the coronavirus. So we're up and running today with a line to fill that need. So it's really changing all the time. And I think we've taken the steps to focus on the safety of both our employees in China and around the world. And as we learn more and we quantify it, we'll let you know what that is.
Deane Dray: Dave, that's real helpful. If I could just squeeze one more in regarding the topic of other potential divestitures. We really did like seeing trimming the Reading Alloys business. I know it's a good business, but the cyclicality didn't quite match what you're looking for. Compounders don't typically divest, so - because it's really hard to redeploy and get the same returns. But just - are you looking - as you look at the portfolio, are there any other potential candidates for trimming at the margin like that?
David Zapico: We do a strategic review every year, so we look hard at our portfolio. And Reading Alloys, as you mentioned, is a really good business. And it was just different for AMETEK. And it was more cyclical. And the value chain was different, where we didn't have the visibility that we have in our other businesses dealing with end customers. So it kind of stood out, and we made the decision to divest it. And it was a good decision. We still have a solid metals business, and we're very comfortable with our portfolio. And no other divestitures are planned at this time.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Just a follow-up on Deane's question on the portfolio. I guess, one of the unintended consequences of being kind of a long-term compounder with a good amount of success on the M&A side is that you need to do either larger deals or have higher velocity to kind of keep the momentum going. Clearly, 2019 was good evidence of both. When you look at the pipeline today, is it a bias toward larger acquisitions? And should we see that become more of the norm?
David Zapico: Yes, it's a great question, Josh. I mean, there are clearly some larger acquisitions on our pipeline, but there are also some smaller-sized acquisitions, too, more typical, and - like the IntelliPower one that you saw that we announced today. And as you know, acquisitions are our first priority for capital deployment. We want to deploy all of our free cash flow on M&A. And we had a successful 2019, and we had a successful 2018. If you look over those last 2 years, we completed 9 acquisitions. We deployed about $2.3 billion, and we acquired $610 million in sales. And I would say, our deal funnel remains consistent, so that we should be able to do the same kind of thing going forward. And we're - feels very good right now. We're evaluating a number of opportunities. As Bill mentioned, we have $1.4 billion of existing firepower with unused revolver capacity and cash. And even with these capital outlays, our - we're going to generate another - anticipate to generate another $1.1 billion in free cash flow. So we're very active. We have a team dedicated to it. The acquisitions at AMETEK are a combination of a set of well-defined processes, not a single event. And we have processes to develop the pipeline, and I feel really good about that right now.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And I guess, related to that, the productivity bogey for 2020 looks very solid. I guess, is part of this kind of ramp in productivity given that there are a lot of newer members of the AMETEK portfolio and running them through that operational rigor just leads to larger numbers? Or is there kind of another element of the productivity deck that you guys are unrolling?
David Zapico: Yes, I think it's a combination of both. The acquisitions do provide more opportunities. But at the same time, our growth model is very flexible. And when we get in times, like where the revenue starts to slow down, you saw it the last couple of quarters. We've been, business by business, looking at businesses and taking actions. And it's resulted in extremely strong execution and excellent margins. And we're continuing to get excellent pricing. We're continuing to get excellent productivity. So we really expect another strong year of execution in 2020, and it's really inherent in our model. We have operators that know how to run businesses through the cycle. And when the revenue line starts to waver a bit, then we know what to do. And we have a variety of contingencies planed. So I feel comfortable managing in this kind of environment.
Joshua Pokrzywinski: And if I can just sneak one small one in at the end here. Clearly, CapEx budgets are still very uncertain given all that's going on in the world. Any sense from customers that there's a bit of a coiled spring being formed and that there's projects that are set to release when we kind of get the all clear? Or are people just comfortable spending at lower levels?
David Zapico: With the trade deals that recently have been signed, there's a bit of a momentum building. And now you're dealing with the coronavirus situation. So it's kind of tough to get a read. But certainly, we're feeling some positive momentum building. And it felt like people were willing to spend. And now we just have to see the impact.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: So your comments on December, January were interesting because it's sort of very opposite to what we're hearing elsewhere. And I think your comments were more Europe, Asia as being weaker. And therefore, I'm wondering if you're seeing more stability in those regions. But my real question is more on the sequential Q-over-Q decline at EMG. It was down 8%, which tends to speak to some channel destocking activities. I'm just wondering if you could touch on that and then just a comment on the sort of regional stability question as well.
David Zapico: Yes. I mean, in the EMG, typically, parts of that business do have a slower fourth quarter historically, the calendar year. And it was relatively typical. The European Automation business was - we highlighted also on our Aerospace business, our military business is in the EMG segment, and that saw some program delays, that things were just delayed a bit. So - but as I said, the business has operated very well. We had excellent margin expansion. And certainly, that's - the Automation business has been challenged throughout the year, and the team there has done an excellent job of taking actions. And those are included in the results. We haven't spiked those out because it's just an individual business. That's what we do. And I - that's where we're at, at EMG. It's really automation-driven. It's European automation specifically, and there was a little bit of the military. That's just a timing issue. We have a very good backlog, but just a timing issue in Q4. In terms of the globe, we were solid growth in the U.S., while Europe and Asia were down in the quarter. So we had low single-digit growth in the U.S., particularly in Process and Power. And the Asia was down mid-single digits and similar to performance we had in Q3. And Europe was the change. And when we look at 2020, we expect the U.S. to do a little better. And maybe the international market is a little worse, but there is a small difference between them. So as I said, we set our plan for 2020 at the same activity level we saw in Q4. We feel pretty confident with that.
Nigel Coe: That's helpful. And your comment - I think you mentioned the book-to-bill was 1.07 in the quarter. Is that correct?
David Zapico: Yes.
Nigel Coe: Yes, that seems like a good number. I mean, I don't have the book-to-bill from last fourth quarter, 4Q '18. How does that 1.07 compare to sort of your normal book rate during 4Q?
David Zapico: Yes. I think that also has the acquisitions in that, where you're booking the backlog of the acquisition. So I think if you normalize out for the acquisitions, it will be around 1 approximately.
Nigel Coe: Okay. And that would be fairly normal.
David Zapico: Yes, that's fairly normal.
Nigel Coe: And just a quick one on D&A. I think you said $265 million for 2020. And that breaks up as $145 million for intangibles and then $120 million tangible.
William Burke: It's about - for 2020, it's about $160 million for amortization and depreciation about $105 million. And then - yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: So on record backlog, just wondering if you see kind of normal conversion going forward. It sounds like the military delays helped the backlog a little bit, so wondering if that is just kind of a one quarter push in your view and if EMG organic, kind of, is a little less negative most likely in the first quarter.
David Zapico: Yes. The EMG - the military is definitely going to correct itself, but the comps in Q1 are very difficult for EMG. So it will be roughly sequentially similar to the level it was in Q4. That would be the best way I can describe that, Chris. And did you have another question?
Christopher Glynn: Yes. I'm dealing one - other one right now. A lot has been asked is EMG, I missed acquisition component in the quarter. I did get Pacific in there, but I didn't hear you mention any acquisition contribution.
David Zapico: Yes. There was an acquisition component in EMG in the fourth quarter. It was about 1 point.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Just want to follow along on Josh's comment on acquisition - or his question. You clearly had a strong year. But as we enter 2020, we talked about size, but has your thought process around technology or end markets changed as you look for deals?
David Zapico: That's a great question. I mean, certainly, it's a similar-type businesses that we're looking for. We're looking for businesses that are noncyclical, businesses that have a good percentage of recurring revenue. If we can't find those types of things, we're looking for the return in an existing - around an existing exposure. And we have teams out there beating the bushes, digging up potential deals in many of these companies we've been following for years and years, so - and when AMETEK is looking at buying a business, it's often the ownership - the private ownership they want to retire or they're trying to - it's not how the stock market is doing or things like that. And the example of IntelliPower, we had a CEO that wanted to retire. And we've been working with them for years. So that's more of the type of deals that we're going to get during this time, and there's a wide horizon. But we're looking in the health care area. We're looking to extend our Process and analytical businesses, Aerospace, Power, it's all the above. We won't buy any cost-driven businesses that went in the market on cost. We're looking for differentiated businesses. That's our key criteria. And because we've been doing this so long, we have approximately 11 people dedicated to it. We know what's going on, and we feel good about the pipeline now. It's always difficult to predict when you're going to do a deal, if it's next quarter or not or - but I feel really good about the pipeline right now.
Allison Poliniak: No, that's great. And then just a last one on IntelliPower. Seems like a nice complement. What does it bring to AMETEK that may be a technology or whatever that you did not have before? Any color there?
David Zapico: Yes, sure. I mean, the big thing, we already have an existing presence in uninterruptible power supplies. And we sell it to the life sciences market, we sell it to the process market. And what IntelliPower brings is really those products, ruggedized uninterruptible power systems sold to mission-critical defense and industrial applications. So they're the largest supplier of ruggedized UPSs for the DoD. They serve a robust set of key programs and applications. Their products include UPS, power conditioners, external battery packs, power distribution units. And they're really a unique company in that they have a sole-source provider for numerous programs. They're on ships, land vehicles, ground stations, mobile networks, so with a blue-chip customer base. And they also have an industrial component that we think we can grow. So we're pretty happy with the acquisition, and there's a meaningful synergy opportunity. It's a mid-single-digit grower, strong visibility on revenue in the short term, solid management team remaining with the business, so we like the deal.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ivana Delevska with Gordon Haskett.
Ivana Delevska: So just wanted to ask about some of your higher-growth businesses, like Telular, Spectro and Creaform. Are they getting affected by the weaker macro at all?
David Zapico: Those are in our EIG segment and in our Process segment. And that businesses - those businesses are holding up very well. We did see some - we usually see a year-end - some capital spending and capital pledge, where people spend their capital at year-end, and that was a bit lighter. But overall, those businesses are doing very well.
Ivana Delevska: And then just one follow up on Gatan. How did the performance in the quarter and the current outlook compare to your acquisition plan?
David Zapico: Right, great question. I mean, the business performed well. It was a bit better than our forecast. So we're very pleased with that performance. And we also announced the combination of Gatan with another business unit within AMETEK. So that was announced in January, and it will drive a substantial synergy as we have really the same customer base. And I would characterize the integration as proceeding very well.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens.
Robert McCarthy: I guess the first question I would have is around the orders - the organic orders. Anything you can talk about the backlog in terms of price and how you feel about price because price is such a key lever for you, not only for, obviously, growth organically, but also for really shoring up your incremental margin conversion?
David Zapico: Yes. I mean, the price that we got in the fourth quarter was much like full year '19. So we had a positive spread of about 50 bps and very pleased with the results. And for '20, we expect about a 50 bp spread. Now we think there might be slightly lower inflation, about 1%. And the pricing that we have built into our operating model is about 1.5 points. But we expect a 50 basis point spread, improving productivity for next year. And we're confident that we're going to be able to deliver that because we've been performing so well over the past couple of years. And it is a bit lower than 2019, and that's because the incremental impact from tariffs will be lower also.
Robert McCarthy: Remind us what your pricing was in kind of the '15, '16 time frame during the teeth of the oil and gas recession. Was it a negative spread for several years?
David Zapico: I don't think it went negative, I don't think it went negative. I don't have those numbers in front of me. You can check with Kevin on that after the call, but I don't recall going negative at all.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. And then I guess, in terms of fourth quarter of '18, you weren't afraid at that time, and there was a pretty material drawdown in the market, obviously, to deploy capital for share repurchase when you thought it was prudent. Given the prospect that we might have a year of unclear macro, given the coronavirus, geopolitical trends, the election, it could be harder to transact on deals given kind of a tacit bid/ask spread in terms of properties, meaning people have a higher justification for selling than perhaps you're willing to buy, do you think you could amp up the share repurchase if you hit an air pocket in terms of the ability to transact on deals or you just don't see that happening?
David Zapico: Now it's a great question, Rob. I mean, the reality is we have a great pipeline, and we want to deploy our capital on M&A. And I think we're going to do that. But we look at our buyback strategy as more opportunistic. And we have a strong balance sheet. And if the - in the short term, there's overreaction from the marketplace, then we'll deploy our balance sheet to buybacks. But right now, we're focused on M&A.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
David Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Curious if you expect any follow-on impact in the first half from Boeing's kind of 737 Max production cost?
David Zapico: Yes, that's a great question, David. I mean, they - we're on a lot of different programs and all commercial aircraft, military, business jets, so we're not dependent on any one aircraft. But specifically to your question, the 737 Max will be about a $10 million headwind in 2020, and that assumes a start-up of production based mid-year in our current build plan. So it's about a $10 million headwind versus 2018 - 2019, excuse me.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And as a quick follow-up. How did EMG bookings, maybe the pipeline develop as you went through the quarter? And any commentary on first quarter to date?
David Zapico: Yes, yes. The EMG bookings, like I had said previously, it was weaker as the quarter started. But the orders stabilized in December, and that continued in January. So we showed a typical - fairly typical ramp in Q4 for the entire business, and EMG was included in that. And then in January, we had a good order month, right in line with our plan. And as I said, sequentially, from December, January, it feels like the EMG automation orders have stabilized and - during that short time period.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.
Andrew Buscaglia: Can you touch on - you talked about the automation weakness continuing and orders somewhat normalized December, January. But can you talk about what - I know you talked regionally, but what about your other areas of the business? What other areas normalized or weakened or got worse because the major - organic orders are down about 2% or low single digits in each business. I would think some things got worse.
David Zapico: Yes. The other thing, there's really another major factor, and I mentioned that earlier. We experienced weaker discretionary CapEx spend than we anticipated. And then the related point, and it's more of a sales issue versus an orders issue, was program delays in - and for military in our Aerospace business in the fourth quarter.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird.
Richard Eastman: Dave, just a quick question around - as you look into 2020 with kind of a flat core growth expectation, when you look at Process, and I think your commentary around the Automation business and EMG both flat-flat, it seems like Aerospace, I think you commented low single to mid-single digits. When you look at those 3 buckets of exposure, where do you see the risk to 2020 from a core growth standpoint?
David Zapico: Yes. We try to put a plan together that deal with that by taking the run rates that we're currently at. So we didn't want a hockey stick budget, and we think we have that factored in. But there's clearly risks, and they're more macroeconomic risk than AMETEK's specific risk because the businesses are executing very well. We have a record backlog. We're going to be able to execute on that backlog. We had excellent pricing in the backlog. We're showing the capability to generate excellent productivity. So we're expecting another strong year of execution. And with our crystal ball, we called it flat. And we've tried to base the run rates based on 2019 because we don't like hockey stick plans. And that's where we're at, and that's our best attempt to moderate the guidance with the realities of the market.
Richard Eastman: As you look out into 2020, so difficult to sift out op margins from acquisitions and that contribution. But what kind of improvement do you expect to see in op margins for the full year? Are we talking about maybe 50 basis points? Or what kind of...
David Zapico: Yes, we had 100 basis points in all of 2019. We had 90 basis points core margins in the fourth quarter. And in our plan, we have 30 to 40 basis points of margin improvement - core operating income margin improvement.
Richard Eastman: Okay, for '20. Okay. And then just a very last question here. Just a quick question around Gatan. You mentioned it had a good fourth quarter as it came in for the partial quarter. As we spoke when the business was acquired, I think we're thinking maybe $100 million of - or excuse me, $180 million of revenue for the - for a full year. Growth rate was mid-singles to high singles. There's been some commentary maybe a thermo kind of speaking to weakness in the electron microscope market, which I'm curious. What would be a good revenue contribution in your plan for '20 from Gatan?
David Zapico: Yes. I think it's pretty much what we laid out. It's roughly $180 million.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.
Robert Jamieson: This is Rob Jamieson on for Joe this morning. Just a quick question on IntelliPower. Can you maybe talk about the margin profile or what your expectations for that business are?
David Zapico: Yes. It's a profitable business, and we paid 9x EBITDA, so it's - you can figure that out. It's roughly a 30% EBITDA business. And we paid $150 million, approximately 3x sales. And we think there's a meaningful synergy opportunity, so we're going to get great return for our stakeholders.
Robert Jamieson: Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up on the 737 Max. I know this is a small - a very small piece of your Aero's total business. But in terms of what's baked in your guide, how many planes or production number? Like, what's your production number embedded in your guidance there? Is it like 0? Or...
David Zapico: No, I think our - the number is a little bit difficult for us to forecast. And I don't know what disclosure agreements we have with Boeing. I can say that we plan on starting our activity midyear, and it would be about a $10 million headwind, yes.
Robert Jamieson: Okay. And you guys have like 37,000 per plane content-wise, right?
David Zapico: Yes, that's right.
Operator: We would like to thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. AMETEK delivered another outstanding quarter with exceptional operating performance, earnings above expectations, solid organic sales growth, and the acquisition of two highly strategic businesses. Our execution of the AMETEK growth model, including an increased focus on operational excellence allowed us to report record levels of EBITDA, operating income and diluted earnings per share in the quarter. Additionally, our business has generated record operating cash flow, providing the capital to support our growth model and drive strong long-term shareholder returns. Given our results in the quarter, we will once again raise our earnings guidance for 2019. Now on to the financial highlights for the quarter. Total sales were $1.28 billion, up 7%, compared to the third quarter of 2018. Organic sales were up 3%, acquisitions added 5%, and foreign currency was a one point headwind. AMETEK's operating performance in the quarter was exceptional, resulting in record operating results and robust margin expansion. EBITDA in the third quarter increased 12% over the prior year to $349 million. EBITDA margins in the quarter were also excellent at 27.4%. Operating income was $301.1 million in the quarter, up 13% over the third quarter of 2018. Reported operating income margins were up an impressive 140 basis points to 23.6%. And excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins increased 150 basis points over the prior-year period. Earnings in the third quarter were $1.06 per diluted share, up 16% over the same quarter in 2018. This comfortably exceeded our guidance range of $1 to a $1.02 per share. Additionally, our business has generated $330 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, up an impressive 33% over the same period last year, resulting in outstanding cash conversion in the quarter. Now onto the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG sales in the quarter were $815.6 million, up 10% over last year's third quarter. Recent acquisitions contributed 7%, organic sales added 3% and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. We continue to see solid growth across our Aerospace, Defense and Process businesses, with particularly strong growth again in our Materials Analysis division. EIG delivered fantastic operating performance in the quarter, with operating income up 15% to a record $219.5 million. Reported operating income margins increased 130 basis points to 26.9%. And excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's operating margins expanded an impressive 170 basis points over the third quarter of 2018. The Electromechanical Group also performed exceptionally well in the quarter, with solid organic sales growth and superb operating performance. Sales in the third quarter for EMG were $461.1 million, up 2% over the same quarter in 2018. Organic sales grew 3%, with contributions from the acquisition of Pacific Design Technologies being more than offset by foreign currency headwinds. Strong growth across our Engineered Materials and Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter was offset in part by continued slowing in our Automation business. EMG's operating performance in the third quarter was also outstanding. Operating income increased to a record $103.5 million, up 12% over the 2018 third quarter. EMG’s operating income margins increased sharply to a record 22.4%, up 180 basis points over the prior-year period. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, EMG margin expanded 190 basis points in the quarter. To summarize, AMETEK delivered another quarter of fantastic results, reflecting the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model and the excellent work of our colleagues worldwide. Before providing our updated guidance for 2019, I wanted to provide some additional highlights for the quarter. First, I'd like to congratulate the team at CAMECA for their recent launch of the EIKOS-UV Atom Probe microscope. CAMECA is the world leader in Atom Probe Tomography. The new Atom Probe Tomography scope reinforces the leadership position with increased ease-of-use at a lower cost of ownership. The EIKOS-UV delivers nanoscale structural information enabling a new understanding of materials for research and faster development of products for industrial applications. This new product complements CAMECA's LEAP 5000 Atom Probe which provides the fastest most sensitive 3D imaging and analysis system with nanoscale resolutions across a wide range of applications. Developing leading-edge technologies is the core to AMETEK's success. We are committed to continuing our strong levels of investment in research, development and engineering of new products and the solutions to drive innovation across our businesses. For all of 2019, we expect to invest more than $260 million in RD&E, a 13% increase over 2018. This level of investment and success of our R&D effort leads to a healthy vitality index. Our vitality index which is a measure of sales from products and solutions introduced over the last three years was excellent at 24% in the third quarter. We also remain committed to investing in our sales and service capabilities to support our global and market expansion initiatives. And in September, we unveiled our newest center of excellence in Singapore. This center of excellence, which is similar to other centers we have around the world, includes products and solutions from numerous AMETEK businesses including Rauland, Taylor Hobson, ZYGO, EDAX, Programmable Power and others. This state-of-the-art facility serves as a product showcase, application lab and service facility for our customers and partners in the region. Congratulations to our teams on this important effort. Now shifting to acquisitions. It has been another very active and highly successful year on the acquisition front. Since our last earnings call, we've acquired two excellent businesses: Pacific Design Technologies, or PDT for short, and Gatan. I'll touch briefly on these acquisitions, first PDT. PDT is a leading provider of advanced, mission-critical thermal management solutions. Their custom-engineered liquid cooling systems and components are used across a broad set of current and next-generation commercial aerospace, defense and space platforms. PDT is an excellent fit with our Thermal Management Systems business, given their complementary thermal management solutions and deep R&D expertise. PDT is headquartered in Goleta, California and has annual sales of approximately $40 million. We deployed approximately $125 million on the acquisition. Now moving to AMETEK's largest acquisition today, Gatan, which we acquired this week. Gatan is a tremendous acquisition for AMETEK. Market leading technologies, premier brand, highly complementary fit with our existing instrumentation businesses, attractive mid to high single-digit growth rates, excellent profitability and cash flow and the ability to drive improved profitability with excellent returns on capital. Overall, an excellent acquisition. So a little more on the business. Gatan is a leading brand in direct detection technology for electron microscopy, supporting high-end research and materials and life science applications. Their solutions enable improved microscopy workflows and specimen preparation, imaging and analysis. Gatan's technology and product offering nicely complements our Materials Analysis Business, providing AMETEK with an enhanced position in high-end analytical instrumentation and expanded capabilities in the Life Sciences market. The business is headquartered in Pleasanton, California and has annual sales of approximately $180 million. We deployed approximately $925 million on this acquisition. Thus far in 2019, we deployed nearly $1.1 billion on these two acquisitions. This follows 2018 when we deployed over $1.1 billion on six acquisitions, resulting in approximately $2.2 billion of capital deployed on acquisitions over the last two years. This success speaks to the strength and discipline of our acquisition and integration process. Even with this level of activity, our acquisition pipeline remains full and we have significant balance sheet capacity to continue our acquisition strategy. As we integrate these recent acquisitions into AMETEK, we look for them to embrace each of the elements of the AMETEK growth model, including our operational excellence strategy focused on cost and asset management. As evidenced in our tremendous operating performance, margin expansion and cash flow generation this year, our businesses continue to drive meaningful and efficiency improvements through the implementation of our operational excellence initiatives. We have again increased our full year target for operational excellence savings from $85 million to now $90 million of savings in 2019. Our operational excellence strategy plays an increasingly important role, given the uncertain global economic environment. Now shifting to the outlook for the fourth quarter. Given our strong results in the third quarter, we now expect 2019 earnings to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.14 per diluted share, up 13% over 2018's earnings per diluted share. This new guidance range has increased from our previous guidance range of $4.04 to $4.10 per diluted share. We expect overall sales for the year to be up mid to high single digits with organic sales growth of approximately 3%. Fourth quarter sales are expected to be up mid-single digits with earnings in the range of $1.01 to $1.03 per diluted share, up 5% to 7% over the prior year. To summarize, our third quarter performance was excellent. We are well-positioned to managing in a challenging economic environment given the flexibility of our growth model and proven operating capability. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted AMETEK had an excellent third quarter with strong operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights. Core selling expense in the quarter was down slightly versus the third quarter of last year. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were up $4.1 million year-over-year on higher compensation expense. For the full year, we expect general and administrative expenses to be approximately 1.5% of sales in line with 2018. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.5%, down from last year's third quarter tax rate of 21.9%. For 2019, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Working capital was 18.2% in the third quarter, down slightly from 18.3% in the second quarter of this year. Capital expenditures were $18 million in the quarter and $62 million for the year-to-date. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million or about 1.9% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense was $55 million in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $235 million, including after tax acquisition related intangible amortization of $100 million or $0.44 per diluted share. Our businesses continue to generate very strong levels of cash flow. Third quarter operating cash flow was a record $330 million, up 33% over last year's third quarter. Free cash flow was $311 million, up 35% over the same period. As a percentage of net income, free cash flow conversion was an impressive 141% in the quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% of net income. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $2.43 billion, down from $2.63 billion at the end of 2018. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $735 million, resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of September 30 of 1.2 times. As Dave noted, we continue to be very active deploying our capital on strategic acquisitions. In the third quarter, we acquired PDT and subsequent to the end of the quarter we acquired Gatan. Combined, we deployed $1.1 billion on these two acquisitions. Our pipeline remains healthy and we have significant financial flexibility to continue to execute our acquisition strategy with approximately $1.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities available following the Gatan acquisition. In summary, our businesses delivered excellent results in the third quarter and through the first nine months of the year. We remain well-positioned to support our long-term growth strategy given our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin? 
Kevin Coleman: Thank you, Bill. Justin, could we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, Dave can you maybe talk a little bit about what incoming organic order rates look like during the quarter in total for AMETEK and across the two segments?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Sure, Matt. Overall, orders were up 3% in the quarter. Organic orders were down negative 2.5%. And if I look at that by group, the EIG organic orders remain solid. They were positive. Solid across most of EIG portfolio, aerospace, process, medical. EMG orders were down, mainly due to our automation business and Asia. As we highlighted last quarter, we're experiencing soft conditions in those two areas and – which continued into quarter three.
Matt Summerville: And then, maybe, just talk a little bit more about the Gatan acquisition. Historically speaking, shied away might be too strong of a term, but you haven't really done much in the Life Sciences space, opting instead more for medical and healthcare with Rauland and some of the other businesses. So maybe talk about what attracted you now to Life Sciences? So maybe sort of a why now question. And then, what you see in that business potentially from a synergy standpoint and the level of cyclicality we should expect out of that business?
Dave Zapico: Right, right. Yeah. Our Materials Analysis business that Gatan will become a business unit of, has had an existing Life Science presence and it's been a small presence and we haven't talked about it much, but certainly with Gatan they're – in market they're a 50-50 split between life sciences, so biology, cancer research and then material sciences. So it fits our existing profile. But it does add life sciences capability and we really like that. And with their technology and what their market exposures, there's really attractive growth opportunities. We think it's a mid to high single-digit grower. I mean, when I think about the Gatan business, it's a very differentiated technology business. It's a sizable transaction with strong profitability for AMETEK shareholders will get a good return on capital. It's a premier brand. We followed this business for a long time. It's a premier brand. They have highly specialized intellectual properties over 150 patents in the business and a strong management team. They’re staying with the business so we're pleased about that. And it's a business that is dependent on new product introductions. So we're going to have to work on the new product introduction cycle because that drives a lot of growth. And I think you can expect it to fit into MAD and MAD is performing very well for AMETEK. So it's a great add to MAD. So we're very excited about the acquisition.
Matt Summerville: Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray: Hey, Dave maybe pick up on your last point about the macro-environment. You said it's a challenging operating environment, but you put up great margins and cash flow. But you did point to some weakness in automation in Asia and this is consistent with what we've seen elsewhere in the sector this quarter, short-cycle pressures in Asia in particular. So could you expand a bit on what you're seeing in the automation side in terms of the softness? And then how would you characterize the softness in Asia? Is that trade uncertainty related?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Sure Deane. Asia was down for us by -- I'll start with the geography question. Asia was down mid-single digits and that was driven by China, so very similar to quarter two for us. So, it was really the same trend. Our automation business did not weaken sequentially. It was the same trend. But at the same time, the other geographic results were similar to the second quarter. We were up mid-single digits with broad-based growth in the U.S., and in Europe we were up mid-single digits and we have aerospace and our oil and gas business and really a lot of businesses did well in Europe. So the -- it felt like Q2, the weakness played into Q3 continue to -- didn't get weaker. And we did see a little bit of incremental industrial weakness that showed up in our Power and Industrial business in quarter three. But overall when you think about our portfolio, our Aerospace business is very strong. Our Process businesses are rock solid. And our medical business is holding up well. And we have a weakness in automation in Asia and then we have a bit of incremental Industrial weakness and that's the full picture that we have.
Deane Dray: That certainly is consistent with what we've been seeing. Any comments about how October has played out? And then I know you're not in the business yet of giving 2020 guidance but just qualitatively for this challenging operating environment, what's the setup for next year for AMETEK in the way your discussions with customers, the visibility on product introductions and so forth? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Right. I'll start with the insight in 2020. As is typical for this time of the year, we're not going to give guidance for 2020 as you know Deane, and during November and December, we're going to sit down with our teams and work with the businesses to build a bottom-up budget and this will include a detailed review of our niche markets, which are sometimes different than the overall macro. And the risks and opportunities that our businesses see in their 2020 business plan. I think in terms of operating in this kind of environment with trade tensions and customers hesitant to spend and ordering patterns changing a bit in terms of just giving an order for what you need versus giving you a longer-term outlook at something there are some issues to deal with. But AMETEK is ideally suited to thrive in this environment because we have the OpEx capability, it's in our DNA and we have the M&A driver. And we're going to put those two elements of our strategy to work and succeed in the current environment. That's the way we're looking at it and that will go into our 2020 planning.
Deane Dray: And any comments on October?
Dave Zapico: October, yes. Yeah, I'll get back to that. Yeah, throughout the quarter, we looked at our orders and they were okay in July. They stepped up a bit in August as we typically have. And then September sometime when -- September was stronger than August, but we didn't get the big spike of orders in September. So it was a bit muted. It was still better than August. So we had a normal stair-step through the quarter. And then October starting out right on plan, so October feels better, a lot like the first quarter of the first month of Q2 ,so -- and Q3. So we got this trend where we're stepping up by month of the quarter, but it's a bit muted usually in the last month of the quarter.
Deane Dray: Terrific. And then congratulations on Gatan. That's a great asset. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you. Thank you Dean. We feel the same way.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Hi, Josh good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Just -- one of the questions we get a lot is, kind of, AMETEK compared this cycle to maybe the last industrial slowdown. I know it's something that comes up from time to time on calls that folks are always worried that the next move of the ISM is going to be down for AMETEK. But you guys have been much more resilient especially this year. Can you talk David all about, how you're mixing up through M&A whether that's margins or organic growth? And maybe specifically on how the, kind of, portfolio evolution of exposure to customers R&D versus CapEx spend has maybe changed?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, sure. I mean, every slowdown is a bit different Josh. So basing performance on the prior slowdown is often -- is not going to work out. But what we see is we really have as I mentioned to Deane earlier, we have elements of our portfolio that are continuing to perform very well. Our Aerospace business is strong and that's strong across all segments of Aerospace, and we have some good wins in Aerospace that we're going to continue to benefit from. Our Process and Analytical instrumentation, we added some healthcare to that and that's holding up very well for us. The commodity parts of our businesses that were about 22% of our sales before we head into the 2015, 2016 downturn. They're down around 16% of our businesses, because we grew around them. At the same time, those businesses are performing well right now. So this doesn't feel like the prior downturn for us. And -- but there is -- this one is -- I'll call it self induced and it's different. And it's really trade-related to start at it, and it's affecting the customer behavior because of that. And what we're going to do is whatever the economy brings to us; we're going to operate well in it. And we think we're well-positioned with our operational excellence capability. And we have the M&A driver and it's working very well. So, we're -- like I said before, we're looking to outperform in the current environment.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Terrific. And then just a follow-up. Obviously, margins have been pretty spectacular throughout the year; I think another step-up in the third quarter. How should we think about kind of the progression from here? And any kind of puts and takes, either related to seasonality or any kind of blue birds in the quarter that may have helped out?
Dave Zapico: Right, right. Yes, you said, we had excellent margin performance in the quarter and it was primarily overall excellent execution. I mean we had good price in the quarter, excellent cost reductions, the plant efficiencies were fantastic, and we had the incremental contribution margin on the incremental sales. So, we plan to keep executing that way. I don't know if the margins are going to continue at that level. We certainly -- the way we think about our business is we think we're going to get 30 to 40 basis points of core margin expansion every year and that's kind of built into our operating model. And that's built into the way we think about operational excellence long-term. So, there's cost reduction drivers that we have in our business that -- and we pull those levers and there's plenty of runway on margins. So, that's how we think about it.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Great. Thanks for the detail and congratulations.
Dave Zapico: Yes, thanks, Josh.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning Nigel.
Nigel Coe: Hey, just I'll echo the comments on operating margins, great execution there. And I did want to put a finer point on kind of going to the next level on Q4 guidance. And really want to dig into Gatan. Roper mentioned that the business would be very heavy skewed towards Q4, much more so than usual this year. So, I'm just curious what you're baking in for sales, EBITDA, and the level of accretion, if any, that you have baked into Q4? And anything else that you're sort of baking into your guidance for Q4 would be helpful.
Dave Zapico: Right. So, talk about -- we own Gatan for two months and we have about $35 million of sales in our forecast over those two months. And we're planning that to be neutral to Q4 earnings at the cash EPS level. I mean, we have -- there's purchase accounts, there's a lot of inventory in the business. So, the inventory step-up charges are significant. We have all the deal costs. We have higher interest expense, one-time charges. And as a matter of fact, Q4 was front-end loaded per Gatan's forecast. So, when you take the $35 million that we're forecasting and what we think Gatan did in October, really quarter-over-quarter; it's about the same as it did last year. And the management team is -- they've been through a lot. They've been through an extended sales process. There's a lot of integration activity and -- but we're going to push forward with a Q4 equal to last year's Q4, which was good.
Nigel Coe: Sorry about that. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And if you want to prognosticate on Gatan EPS increase for next year that would be great. But I did want to touch on Josh's question a slightly different way. And if we take the acquisitions you've done for the past, call it, two or three years, and I'm thinking here about Rauland-Borg, Tell [ph], Spectro, et cetera. How are those businesses performing right now relative to the 3% you just put up? I mean are they above that bar? Are they stable? I mean how does that look?
Bill Burke: Yeah. I think the acquisitions being primarily North America focused, like WR, like Rauland-Borg and the end markets that they're in, they're performing very well. So they're at/or above our model. And the U.S. centricity of some of those businesses is clearly helping us in the current environment.
Nigel Coe: Okay, great. Thank you, Bill.
Bill Burke: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Andrew Obin: Hey, guys. Good morning. Great quarter.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Just a question. Can we talk a little bit about aerospace and specifically, A, can you remind us of the composition of your aerospace exposure? And can we talk about what are you seeing about commercial aftermarket business as traffic slows? And also, what are you guys seeing on bizjets, because I know that's an important business for you as well? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: So, broad-brush, our aerospace business is about 35% military, about 30% third-party MRO, about 25% commercial, and that's equally split between the OEM and the proprietary spare parts that come from that and about 10% of the business jet market. And the aerospace business for us, in Q3 the whole business was up high single digits. It was strong in all segments. Our commercial business in Q3 was up mid-teens. So we had strong OEM sales to the Airbus 320 platform, the 787, the LEAP and GTF engines are doing well. Our third-party MRO business had an excellent quarter, up high single digits. Our military business was up high – mid-single digits. So solid demand in both the U.S. and international programs, our strength in missiles, radar systems, general spending tied to improving fleet readiness, and our business jet market was up high teens. And at easier comp, but it was up high teens. So we really had a fantastic performance in our aerospace business in the quarter. And the backlogs are very solid. And to your specific question, our aftermarket was very solid in Q3, and we're not seeing a sign of a slowdown.
Andrew Obin: I guess Eleanor is doing quite well.
Dave Zapico: Eleanor has fantastic orders.
Andrew Obin: Just a follow-up question and this is more for my decision. How should I think about the relationship directionally between your order rates and organic growth? Because, clearly, orders slowed last quarter. We did not see a similar slowdown in revenue this quarter, what has continued to slow. And clearly, you guys think that revenue can continue to outpace the orders. What's the disconnect? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: I think, the biggest disconnect there is, we have a pretty healthy backlog. So it's about a $1.63 billion backlog at the end of Q3, and it provides some conversion opportunities. And the balance of our business besides the aerospace and defense business, we're probably going through a quarter, needing about 50% of the orders to make the quarter, but we have some visibility in our aerospace and defense businesses. And we're operating the company well, and we're able to convert on them. So we feel comfortable with our guide. And we have – cautious, given the global macro conditions. And -- but our factories are executing extremely positively right now. So I feel very confident that if there's incoming orders or opportunities in our backlog to execute on it, we can. And that's how you bring together a flat to slightly declining order picture and combine it with growing organically.
Andrew Obin: Very clear that the team is executing very well. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Allison Poliniak: Hi guys, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: Just following up on that backlog commentary. Are you getting any, sort of, pushback or delays within that backlog that, I guess, delaying some of that conversion?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, there's a changing order pattern that we saw in the quarter. And typically, a customer will give you a purchase order with three or six month’s visibility. And now when they're giving us a replenishment purchase order, they're really giving it month-to-month, just what they need. So there is an element of the global macro conditions that are impacting our order input. But our cycle times are reduced, and our factory execution is really good. So we're able to deal with that on and turn things very quickly. But certainly, there is a change in the ordering environment that wasn't there six months ago.
Allison Poliniak: Great. And then just on the OpEx savings, is that because of that step up because of Gatan and the acquisitions? Or is that organic that you guys are accelerating some of that?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. There's no OpEx savings in the final two months for Gatan. It's organic savings, we boosted our material savings from -- up to $70 million. That was the $5 million increase in -- with all the tariff activity. We have a world-class sourcing organization. And they're executing on it, resourcing the products at a faster rate than we thought they would, and we're getting incremental savings from it because we're finding lower cost in other places in the world. So it's -- that's what's driving the savings up to the $90 million. It's all material cost savings.
Allison Poliniak: Okay. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Allison.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stephens. Your line is now open.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the quarter.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Rob.
Robert McCarthy: I guess, first on Gatan kind of stepping back, obviously, a very well-run company under Roper's per view, but obviously, Roper in terms of its governance and overall models, not big on centralization and cost synergies among their various disparate businesses. Clearly, that's a point of differentiation. So, could you expand qualitatively or quantitatively about how you see the opportunity to expand margins? And maybe a little bit of color around fixed cost leverage, SG&A, gross margins? Where do you think are the biggest buckets where you can drive incremental value on that?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Sure, sure. It’s obvious question, and we're going to work with the Gatan team to come up with a plan that we both agree with, because we think there are some opportunities, but we get buy-in from the management teams. But what we see is, it's more like a typical deal synergy for us. There's a lot of opportunity in the supply chain to reduce costs. There's eight remote sales and service offices, so a bigger than typical opportunity to benefit from the AMETEK G&A internationally. There's also opportunities to improve working capital. This business is running at a working capital level in the mid-20s, and our equivalent business is running at about 14% in materials analysis. AMETEK's overall working capital is about 18.2% in the quarter. So we add that all up, the cost synergy from the supply chain, the substantial synergy from the international offices, the ability to reduce working capital and we think it's going to be a great return for our shareholders. We think we'll get a return on invested capital of 10% in year 3, and we're excited about it.
Robert McCarthy: And just on that point, as one brief follow-up on Gatan. What do you think about the perspective of the growth rate? Because I think you talk about mid single-digit organic growth. But just in doing our own due diligence, it could be fairly lumpy. And part and parcel of that is, they're definitely seems to be more of a product cycle business, branded their hit rate on product cycles are very high. But aftermarket may be more of a concern. So how would you talk about kind of the sustainability of growth and managing a little bit of a lumpiness there?
Dave Zapico: Right. Yes. Naturally, the business is a bit lumpy. And -- but they're direct detection cameras, they're fantastic technologies. They were -- and they've really enabled a new technique called CRY OEM; cryo electron microscopy. And this technique is being developed for drugs and vaccines, and it's opened up the life sciences market to a greater degree for them. So they're really in the -- they have a good long-term demand driver, only about 10% of the business is aftermarket, but -- and it is a bit lumpy, and it's driven by new product cycles. So one of the things we're going to try to do is increase the velocity of the new product cycles, but we'll deal with a bit of lumpiness. And we like the business a lot.
Robert McCarthy: Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, good morning. Could you just give us a sense of what price did, price capture and net price capture in the quarter?
Dave Zapico: Yes. Q3 was much like the first half of 2019. We had an excellent quarter. So we achieved a little bit more than 2 points of price across our entire business. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs was a bit less than 1.5%. So we're very pleased with the results and they speak to the highly differentiated nature of our product portfolio. We have leadership positions in the niche markets around the globe, and it's playing itself out in these uncertain times.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then could you -- Dave, perhaps just shift through EMG's core growth rate by segment a little bit or by business within EMG. We had 3%. I'm just a little bit curious. I mean automation softened. But just -- and could you do that, please?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I could. If you look at the market segments and automation and engineered solutions, so they already got the automation business is about half of it and Engineered solutions, which is basically is about the other half of it. So we had solid growth in the EMIP business. It was up I think it was up mid-single digits in the quarter, and automation was down. And overall, it was up low single digits for the quarter. So really, the EMIP business is performing very well. And as we mentioned, we have a problem in -- with the slowdown in our automation business. And when you think about our thermal Management Systems business, that's the other business in there. They had a solid quarter, in line with our aerospace business. .
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just is the EMIP business following the aerospace business up? I mean is that where the strength is kind of generated?
Dave Zapico: I mean the end markets for EMIP, our aerospace and medical and specialized industrial. So that mid-single-digit growth was across all those markets. So they really done well.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just my last question, David, as you kind of sit here today, and I know we don't want to touch 2020 from an outlook perspective, maybe on the sales line. But is it your sense that we're seeing enough slowing into this – into the fourth quarter here that we maybe have to take a harder look at the cost side of the business, whether it would be savings plans or any sort of tighter restructuring or realignment of cost? Where do you sit on that? Or is it kind of business as usual, and we're going to walk into this with our operational excellence plan and eyes wide open?
Dave Zapico: That's a great question, Rick. And I'll start with the point that we have people running the businesses that are good operators of the businesses. And we're going to go through a budget process with each of our business units. And you can see in the results, they're already naturally reacting to the changing global conditions. And right now, this feels for – this feels like a – for Bill and I, like a business-to-business discussion. So we're going to sit down with these budgets, and we're going to understand the projects that they want to fund and what makes sense for AMETEK to fund and what makes sense for their businesses to act on. And right now, it seems like a business-to-business decision. But if it turns into a broader alignment, if it certainly weakens further. We're not there yet, but that's an option, and we're going to really explore that in detail during November and the beginning part of December. And the important thing for us is that we're going to continue to invest in attractive opportunities that and make our core stronger, and that's our talent development, our innovation but we're really good at managing costs. And we'll have a good, healthy discussions during our budget process, and I expect that it will be a business-to-business discussion, and the businesses will come with opportunities to us to...
Richard Eastman: And given some of – given some of your business, I'm thinking aerospace is kind of in the backlog, and we're talking about backlog conversion here kind of rolling forward. Do you sense that the pricing contribution in 2020 would be as great in 2020, as it has been here in 2019? I mean, is there visibility in your backlog on price for next year?
Dave Zapico: That's a good question, Rick. And we're going to have that detail when we go through our budget, but my feeling is that the pricing power of our portfolio is something that – through up cycles or down cycles, is there. And I think the level of pricing offsetting cost and inflation in tariffs is going to stay. So I'd be very surprised if pricing did not exceed inflation in tariffs in 2020.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Brett Linzey: Hi, good morning, guys. I just want to come back to thinking about the next year, 2020. Just in the context of margins, obviously, the revenue like a go either way, but thinking of Q2 or Q3 is sort of the run rate, low single-digit organic decline environment. Do you think that based on the deals you've done, some of the actions underway that you can actually grow margins in a down organic sales environment next year?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think it's possible. It has to do with – to Rick's question, the prior question, the level of pricing that you get and the level of acquisition synergies that we're executing on. But if you have a modestly declining order input, yes, you can expand margins like that. It won't be like the margins that you see in the second quarter, but certainly an up margin trajectory as possible.
Brett Linzey: Okay, great. And then maybe just another question on metals. Obviously, good performance here in the quarter. I think you said mid-single digits. What's your visibility into the value chain or the supply chain on inventory levels? I know last cycle kind of got back -- kind of backfilled as you worked up the value chain. What does the inventory look like today?
Dave Zapico: Yes. The metals business, as you know, the nature of that business is we have less visibility into the -- that the inventory levels at the various customers than we do in our other business. So, our end markets right now are driving that business and aerospace and medical still feels solid. So, that will be something that we look at closely during the budget and at the end of the next quarter to understand what's happening there.
Brett Linzey: Okay. But no indication that things are full or that anything starting to back up there?
Dave Zapico: Up mid-single-digit quarter.
Brett Linzey: Yeah. Okay, great. Appreciate, I'll leave it there.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Robert in for Joe. Congrats in the quarter. Good morning. Just a high-level question as we head into next year, not specific guidance. But are there any particular end markets that you feel are kind of like at risk versus your current view this year? And did you see any changes in any end markets this quarter that you found surprising? Or any changes in trends that are worth noting? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Sure. It's really the comment that I made before. Q3 felt very similar to Q2, but we did see some incremental weakening in our industrial businesses. And when we go into next year, we're going to have a clear view of that once we work through our budget process with all of our businesses because we have some niche exposures that are a little bit different than the overall macro, and we have to understand that. But certainly, the aerospace business feels very solid right now.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia from Berenberg.
Andrew Buscaglia: Hey guys. Can you comment just a little bit more on Gatan? And correct me if I'm wrong, I think the price Thermo Fisher paid seems to be a little bit below what you guys -- your implied EBIT/EBITDA multiple was that? And I would think that they would be able to drive synergies -- substantial synergies as well. So, can you just talk about how you -- like in terms of the valuation you've paid? And was this a competitive bid? Just talk about the process a little bit more there?
Dave Zapico: Yes, Andrew, I think you might have your numbers wrong. If you go back and look at it, we paid about the same. We paid the identical amount that Thermo paid for the business and it has about 20% more than the EBITDA now. So, the multiple is lower.
Andrew Buscaglia: Okay. And then if you could turn to Telular. So, it's been about a year since you've owned that asset. Can you provide an update on this specifically with regards to margins, where that was -- that was supposed to be a big part of the story and leveraging it across your entire business. Can you give some examples maybe of where you're going to see that?
Dave Zapico: Yes, that's a great question. Telular is performing well and we're very pleased with the business. They've come into AMETEK with lot of energy in terms of the integration. And we have a process where we're taking that IoT technology to some specific businesses and we've developed a broader thought process of applying it to other businesses within AMETEK that should be aware of the technology. So, it's going very well. We're very pleased with that management team and we're counting on them for 2020. It's going to be one of the drivers for AMETEK.
Andrew Buscaglia: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up question from Robert McCarthy from Stephens. Your line is now open.
Rob McCarthy: Sorry for getting greedy, but a couple of cleanups, if you don't mind. I guess, first, I know, episodically, we went through some of the order rates and some of the organic growth rates. But could we do the in honor of Scott Graham, the state of the Union in terms of where organic growth is across the segments and outlook?
Dave Zapico: Sure thing, Rob. And we've covered a lot of this in the call already, but I'll just go through it all. So be a bit of a rehash. Our process businesses delivered an excellent quarter. We talked about overall mid-teens on a tonnage basis, mid-single-digit organic growth, and we had the acquisitions of Forza, Telular and Spectro Scientific and our Materials Analysis business, again, delivered particularly strong organic growth in the quarter. And they're seeing positive results from the organic growth initiatives. So for all of 2019, we continue to expect our process businesses that have organic sales up in the mid-single-digit range. And we talked a bit about our aerospace business. They performed exceptionally well again in the third quarter was strong and balanced growth across all the businesses. Our overall sales were up high – up 10%, driven by high single-digit organic growth. So we have the contribution from the acquisition of Pacific Design Technologies in there. And similar to the first half, growth in the third quarter was broad-based. And I'd highlight a couple of our businesses, but it was a commercial OEM and third-party MRO, they had very good quarters, and we expect to continue to have mid- to high single-digit organic growth for all of 2019, with balanced growth across each of the markets. And our Power and industrial segment, they were down slightly in the third quarter, driven by weakness in our industrial business. And for all of 2019, we now expect roughly flat organic sales, driven by incremental weakness in our industrial businesses. We had a good, good quarter for our power business improving, but they're industrial power and industrial weakened a bit, and that's what we talked about in the quarter. And our automation and engineered solutions up low single-digits in the quarter. Again, solid growth across engineered solutions, offset by weakness in our automation business. So for all of 2019, we now expect low single-digit organic sales growth for our automation and engineered businesses. And that's around the horn run.
Rob McCarthy: And then just kind of last question, how much was the contribution, and it might have been alluded to, so I'm sorry if it's asked and answered, but how much in third quarter was pricing underlying your organic growth? And what is your embedded expectation for this year?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I think the – our price – we had about two points of price a little better than two points and similar expectation to continue for Q4. Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations for closing remarks.

David Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an excellent second quarter. We exceeded earnings guidance on solid organic sales growth, contributions from acquisitions and exceptional operating performance. In the process, we delivered a record level of sales, EBITDA, operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We also delivered impressive growth in operating cash flow in the quarter. Given the strong results and our outlook for the back half of the year, we have again increased our full year earnings guidance range. These results continue to highlight the strength of the AMETEK Growth Model, and our ability to deliver strong and consistent performance for our shareholders. Now on to the financial highlights for the quarter. Total sales were a record $1.29 billion, up 7% compared to the second quarter of 2018. Organic sales growth was solid at 3%; acquisitions added 5%; and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. EBITDA in the second quarter was a record $349 million, up 10% over the same period in 2018, and EBITDA margins were excellent at 27%. Operating income was a record at $295.4 million, a 9% increase over the second quarter of 2018. Reported operating income margins were up 60 basis points to 22.9%. And excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins increase an impressive 110 basis points over the prior year period. This exceptional operating performance reflects the strength of our operational excellence initiatives. Earnings were a record $1.05 per diluted share, up 14% over the prior year and exceeding our guidance range of $1 to $1.02 per diluted share. Lastly, operating cash flow was superb in the quarter, up 21% to $246 million. Now on to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG second quarter sales were $820.2 million, up 10% over last year's second quarter. Recent acquisitions contributed 8%, organic sales were up 3%, and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. Our Materials Analysis business delivered another very solid quarter. Their high-end analytical instrumentation solutions including several new product introductions are helping our customers solve increasingly complex challenges in attractive growth markets. Our Aerospace business has also performed nicely, as demand remains very solid across the aerospace and defense markets. In addition to the strong top line growth, EIG delivered outstanding operating performance in the second quarter. Operating income increased 10% to $212.9 million with reported operating income margins of 26%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's margins expanded 90 basis points over the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also had a strong quarter, with solid organic sales and impressive operating performance. Second quarter sales for EMG were $469.2 million, up 1% over the same period in 2018. EMG's organic sales growth was 3% and foreign currency a 2 point headwind. EMG's operating performance was excellent with operating income, a record $101.1 million, up 7% over the prior year second quarter. Operating margins for EMG increased sharply to 21.5%, up 120 basis points over the same period last year. AMETEK's results in the second quarter and during the first half of the year were excellent. We are firmly positioned for another year with strong growth and record results. Our highly differentiated businesses continue to execute the AMETEK growth model driving long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. I'd like to highlight some of our businesses, recent accomplishments, and then I'll touch on our updated outlook and guidance for the remainder of the year. First, I would like to congratulate the team at Creaform for recently winning two Red Dot awards for innovative product design of their HandySCAN BLACK and Go!SCAN SPARK metrology products. Launched in April, both new 3D scanners were designed with enhanced features and a sleek new ergonomic design. Now in a third-generation, the HandySCAN BLACK has been optimized to meet the designs, meet the needs of design manufacturing and metrology professionals looking for the most effective and reliable way to acquire accurate 3D measurements of physical objects. The HandySCAN BLACK provides highly accurate and repeatable results even in difficult environments and with complex surfaces. The Go!SCAN SPARK offers the fastest and most friendly 3D scanning experience in the market. Designed to scan any object without need for a setup, it offers flawless texture and geometry acquisition as well as impressive details in rich color palette. The Red Dot Award is a world-renowned competition that is used to identify the most innovative new products across several product categories. I also like to congratulate our Dunkermotoren business for winning the Maschinenmarkt's Best of Industry award for their BG 95 dPro servo motor solution. Dunkermotoren is a global leader in advanced motion control solution serving a broad set of end markets including medical, laboratory, factory automation and motor applications. Their BG 95 dPro sets the standard and integrated servo motors with improved flexibility, functionality, precision and operational reliability. The Red Dot and Best of Industry awards and the success of these new products are testaments to the strength of our new product development teams. So congratulations to everyone at Creaform and Dunkermotoren for these outstanding recognitions. We remain committed to investing in our research and development efforts to provide a leading edge innovative products and technologies to our customers. In 2019, we expect to spend approximately $260 million on RD&E, up 30% over last year's level, and we are seeing excellent results and our new product vitality index was a very strong 25% in the quarter. Now shifting to operational excellence. Our operational excellence tools are adding significant value for our businesses. We continue to drive efficiency improvements across our operation to enhance our profitability improved cash flow, as was evident in our operating performance during the second quarter. For all of 2019, we now expect approximately $85 million in savings from our operational excellence initiatives with the majority of these savings generated for material sourcing. This is an increase from our previous estimate of $80 million in annual savings. Finally, we remained very active yet disciplined in our acquisition efforts. Our business development teams continue to manage a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities. AMETEK remains focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on value-enhancing acquisitions. I will now move to the updated earnings guidance for 2019. Given our performance in the second quarter and our near record backlog, we now expect 2019 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.04 to $4.10, up 10% to 12% over 2018 earnings. This new guidance range has increased from our previous guidance range of $3.98 to $4.08 per diluted share. We continue to expect overall sales for the year to be up high single digit with organic sales up 3% to 5%. Overall sales in the third quarter are expected to be up high single digit. Earnings for the third quarter are anticipated to be in the range of $1 to $1.02 per diluted share, up 10% to 12% over the prior year period. To summarize, we are pleased with our second quarter results. We remain focused on driving continued growth through the end of the year and well into the future. Our business' market leading differentiated technologies and their execution of the AMETEK Growth Model are driving strong results for our stakeholders. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then, we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted AMETEK had an excellent second quarter, capping off the first half of the year with record results. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Core selling expense in the second quarter was roughly in line with last year's second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were up slightly over the same period in 2018, and as a percentage of sales were 1.4% versus last year's level of 1.5%. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.4%, down from last year's second quarter tax rate of 21.9%. For 2019, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, and as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Working capital was 18.3% in the second quarter, essentially unchanged from the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $22 million in the quarter and for the full year of 2019 we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million or 1.9% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $57 million. For the full year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $235 million including acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $130 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Our businesses continue to generate very strong levels of cash flow. Second quarter operating cash flow was $246 million, up 21% over last year's second quarter, and free cash flow was $224 million, up 20% over last year. As a percentage of net income, free cash flow conversion was 104% and we continue to expect full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% of net income. The primary use of our strong free cash flow is to support our acquisition efforts. And as Dave just noted, our pipeline remains healthy, and we have significant financial flexibility to continue our acquisition strategy. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $2.47 billion, down from $2.63 billion at the end of 2018. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $568 million, resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio as of June 30th of 1.4 times. We remain well positioned to support our growth initiatives with approximately $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities. To conclude, our businesses delivered outstanding performance with high quality results in the second quarter. Our outlook remains positive through the back half of 2019 given our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?
David Zapico: Great. Thank you, Bill. Kevin, can we please open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.
Matt Summerville: Thanks. Couple of questions. First, can you give us a little color on where incoming order rates organically were for the total company and by business? And also just given the macro choppiness out there, can you talk about what sort of linearity you saw during the quarter, and what you're seeing thus far in your business in July?
David Zapico: Sure, Matt. In terms of orders, Q2 orders were up 4% and organic orders were flat, a very slightly positive. In our EIG business, the order rates were in line with the organic sales growth in the quarter, and the EMG orders were down a bit. We had some delays in our automation and engineered solution businesses. And we ended the quarter with a near record backlog of $1.7 billion. And in terms of the order patterns and sales patterns during the quarter, they followed a similar trend. We had - May was a bit better than April, and June was a bit better than May, which is very typical for our business, but the growth each month as it stepped up was more subdued than past quarter. So pretty typical, but a little less of a ramp.
Matt Summerville: And then, maybe as a follow-up, where were you in the quarter on price versus inflation? Thanks.
David Zapico: Sure, Matt. Sure. Q2 was much like the second half of '18, and the first quarter of '19. We had an excellent quarter. We achieved 2 points of price across our entire portfolio. Total inflation, the impact of tariffs was a bit less than 1.5%. So we had a positive spread and we're very pleased with the results. As you know, the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of AMETEK's product portfolio. We have leadership positions in niche markets around the globe, and we really have some focus and determination to make sure we stay in front of a changing global environment. So we're very pleased with the results.
Matt Summerville: Thank you, David.
David Zapico: Thank you, Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.
Nigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. I thought it maybe a good time to perhaps run through the end markets and the geographies in a bit more detail?
David Zapico: Right. Sure thing, Nigel. First, on our market segment commentary, I'll start with our process businesses. They had another excellent quarter with overall sales up low teens on a percentage basis, driven by mid single-digit organic sales growth, and contributions from the acquisitions of Forza, Telular and Spectro Scientific. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the Materials Analysis business had a particularly strong organic growth quarter driven by solid new product introductions and solid demand for their high-end instrumentation, and for all the 29 we continue to expect process organic sales to be up mid single digits. Switch to aerospace, our aerospace and defense businesses delivered another excellent quarter with high single digit organic sales growth. This growth reflects the attractive positions we have across a diverse set of aerospace and different defense platforms. Similar to the first quarter, growth in the second quarter was broad based across our various aerospace markets. We had a notable strength in our commercial OEM and third-party MRO businesses. And given the solid start to the year, we're increasing our expectations for aerospace and now expect mid to high single digit organic sales growth for all of 2019 with balanced growth across each market. Our power and industrial segment, in the second quarter, sales were up low single digits, driven by the contribution from the recent acquisition of Motec. Organic sales were down slightly in the quarter and in line with our expectations. For all of 2019, we continue to expect low to mid single digit organic sales growth given the strength of our backlog and solid order patterns in these businesses. And finally, sales of our automation and engineered solutions businesses were up low single digits for the second quarter against the difficult prior year comp. For all the 2019, we now expect low to mid single digit organic sales growth for automation and engineered solutions, and we are seeing some order delays in certain businesses. So we lowered that automation and engineered solutions segment from mid to low to mid, and we increased our aerospace guide to a bit or so. So I'll just summarize the whole thing, further continue to expect overall full year organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. As I said, we have modestly increased growth forecast for aerospace, while modestly decreasing our growth forecast for automation and engineered solutions. And really no change to process and power and industrial and OEM, but process performed very well in the quarter, and they look strong.
Nigel Coe: Great. Thanks, David. And maybe if you could just touch on what you've seen in China. Perhaps just address the 3% to 5% organic implies some acceleration in the back half of the year to get to the high end of that range. What gives you confidence that that can accelerate on tougher comps in the back half of the year? Thank you very much.
David Zapico: Yes, sure. Right. Yes, we had overall sales ended up within our guidance range, and organic sales ended up within our guidance range. And at the half year, we were at 4%. So right smack that middle in our guidance. So in terms of geography, we saw some solid growth across Europe and the U.S., and Asia was down mid-single digit. So you really have about 80% of our business up mid single digits, and Asia which is about 18% of our business was down mid single digits. We see in the U.S. where we were up mid single digits, the strongest growth was at process and our aerospace businesses. In Europe, we were up mid single digits. We had broad-based growth in oil and gas, and aerospace had particularly strong quarters. And Asia was down mid single digits, and China was down a bit more than mid single digit. So we had some down a bit more after two plus years of very strong growth, but it's about 7% of our sales, and clearly they are being impacted by the number one and number two economies in the trade war. So we're watching that closely, but given its relative size, it hasn't been too much of a headwind yet.
Nigel Coe: Thanks, David.
Thanks, David.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.
David Zapico: Good morning.
Josh Pokrzywinski: I guess just to follow up on the last question, thinking about some of the end markets that are doing better or ones that we got a little softer. And Dave, I think, is it a fair characterization to say, some of the longer cycle stuff aerospace process is really what gives you the visibility in the guide and the confidence in the second half? And the shorter cycle end markets in automation are, I guess, what's holding you back, but can also turn quickly. Is that a fair characterization as a starting point?
David Zapico: Yes, I'd say that's a fair characterization. In our automation businesses, we're dealing with OEM customers and they delayed placing orders in the quarter. We didn't lose these orders, they are delayed, and they're cautious, but there is a healthy order pipeline. So I would say that's a good characterization with we have strengthen in aerospace and solid with process and some weakness in automation. So that's a good summary.
Josh Pokrzywinski: So I think in the automation space, a lot of folks in that orbit have called out auto and electronics has been kind of the two biggest headwinds. Is that safe to say, it's the same end markets for you guys? Or is there something else that's cropped up within that?
David Zapico: Yes, I would say, it's - we have some motive customers there and that was weaker and there was some factor automation customers that was weaker, and to balance that there were some medical and food industry automation that we're okay with, so -- but those are OEM customers, and the motive and factory automation were the areas that it was a bit light.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then just one last one for me. Obviously with the string of acquisitions over the last couple of years, a bit more diversity in the portfolio and some deeper niches, how are those performed or have you even noticed the change in the growth rates or performance as some of the macro has gotten a bit choppier?
David Zapico: Yes. One of the characteristics of the acquisitions we did over the past two years were they were largely U.S.-based, and they've held up very well. So the acquisitions are performing extremely well, and they're meeting their acquisition models and is driving the performance of the company as you can see in the results.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.
David Zapico: Thanks, Josh.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
David Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Yes. Good morning. Just a question, did I hear correctly that China was down in the quarter? I apologize if I missed that.
David Zapico: Yes. What we went through, the geographies were up in the U.S., mid single digits, down in Europe, mid single digit - excuse me, up in U.S., up in Europe, mid single digits, down in Asia mid-single digits, and China was down a bit more than Asia.
Andrew Obin: Right. So the question on China, I'm just wondering, could you just walk us what happened in the quarter in China because my sense was that the Chinese business very nichey, you have a lot of growth initiatives there. And just trying to get a sense when did it turn in the quarter or if you have this granularity on the call?
David Zapico: Yes. China has been very choppy and inconsistent through the balance of this year. We do have - we had very difficult comps that we were running into there. So it was mainly in our automation business where we saw weakness, but it was - in China it was more broad based, a lot of the businesses were down a bit. So, again, it was a difficult comp, and I think they're just dealing with the uncertainty and a trade war, and we've been watching it closely, and it's 7% of our business. And fortunately, we have about 80% of our business growing mid single digit. So it's been inconsistent, that's the best way to describe it, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Yes. No, of course. And just a broader question, I think, others have tried to sort of get to the question. If I look at your peers, most of them actually did cut organic growth outlook. If I look at the historical relationship between your revenue growth and industrial production, your guidance does imply that things are different. You did highlight more North American acquisitions over the past couple of years. But could you also talk about the impact of the growth initiatives, because I know Dave, when we meet with AMETEK folks, they're really highlighting, how are you pivoting more to growth. Anyway you can quantify what the growth initiatives doing to cyclicality of the growth profile of AMETEK, that will be terrific? Thank you.
David Zapico: Yes, sure. When I think about our portfolio, we had the U.S.-based acquisitions over the past year, but we also have about 13% of our business now is health care. And our aerospace business is performing well. So those are all things that are driving us right now. And when I look at the -- we definitely have improved our organic growth capability. We're making great progress as you saw when you visited some of our operation. There is -- the teams are excited and we're seeing positive results. But I don't think that, that is very difficult to quantify that. And we will be using the tools and the way we have talked about it is through the cycle we will get a point better of organic growth. So I'm not sure in the current environment. It's pretty -- you can draw a distinction between what we've done in organic growth and the current results.
Andrew Obin: Terrific. Thank you very much.
David Zapico: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
David Zapico: Hello, Deane.
Deane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, maybe we can start with price cost in the quarter. How did that play out in expectations for the second half and what role tariffs had?
David Zapico: Great. Yes, I think, I'll start with the tariffs. And as you know, we're comprised of niche differentiated businesses and we have low CapEx by design. So our model gives us a lot of flexibility in dealing with those situations. And in Q2, the situation played out as we predicted. We had about $0.01 from the direct impact of tariffs and we offset that completely with price. So -- and we're expecting a similar level of activity in the second half of the year. And going back to the price question, Q2 '19 was much like the second half of '18, and the first quarter of '19. We had an excellent quarter. We achieved 2% of price across our entire business, that's both in EIG and EMG. Total inflation and the impact of tariffs added together was a bit less than 1.5%. So, we had a good contribution to margin from our price less total inflation and tariffs and we're very pleased with the results.
Deane Dray: It's all great to hear. And then in the verticals and the end markets, did I hear you comment on oil and gas? How did that...
David Zapico: No, we didn't -- yes, we didn't comment. Oil and gas had a particularly strong quarter in Europe, and we include the Middle East in Europe. And when you look at the whole segment, it was up 10% in Q2. So, good strong organic growth in both our upstream and mid and downstream businesses, and we were pleased with the performance.
Deane Dray: Good. And then on the opening question, I might have -- with Matt, I might have missed the answer, he asked about how July had looked?
David Zapico: Right. Yes, I don't think - yes, we covered the quarter. We talked about the quarter being -- and increased each month, but it was more subdued for us. And in July, we're right on our plan, so July isn't over, but we're on target. So July feels pretty good.
Deane Dray: All good to hear. Thank you.
David Zapico: Thank you, Deane.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.
David Zapico: Hello, Rob.
Robert McCarthy: Can you hear me?
David Zapico: Yes.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for the time, and congratulations on a good quarter. I guess the first question I would have is around your incremental margins. On a core basis, could you talk through that, just excluding acquisition and some of the distortions we might see there?
William Burke: Right. We're very pleased with our margin performance in the quarter. Our core margins were excellent. The EIG, if you take out the acquisitions, it was up 90 basis points, and EMG, where there wasn't acquisitions was up 120 basis points. So just outstanding margins, outstanding operating performance, and it showed up in the incrementals also. We had core incrementals of about 60%, EIG was about 50% and EMG was about 70%. So excellent operating performance around the world.
Robert McCarthy: Now, definitely, could you speak just stepping back on the performance on the cash cycle and cash generation in more of your aerospace, and while you probably have very little explicit defense exposure. But your aerospace and longer cycle businesses in terms of how you do there, in terms of free cash flow generation conversion or operating cash flow typically, is that below or above the company average?
David Zapico: Yes. The aerospace business is a great cash generator for us. So, I would say, it's - in terms of the various components of working capital, aerospace ends up being a little higher as a percentage of sales because they're dealing with the aftermarket and -- but they are higher margin businesses. So you have higher working capital, but higher margins, and that's characteristic of the aerospace business, and it's been that way for a long time.
Robert McCarthy: Yes, it's nice to have a good cash generation. The final question is just looking at the environment you're seeing right now, obviously went through a kind of a rocky road and kind of the '14 to '16 time frame with deflation, oil and gas kind of contraction, and it led to some challenging organic growth and also some restructuring, right? Do you think we're going to anticipate given what we're seeing right now over the next 12 months to 18 months incremental restructuring from you guys?
David Zapico: At AMETEK, we are in our various businesses. We're always doing some level of restructuring and those are reported in the operating results. In terms of our big restructuring, our realignment activity affected the entire company. Right now we're not seeing that, we're pretty confident around the second half of the year. But if things change, then we're good at doing it, and we have plenty of opportunities to drive cost reduction. So, as I sit here with a solid group of businesses, generating cash flow, margin expansion, with a robust backlog of deals, with a strong balance sheet, I feel very optimistic about AMETEK's performance and being able to outperform the current environment.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for your time.
David Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.
Brett Linzey: Hey, good morning, guys.
David Zapico: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Linzey: Hey, just a question pertaining to some of the recent portfolio moves, if -- and in recent, I mean, you know, 2017, 2018 acquisitions, if we were to drill down and look at the recurring element or the aftermarket element as a percent of sales of those businesses, how does that mix look of those acquired assets versus the legacy portfolio? You're actually mixing up with the stickier revenue base…
David Zapico: Yes, we are mixing up, and when we announced those deals, we address the recurring revenue, you know Telular stands out. It is about two-thirds of the business that's recurring, but many of the businesses like Spectro Scientific was 30%, 40%, and so we're mixing up and the recurring baseline of AMETEK, it was about 20%, but our recent acquisitions have been a bit more than that.
Brett Linzey: Okay. Great. And then if we continue to see this industrial slowdown, historically you've talked about incrementals on the way up of 30% to 35%. If we flip that script and think about potential downside what type of decremental preservation do you see if we get into an environment where sales are declining modestly? And then I guess a follow-on there, are there any countermeasure plans in place that can help you get a cost relatively quickly if things do turn a little bit south here?
David Zapico: Right. Yes, as you know, we have high contribution margins in our business, very profitable businesses, but we also have excellent operating capability, and we have seasoned general managers that know how to operate both in up cycles and down cycles. And clearly going into a down cycle, we have plenty of opportunities and plenty of projects, and we have the ability to pull those forward, and we're also very good at managing our working capital and generate a lot of cash. So if we get into that environment, it's an environment where we're experienced and we will perform well on a relative basis, but right at this point we're not seeing that.
Brett Linzey: But based on some of those actions or what's been in motion, I mean do you think you can preserve a decremental margin much less than 30%?
David Zapico: Yes. I think it's definitely, but again when something like that happens, it depends on where it comes from and...
William Burke: The depth of it.
David Zapico: And the depth of degrowth is a good comment. So we have to look at it. If that happens when it comes, and I'm sure there will be another recession and I'm sure we'll manage our way through very well.
Brett Linzey: Okay. Great, guys. Thanks.
David Zapico: Thanks, Brent.
Operator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning.
David Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: Just want to follow along on that operational excellence kind of theme. You did increase your operation excellence savings for 2019. Can you talk with just sort of a natural fallout of where some of these programs ended or ending or is it some acceleration in certain areas?
David Zapico: We're seeing acceleration. I mean the -- at the beginning of the year, we had about $80 million of operational excellence savings, and $60 million of it was from sourcing, and $20 million of it was from other projects that we had. And what we're really seeing is an acceleration on the sourcing side. So our sourcing teams are doing an outstanding job, absolutely outstanding job of dealing with the mitigation of tariffs, and moving us to different regions of the world and delivering incremental savings. So really the incremental savings from sourcing was increased from $60 million to $65 million, and that drove the operational excellence savings increase from $80 million to $85 million. And that savings are in the P&L for 2019 and we saw -- that's a ratable kind of thing, and we saw it ramp up from Q1 to Q2, so we're very confident in the second half of that.
Allison Poliniak: Great. And then I may have missed it, the aerospace increase in growth for that sector. Was there a specific sub segment there or region that's driving that increased growth relative to your expectations?
David Zapico: Yes, we have a -- if you look at the business jet market, the business jet market was up low double digits, and coming off a pretty easy comp, but it's continuing to perform. So the military market, the third-party MRO had a fantastic quarter in the second quarter, the commercial business continued strong, so it was really the entire market that did well. But if you look into the details, the business jet market ticked up and we improved the guidance for that for the year. But the entire aerospace business, we increased mid to high single digits.
Allison Poliniak: Great. Thanks so much.
David Zapico: Thanks, Allison.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning.
David Zapico: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn: Hey, Dave. So I think you mentioned $2 billion cash and available credit. I think it's the first quarter in a little while you didn't talk about a couple of new bolt-ons, I know. They don't come every quarter, but just an update, is the pipeline still very vibrant?
David Zapico: It is. It is. You know, Chris, we had a record Q4 2018, where we closed three deals and spent about $750 million. And our pipeline is very good, and we're evaluating a number of opportunities. And as you know, it's difficult to predict when they're going to happen in the short-term, but I feel very confident in the long-term and our capability in this area, and have a strong balance sheet. So we're very optimistic that we're going to be able to deploy our free cash flow on acquisitions in the long-term. Right now, we're being disciplined. I mean, we're looking at a lot of properties, and we do deal, we're going to get you return on capital.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks for that. And on the outlook, generally calling for continuity versus the macros clearly weakening, I understand you don't have much distribution, you're much more direct. So that's clearly an advantage you have in the current environment. But are we moving into a phase where backlog conversion picks up to kind of preserve that organic continuity? Just want a little more kind of complexion around that.
David Zapico: Yes, we have a near-record backlog of $1.7 billion, which gives us some confidence in the second half. And if you look into that backlog, there are some opportunities to convert some of it. So that's one of the reasons that we're confident in the guidance in the second half. We're performing well, we got our aerospace growth, our process business is doing well, the U.S. market has done extremely well, and we got a solid backlog and that provides conversion opportunities. So that's the way we're looking at it and we feel good about it.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. Thanks for that.
David Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys, good morning.
David Zapico: Hey, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Hey, Bill, just one quick clarification. The tax rate was a little light in the quarter, anything specific going on there? And I know you gave the full year, but I missed it. What's your view for that?
William Burke: Full year is now 21%. What we saw in the quarter was about 150 basis points down year-over-year. Benefits from -- excess tax benefits from stock compensation, and as well there was some changes in some state tax laws that help us drive that rate down to 20.4% in the second quarter.
Joe Giordano: And 21% good forward number to use like out into the model, too?
William Burke: We're looking at a number that's probably to get to the average of 21% for the year, it's more of 22% in the back half of the year.
Joe Giordano: I mean more so like a full year going forward like into 2020, is like a 21% a fair number to use?
William Burke: That's -- we'll be working to get to that level next year.
Joe Giordano: Okay. So we've kind of got through this a couple of times, asked different ways. As top line starts to slow a bit maybe we're -- we're still in the same organic range, but maybe we're talking more midpoint or lower, and early in the year, maybe we're talking midpoint or higher. Particularly in markets like maybe heavy truck where there is some obvious declines probably coming up, are you like teeing up anything here to take some actions? And along the same lines, your cost out this year really strong sourcing accelerating, what's the opportunity set look like into next year for your cost out broadly?
David Zapico: Right. The opportunity set is very good to -- at all times. As part of our strategic planning process, we go through with all of our business. They have a three-year plan for cost reductions, and involve sourcing some plant consolidations and everything. We have a viable set of projects to pull from. So we really have some opportunities to do that. But when you mention the trucking marker, that business is now less than 2% of sales and the mix...
William Burke: Definitely, yes.
David Zapico: Yes, we bought Motec earlier in the year and they are in the really good business, and that business is actually growing. So it mutes any decline that we have in the other part of the business. So we have a situation where we've been modifying our portfolio over time, and there we have a good growth. And the camera and the algorithms, software of the vehicles, and really it has changed the outlook for that part of the business. So, you have a little bit of portfolio work that's going on, and we still feel good for the second half. I mean your point is valid maybe for more toward the midpoint and/or the low end and high end, but we're at 4% through the half year, right in the middle of our guide, and we feel confident for the second half of the year.
Joe Giordano: So, I guess, what I'm getting at -- I know that you're not -- I know that you're looking forward, and you're not sitting on your hands as things start to weaken from a macros perspective. Earlier in the year, orders growing 12% organically, or like last year orders growing 12% organically in the first quarter, and now we're at flat. So how are you just -- I'm guessing like the decisions are somewhat different now. So how are you acting differently than maybe you were a year ago or something like that?
David Zapico: Yes, I just point you to margins. And we really have some seasoned operators in our businesses, and they are reacting to their plan. So when their business has softened, they're adjusting their cost structures. And with our -- you saw excellent core incrementals in the quarter, you saw excellent operating income. On a reported basis, we are up 60 basis points after we did a bunch of dilutive deals. And without the acquisitions, we were at 110 basis points. So I think the AMETEK operational excellence is really working for you, and there is plenty of room to go and a long runway to that.
Joe Giordano: Great. Thanks, guys.
David Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to our host.
David Zapico: Great. Thank you, Kevin, for all your help, and thank you everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of today's webcast will be available on our website shortly. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s presentation. You may disconnect. And have a wonderful day.+

We will begin today’s call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then open it up for your questions. I will now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK began 2019 with an outstanding first quarter, establishing records for sales, orders, backlog, EBITDA and operating income. Our businesses delivered strong overall sales growth, with solid organic growth and meaningful contribution from the six acquisitions we completed in 2018. Our business has also deliver fantastic operating performance, with impressive operating income growth in core margin expansion leading to 15% adjusted earnings growth which nicely exceeded our expectations. We also generated strong cash flow, with operating cash flow increasing 11% year-over-year. Given these strong results, we have increased our earnings guidance for 2019. Now onto the financial highlights for the quarter. Total sales in the first quarter were $1.29 billion, up 10% compared to the first quarter of 2018. Organic sales growth was again strong at 5%, with acquisitions adding 7% and foreign currency at 2-point headwind. We also generated a record level of orders in the first quarter, with another quarter of positive book-to-bill. Our record backlog of $1.7 billion provides a solid visibility as we move through 2019. EBITDA in the first quarter was a record $337 million, up 10% over the same period in 2018 and EBITDA margins were excellent at 26.2%. Operating income in the quarter was a record at $283.3 million, up 10% over the prior year period, with the reported operating margins of 22%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins increased an impressive 70 basis points over 2018 first quarter. Adjusted earnings were $1 per share, up 15% over the comparable basis for 2018, exceeding our guidance range of $0.95 per diluted share to $0.97 per diluted share. Now turning to the first quarter results of the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group, EIG sales in the quarter increased 13% to $806.9 million. Recent acquisitions contributed 10% and organic sales growth was up 4%. Foreign currency was a 2-point headwind. Our Materials Analysis businesses continued to deliver strong growth as their high end analytical instrumentation solutions are very well-positioned in attractive growth markets. EIG’s operating performance in the quarter was outstanding, with operating income of $203.1 million, up 11% over 2018’s first quarter. Reported operating income margins were 25.2%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG margins expanded an impressive 110 basis points over the prior year’s first quarter. The Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter, with strong organic sales growth and excellent operating performance. EMG’s first quarter sales increased 5% to a record $480.8 million with organic sales growth a very strong 7%. The acquisition of FMH added 1% and foreign currency was a 2-point headwind. We continue to see broad based growth across our Automation, Engineered Materials and Aerospace and Defense businesses, each the continuing to deliver solid growth. EMG also delivered excellent operating performance in the quarter, with operating income increasing 9% to $98.8 million. Operating margins expanded nicely up 70 basis points to 20.6%. I am very pleased with the AMETEK’s first quarter performance, which has positioned us very well for another year of record results. The AMETEK growth model which combines our four growth strategies, with a disciplined focus on cash generation, capital deployment and talent development continues to provide the framework for driving long-term and sustainable value for our shareholders. Before, I discuss our updated outlook for 2019, I wanted to highlight some of the recent achievements of our colleagues have had in driving success for AMETEK. I will start with the collaborative R&D effort between two of our businesses, which resulted in the release of two innovative new products. In March, EDAX, a leading provider of materials characterization systems unveiled is Velocity Plus and Velocity Super models. The Velocity Super at 4,500 frames per second is the fastest electron batch diffraction camera system in the world. Both new velocity systems are powered by high-speed, low noise, CMOS sensors developed by our Vision Research business, a leading provider of ultra high-speed cameras. These new additions to the EDAX portfolio offers our customers a superior solution to help solve materials characterization and elemental composition challenges in both R&D and broader industrial settings. Congratulations to the EDAX and Vision Research teams for coming together and developing these world-class new products. This is just one example of the many market leading new products and solutions our businesses are developing to help solve our customers’ most complex challenges. Our businesses are also capturing additional market share by expanding into attractively positioned adjacent markets. Rauland, a leading provider of communication systems for use in hospitals and healthcare facilities has a renewed focus on expanding its technology offering to serve schools and educational institutions. Through its Telecenter U, Rauland provides school districts and campuses with flexible, streamlined communication capabilities for its students and staff. Utilizing a suite of proprietary hardware and software applications, Telecenter U synchronizes mass communications across multiple locations for everyday messages, event scheduling and in critical emergency situations. The solution can play a key role in helping to improve the safety and security of students and teachers during crisis situations, and it is designed to help automate and manage our schools crisis plan during the crucial first few minutes before first responders arrive. Rauland has done an excellent job expanding its technology focus on safety within our schools. We will continue to invest our new product development and market expansion initiatives as we are seeing outstanding results from these investments. Our teams are also doing incredible job integrating our recent acquisitions into AMETEK. In 2018, we deployed over $1.1 billion of capital on fixed acquisitions and acquired approximately $350 million in annual sales. These acquisitions are already showing strong performance, and we expect them to generate excellent results in 2019. We remain focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions. While we are aggressively pursuing these opportunities, we will remain disciplined on our acquisition efforts. Our teams are actively pursuing a broad pipeline of opportunities, and we are confident that we will be able to continue to complete value enhancing acquisitions. Finally, we continue to focus on driving operational excellence, the corner store of the AMETEK growth model. In the first quarter, we generated strong savings from our operational excellence initiatives, largely resulting from our global sourcing and strategic determined activities. For all of 2019, we expect to generate over $80 million in operational excellence savings. We remain focused on developing and enhancing continuous improvement processes to drive positive operating results in 2019 and beyond. Now moving to our updated outlook. Given our performance in the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect 2019 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.98 to $4.08 per diluted share, an increase of 9% to 11% over the comparable basis in 2018. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share. We continue to expect overall sales in 2019 to be up high single digits with organic sales up 3% to 5%. In the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up high single digits and adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1 to $1.02 per diluted share, a 9% to 11% increase over the prior year period. To summarize, our businesses outperformance in the first quarter firmly positions AMETEK for another year of strong growth. Our experienced management teams, our market-leading niche businesses and the proven growth model allows AMETEK to deliver strong and consistent performance. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter and then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave just mentioned, AMETEK began the year with excellent performance delivering record results that exceeded our expectations. I will now provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter. Core selling expenses in the quarter was up in line with the core sales growth. First quarter general and administrative expenses were up $2.4 million over the same period in 2018 due largely to higher compensation costs. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.4%, in line with last year’s level. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.5%, down from last year’s first quarter rate of 23.1%. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5%. And as we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Working capital on the quarter was 18.2%, up versus the prior year due to large parts of the impact from the acquisitions in 2018. Capital expenditures were $21 million for the first quarter. And for 2019, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million, or 1.9% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $58 million. And for the full year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $235 million, including acquisition related intangible amortization of approximately $130 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $196 million, up 11% over last year’s first quarter and free cash flow was $175 million. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.47 billion, down $160 million from $2.63 billion at the end of 2018. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $368 million, resulting in a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of March 31 of 1.6 times. We remain well positioned to support our growth initiatives with more than $1.8 billion of cash and existing credit facilities. To conclude, our businesses started the year with outstanding performance delivering high quality results. Our outlook for 2019 remains positive given our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Great, thank you, Bill. Sydney, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
Kevin Coleman: Good morning, Matt. How are you there?
Dave Zapico: Sydney, why don’t we move on to the next call?
Matt Summerville: Hello
Kevin Coleman: Matt are you there?
Matt Summerville: Yes. Can you hear me?
Kevin Coleman: Yes, now, yes.
Matt Summerville: Yes. I am sorry. I don’t know what have them there. Anyways, Could you maybe comment as to the linearity you saw in your business throughout the quarter, anything unusual across the three regions? And then maybe give a little regional color around the 5% organic growth sort of what was better, what was worse?
David Zapico: Right. I will start with the geographic update. And there was a dynamic in one of our regions that was a little bit different, so I will talk about that also. In the U.S., there was a strong high single-digit growth. It was a broad-based growth, particularly in our Aerospace business, our Process businesses and our EMIP business. It really fired on all cylinders. Europe was a pleasant surprise, up mid-single digits, a solid growth in automation and Process businesses drove that growth. And Asia was roughly flat. And also there was a dynamic where the activities seemed to slow in February, but it picked up very strongly in March. So some of our folks were speculating that some of the uncertainty or the Chinese New Year may have slowed our business activity. But again in March, we ended up with a record order input for Asia. So it was flat, but going forward, we haven’t changed any of our outlook for the region. So across-the-board, it was pretty good quarter.
Matt Summerville: And then just lastly, Dave, can you maybe comment on where you were in Q1 with price realization and how that compared to inflation?
David Zapico: Yes. Matt, I didn’t answer your linearity question. I mean, we strengthened through the quarter and our strongest month was March, which is not atypical for us. And related to the price inflation, Q1 ‘19 was much like the second half of 2018. We had an excellent quarter. We achieved about 2 percentage points of price across our entire business. Total inflation was a bit less than 1.5%. So we are very pleased with these results, and we think we are well positioned to continue this for the balance of 2019. That speaks to the, as I said before, the highly differentiated nature of our product portfolio on our leadership positions in these niche markets. And also our focus and determination to stay ahead of the inflation in a changing global economic environment.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Andrew Obin: Yes, Just maybe a basic question, but just looking at the seasonality, given what the first quarter was, usually first quarter for you is quite a bit couple of percentage points less than 25%. And I guess, second quarter guide and the annual guide implies that on a seasonal basis, second half is going to be weaker than usual, just looking back 10 years. And I was just wondering if you are seeing any yellow flags that are driving this kind of caution, or you are just being conservative?
Bill Burke: Yes, it’s a great question, Andrew. I mean, the first point is, in quarter 2, our guide is higher than quarter 1. So we typically -- from Q1 to Q2, it’s a bit higher. And we grew sales organically at the high-end of our guidance range. And in the first quarter, we had excellent core margin performance. And we raised our guidance letting the entire Q1 earnings to be flowed through to the new guide. But to your final point, it’s still early in the year. And we feel good about how the quarter played out, but we are being a bit prudent. And the uncertainty of the economic environment and we feel that we are very comfortable with our guidance.
Andrew Obin: And just a follow-up question. I guess since 2014, we have been sort of waiting for big come back for your Energy business. And if you can just comment what WTI being north of 60, are you seeing any change in tone from your customers to that point that maybe it would finally really take off where it’s just going to be steady climb as it used to be?
Bill Burke: Sure. The Energy business is probably a bit smaller as a percentage of total AMETEK because of some of the organic growth we have had in other areas and our M&A. It’s about 6% of the company and in the first quarter, it was up low single digits and for the full year, we are expecting it to be up mid-single digits. And we are looking at our -- for the full year, we are looking at our upstream business to be high single digits and the mid-downstream to be up mid-single digits. And we have about 75% of our business in the mid and downstream. And what we are starting to see is typical recovery, that part of the business, our largest part of businesses starting to gain momentum. So we feel very good about our energy business. We feel really good about the market positions we have and the businesses continuing to grow. We had a great year last year and it looks like it’s on target for another good year this year.
Andrew Obin: But any near-term change in behavior as the oil price rallied in the past 3 months?
Bill Burke: We have solid backlogs, but I can’t say that there was a change -- a notable change in behavior when the price of oil raised the last few months and there wasn’t a change of behavior when it dropped precipitously in Q4. We just had a steady increasing level of business and it’s a global business about 2/3 of outside the U.S. and it just feels really solid. And as I said, the mid and downstream business is picking up nicely.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Bhupender Bohra: This is Bhupender here sitting in for Nigel. So Dave, you mentioned about the core orders in the quarter, can you give us some color on the core orders numbers for the whole company as well as EIG and EMG? And just wanted to talk about some of the end markets, which kind of strengthened or weakened during the quarter or you actually see from a color especially in April what we are seeing here?
David Zapico: Sure, Bhupender. The first thing would be the organic orders. They were up 3.5% for the quarter. That’s actually -- remember against a very difficult comp at -- we were up plus 12% in Q1 of 2018. So really solid orders performance, we had excellent book-to-bill. Our book-to-bill was 1.07. I think this mark 10 straight quarters with a positive book-to-bill. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $1.7 billion. So we are feeling really good about environment we are operating in and from what we are hearing from our businesses, and we continue to see a solid underlying demand. We are really well positioned to perform well in this environment. And regarding April, I haven’t seen the data as of today, but I have seen it as of yesterday, and we are right on track. So no change in pace in April, and we are feeling good about Q2.
Bhupender Bohra: And just a question on your guidance for the second quarter. The sales are going to grow up high single, do you have the organic growth number? Like what of kind of organic is built in those numbers?
David Zapico: The organic growth would be the same level at the 3%, 4%, 5% that we have guided for the year for AMETEK.
Bhupender Bohra: So it’s within the range, okay, got it. And lastly, on the -- you talked a little bit about the M&A pipeline, you guys did a great job like deploying up, Bill, more than $1 billion here over the last -- in 2018. Any color on the size, at least the pipeline, EIG, EMGs, how it’s kind of mix wise as well as maybe just give us around the hone kind of color on M&A.
Bill Burke: Yes, sure on M&A. Our M&A pipeline is very active. As always, we are evaluating a number of opportunities. And we have a very broad pipeline, it needs to be broad. Because we are in the environment with the oil pricing up and with the competitiveness of the environment, we have to select the deals from our broad pipeline, which will give us a solid return on capital. So the M&A environment is similar to what we have been experiencing in the past few years, and we are looking at deals across both of our groups. And I am very encouraged with the progress on the pipeline. And you can’t predict in the next quarter if the deal is going to close, but I feel very confident on the long term with our process capability in M&A and with our tremendous pipeline. So I am very bullish about M&A.
Bhupender Bohra: And lastly, it’s on the Aerospace, I just want to leave at this. Any -- if you can explain the exposure on the 737 Max here, anything on that front? And any pressure from the down tick on the production especially from the Boeing?
David Zapico: Right, as you know, AMETEK is not dependent on any one platform. So we are on lot of or on just about every platform, but we are not overly dependent on anyone. So when you look at the 737 issue, first of all, Boeing hasn’t reduced the orders forecast and production plan that we are seeing here. So we are still going along meeting that demand. The second point would be for the full year of 2019, the 737 Max accounts for about $15 million in revenue. So that puts it in an order of magnitude. It’s a small part of the company, I think, probably about 0.25% of revenue. So we are not overly dependent on it. We certainly want to see the problem fixed and want to keep producing at the rate we are producing on. But we had in the quarter strong OEM business. The commercial business was very solid. Our Aerospace business was up high single digits in the first quarter, and we are forecasting it to be up mid-single digit for the year. So strong growth in all segments and maybe there’s a bit of conservatism there, but we feel really good about our Aerospace business in all of our market segments.
Operator: And our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is open.
Brett Linzey: Just wanted to come back to margins. Obviously, a lot of noise with FX and deal impacts moving through the reported margins, what were the core incremental margins that you saw in the quarter at the total company level and at the segment level?
Dave Zapico: Okay. At the AMETEK level it was 35% and at the EIG level it was 50% and at the EMG level it was 25%. So pretty typical performance, very strong performance and that we are very pleased.
Brett Linzey: Okay, good. And then just a follow-up on the order question. Appreciate the color on the 3.5%. What does that look like at the segment level, were both positive or was the complexion, one negative, one up. And then within that order number, should we assume that that includes roughly two points of price, similar to what you realized that the sales line in the quarter? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Yes. You probably should assume that because our pricing is been pretty consistent.At the group line, EIG was up 5% organically in orders and EMG was up 1% organically in orders. And EMG had the toughest hurdle, because last year we had a very difficult comp at 12% and EMG was a bit stronger than EIG. So really all of our businesses have solid order performance and we have, as I said before, an excellent book-to-bill and record backlog. So we are feeling really good about the orders and it’s really across the board.
Brett Linzey: And then maybe just one last one on pricing, very good pricing power all year really as you guys look out into the balance of the year and you have seen some of these commodities and raw material start to moderate here. Is there a period of give back and maybe you could just update us remind us how you are pricing mechanisms work, specifically within the metals business?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I’d say in AMETEK, except for the metals business. There isn’t a period of give back. I think within the metals business. We don’t really count that is price. So that’s just the commodity fluctuations that get passed on to the customer. And what you really have there is a lot of the metals have stabilized, but the price of vanadium is one metal that’s important to us that’s trough as strong recently. So that will have a modest impact as we go forward on EMG’s specialty metals business, but I don’t expect much of an impact at the AMETEK level.
Operator: And our following question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Your line is open.
Robert McCarthy: It’s nice to have a boring AMETEK, right. And yeah, but I guess from that perspective in some of the excellent questioning that was ahead of May. I think it is a question about kind of the guide the cadence for the year. Could you talk about that in the context of you have entered a kind of slightly different range for the kind of deals you are looking at terms of growth and potentially valuation and even, and even underlying margins. Do you think given what the properties you are looking at now just dictated by the market environment, the pricing environment. Do you think that some of the accretion is being blunted, so that we might see a little bit more next year or another way to saying it is of the deals you have announced so far. What would you expect for kind of accretion in 2020, given the fact that it sounds like do have a lot of puts and takes for 2019?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think in 2018, we said that was about $0.12 of benefit. In 2019, there is about 12% of -- $0.12 of benefit from an M&A and we had a lot of deals, sluggish deals at the end of 2018. So those deals are working their way through the system and there are certainly a lot of integration activities going on. So yes, from those deals the timing wise will be though I have a potentially bigger, bigger benefit in 2020. But we are still seeing good margins now with our core business, and that’s very positive on those deals and the integrations are progressing very well. So they are spread out amongst our operating units and we feel good about them.
Robert McCarthy: And, and forgive me for another kind of impolitic question, but it’s easier ask these questions, when your stock has rallied as significantly as it has in the investor perception has changed radically as it has over the last three years. But if you were so critical about yourself and the organization over the past three years to four years in terms of M&A, how do you miss on a transaction? Or how do you grade yourself on where you are pitfalls are with AMETEK strategic style in terms of going after assets?
Dave Zapico: I think our style was one that equates to returns. And we look for a cash-on-cash, after-tax, return on invested capital, 10% in year three on all these deals and we haven’t changed that. And we are getting that kind of return on the deals were getting done and we are not chasing deals that we can get a return on. So our per take maybe that we are not paying the inflated prices, but we feel very comfortable in the long run that there’s a lot of discipline in our system, we want to maintain that discipline, and we look at the return on total capital on our balance sheet. The return on capital is about 13% in the first quarter. Our cost of capital is more like 8.5% and we think the difference between the two as what we are creating a value for our long-term shareholders and we look at that very closely. So that’s the key driver behind our acquisition strategy. We have a lot of discipline and we don’t plan to change that.
Operator: And our following question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Deane Dray: Just like to go into some of the variables and puts and takes in the quarter, if I could. Some of the dynamics that the industrial companies have been contending with any puts and takes that you have seen regarding tariff? The second one is pull-in. Some of the companies saw cases where they actually had bigger demand pulled out of the first quarter to the fourth quarter. Did you see any of that? And then anything about - you are not typically someone to complain about the weather, but was there any factor there too? Just start there too, please.
Dave Zapico: I guess I will start with the weather and it didn’t have a measurable impact on our business. So what the tariff, Q1 2019, there was situation played out as we predicted. We had about $0.01 from the direct impact from tariffs and we offset that totally with price and our sourcing activities have been successful in reducing growth tariffs and we are active and continuing to those sourcing plan. So price actions completely offset tariffs and we feel good about that. And your last question there regarding the pull-ins, we look very hard at the pull-ins and, there is always some things pulled into Q4 before the end of the year maybe to avoid a price increase. But it wasn’t any different than any other prior year. So we are not saying we put a lot into Q4 2018. We really looked at it hard. And looked, about the same thought. So those are answered.
Deane Dray: That’s all. Good. Yes, those are all good to hear. And just going back to the record backlog and just could you remind us how much of your backlog would convert in 2019? What percent of that and just talk about that visibility that gives you?
Dave Zapico: Yes, Deane. I think it’s about 85%. It comes out in the next year. So it gives you some very good visibility. But quite frankly there were a number of our businesses that are our book and ship that in the month of the quarter. So we don’t want to take it too far. But 85% of that $1.7 billion is going to go up this year.
Deane Dray: And then last question from me. Was there any growth investments in the quarter that you would call out? What just remind us what the growth investment budget is for 2019?
Dave Zapico: Right. I highlighted the product development and EDAX and also the product development in the adjacent expansion roll-on. Those were the highlights. And regarding investment for the year, we are investing about $80 million of incremental investments in sales, marketing and engineering activities. As $80 million more than we invested in 2018. So, and that spend is relatively linear through the year and we are getting a good return on it. So certainly, we are investing heavily but our businesses are really focused on getting a return and we are very pleased with our new product development activities and also the work we are done in commercial excellence, and improving our capability to go to market.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning.
Richard Eastman: Dave, just looking at the core growth rates in the quarter, the 3% for EIG and the 7% for EMG against really a tough comp. I am curious as the revenue shook out in the quarter, was there any movement between segments, was EMG maybe a bit of a positive surprise and maybe think -- anything in EIG that maybe became an order that didn’t ship or is there -- was there any movement between the segments here relative to the first quarter macro?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. The -- one first point there, I will make a small correction that what you said. EIG organic growth was 4% in Q1, not 3%.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Fair enough. Same question then applies.
Dave Zapico: Same question applies and it really played out as we thought. I mean, we had a forecast that was -- and both sides of the business met their forecast. So it’s pretty much a…
Richard Eastman: Okay.
Dave Zapico: …very, very -- from the sales execution side, it was a very predictable quarter for us.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And the one thing that steps out from a margin perspective, your core margin in EIG of, I think, you said it was up 110 basis points on the core side.
Dave Zapico: Right.
Richard Eastman: Was that primarily, I mean, what are the dynamics there, was it -- is it mix, was there more price there in EIG product lines or mix or just seems like a very positive variance.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. You are right, Rick. It is a positive variance and you have the cost reduction factored in also. But our pricing that we got 2% in the quarter was broad based across our portfolio, but it’s a little bit higher in EIG than EMG and we definitely had a positive mix. I mean, at this stage of the cycle, people are buying our fully option products. They have money to spend and our mix is positive. So those are the two -- really three factors. We managed cost well, we have got good price in EIG and the mix was positive.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just last question around the M&A and the deals that they are kind of in your pipeline or potential deals in the pipeline, a couple of things. One, are they skewed the prospects, are they skewed towards either EIG or EMG and is there a theme in your pipeline around the type of businesses or the products? Maybe you could just address that perhaps?
Dave Zapico: Yes. EIG is about two-thirds of our business and EMG is about a third. So I think the pipeline reflects that skewing. We are looking on a lot of our business is broad based. Looking at the differentiated products, the secular versus cyclical markets would be a…
Richard Eastman: Yeah.
Dave Zapico: … priority, so it’s a lot of what you have seen recently. There is healthcare, there is more process, instrumentation, there’s an automation business, there is some very good properties we are looking at, the Power and Industrial segment. So the Aerospace business, I mean, across the Board, we are looking and...
Richard Eastman: Okay. Yeah. Is there a healthy element of this kind of connectivity theme or any type of software extensions to the hardware? Is that representative in there as well?
Dave Zapico: A little bit.
Richard Eastman: Yeah.
Dave Zapico: You see a little bit, it’s around in a little bit with telearm and things like that, that’s certainly…
Richard Eastman: Yeah.
Dave Zapico: …a theme we are looking at. But it’s not -- doesn’t define our entire pipeline for sure.
Richard Eastman: Yeah. Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Richard.
Operator: Thank you. And our following question comes from Joe Giordano. Your line is open.
Joe Giordano: Good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Hey. So, if you have a guess, if you spend the same amount in 2019 on M&A, you did in 2018. Is it more likely that in six deals, more than six deal, less than six deals, like how you skewing the size that’s in your pipeline right now?
Dave Zapico: I don’t want to guess, Joe. Because the pipeline has some more sizable deals and it also has some smaller deals and with our disciplined approach, you don’t know what you are going to find. So we could spend the same as we spent last year. We could spend a lot more. We can spend less and the deals could be a lot of different sizes. So I don’t want -- that’s pretty hard to predict at this point of the year.
Joe Giordano: Fair enough. Dave, one of the things you have focused on when you came on to CEO role was kind of spending to reinvigorate organic growth and on the front end of the business. And certainly that’s shown through on results but part of that is also in your underlying market is getting better. So how would kind of break that down between success internally at AMETEK relative to just your markets getting better over the last couple of years here?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. That’s -- we just finished our ninth quarter in a row with our average organic growth of 6%. So we are really pleased with that. But, clearly, the economic environment helped us, but certainly the focus and work that we are doing is improved also. Our customer facing capability is really improved and our teams are excited and we are seeing positive results from growth Kaizens and digital marketing, and our sales force is much more effective. We are driving aftermarket growth and it’s becoming part of our culture and important part of our business system. So it’s very difficult to bifurcate between the market growth and the company specific growth. But I can just tell you that we are making great progress and we will let the numbers speak for themselves.
Joe Giordano: And then maybe last, if you could do your kind of wrap up of everything on year?
Dave Zapico: Sure. Yeah.
Joe Giordano: Yeah.
Dave Zapico: Yeah. If I go around the horn with market segment commentary, our process -- I will start with process. Our process businesses had outstanding start to the year. Overall sales were up mid-teens. The growth was mid single-digit organically and contributions from the acquisitions of SoundCom, Forza, Telcellular and Spectro Scientific. Our Materials Analysis business did saw particularly strong and broad-based growth and they are continuing to see solid demand for their high end analytical instrumentation. So that team has done an excellent job. For all of 2019, we continue to expect organic sales to be up mid-single digits. Our Aerospace and Defense business delivered excellent results as I talked about before, high single-digit organic growth for the quarter. Our growth remains solid across our various Aerospace markets with notable strength across our Military and Commercial OEM businesses. For all of 2019, we continue to expect mid single-digit organic sales growth with balanced growth across each market. For our Power and Industrial sub-segment, we saw mid single-digit growth in the first -- we saw mid single-digit growth in the first quarter and that was driven by the recent acquisition of Motec. Organic sales were flat in the quarter for Power and Industrial in line with our expectations. We had a difficult prior year comparison in our Power Test and Measurement business. And for all of 2019, we continue to expect low-to-mid single-digit organic growth, driven by the strength of our backlog and the solid order patterns that we are seeing across these businesses. And finally for our Automation and Engineered Solutions, we saw growth across those businesses. They remain solid with mid single-digit organic sales growth in the quarter. We continue to see excellent growth from our Dunkermotoren business tied to the automation macro trend in serving. In addition, we saw notable strength across our Engineered Medical Components businesses in the quarter. That team is really doing a fantastic job, the EMC business. And for all of 2019, we continue to expect solid mid single-digit organic sales growth for our Automation and Engineer Solutions business. So, thank you, that’s a walk around the horn, Joe.
Joe Giordano: Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our following question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Ken Newman: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Ken Newman on for Steve.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Ken.
Bill Burke: Good morning.
Ken Newman: Good morning. Hey. I just wanted to clarify, so the hurdle rates within your M&A pipeline haven’t changed in terms of deal size and return metrics and multiples versus what you have said on prior calls. Is that correct?
Dave Zapico: No change.
Ken Newman: No change. So, on the larger end then that $300 million to $500 million in revenue type size or deal size is probably at the upper echelon?
Dave Zapico: Correct.
Ken Newman: Okay. And then it does seem, as my follow-on, it seems that you are pretty positive on the end markets outside of maybe some uncertainty from trade policy, but given maybe some of the conservatism in your guidance. I am curious to hear what your view is on the cycle, where do you think -- what inning do you think we are in right now and how much more legs does this cycle have you think?
Dave Zapico: They are very difficult to predict. As we communicated early in the year, we expect solid growth this year, but it’s -- the growth is going to moderate a bit. And it’s driven by the trade tensions, the global macro uncertainty, and additionally, we have some very difficult comps. And we are staying close to Asia, because of the trade difficulties, but overall, it feels pretty good and where our guys typically a bit conservative. And we are waiting to see things play out, but we feel good about the year.
Ken Newman: Got it. Last one from me and I am sorry if I missed it, how much of the $80 million in OpEx savings have been realized in the first quarter?
Dave Zapico: $18 million of the $80 million, right on our plan…
Ken Newman: Okay.
Dave Zapico: … and that accelerate a bit as we progressed through the year.
Ken Newman: Thanks a lot.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Ken.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Your line is open.
Robert McCarthy: You can’t get rid of me it’s more like a bad penny. So just a couple of more since we are round it out for the hour. Touching on your Asia comments, I mean, obviously, you are not exactly a bellwether like three in terms of broad octopus touching every different end market, but you did highlight kind of some incremental softness coming in the February some uncertainty, even the March rebounding. And I think you made a comment about Asia as a whole, right, versus China specifically. So maybe you could just amplify your comments there in terms of what you are seeing -- in terms of what’s going on?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. So the -- as I said, Asia was roughly flat. China sales were down mid-single digits, against a difficult comp. We have done very well over there for the better part of two years. And while the China orders were up, low-single digits for Q1, so similar to Asia, we had tremendous order input in China in March. I mentioned the dynamic of slow February tied to the Chinese New Year. The other thing our MAT business our Materials Analysis business had a great quarter in China and some of our project businesses with difficult comps were off a little bit. So when you look at China as a whole, we had the good orders in line with low-single digits for Q1 and for the full year for China, we expect the growth to be in line with the 3% to 5% of all of AMETEK. So it’s moderating from the double-digit growth for past couple of years, but still solid and we are still staying close of that, but there was a bit of uncertainty. It’s the one uncertainty that we are watching closely because of the global trade situation.
Robert McCarthy: Two more if you will forgive me. One you were mail wanted to ask about Brexit, any kind of impact there that we should be thinking about?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. The U.K. accounts for about 4% of AMETEK sales. We are preparing for our Brexit. So we are not assuming there is a political solution. Now the can’s been kicked down the road, it’s delayed until the fall. Certainly there maybe some administrative issues that may cause delays in getting product in and out of Europe into the Mainland, but our businesses are very in tune with the issue. We probably are carrying about a million pounds of inventory to different preposition to make sure them that we are going to be able to sustain a short-term problem, but we -- our businesses from the U.K. to a lot of exporting already not to the Mainland. So we not from the U.K., there may be some administrative issues in the short-term and we are hoping for a solution, but again preparing for hard Brexit.
Robert McCarthy: And then finally just on the M&A environment, obviously, what you guys ultimately do, you go out and buy these private companies, closely held companies, some public companies, but ultimately make them a heck of a lot better and create a lot of value, which is wonderful. And as you know got work as a compounder. But I guess the question I have is for given the prevailing environment, where valuations are, where funding is an optionality. How do you think about the potential for select divestitures in the portfolio and how do you think about the repurchase option which you obviously hit the ignition on over the last six months?
Dave Zapico: Yeah. Our number one priority for capital allocation is to support our capital and acquisitions, and buy good businesses and make them better, that’s generated long-term return for our shareholders and it’s a clear priority. At the end of last year, we have an opportunistic approach to buybacks. Our stock and a significant market dislocation and we deployed a significant amount of capital and bought back some shares in the low ‘70s that will take a good move at this time. And then the priority three for the capital allocation will be a modest consistent dividend. In terms of your other question about our portfolio, we are in process of completing our annual strategic review. This is where we closely look at all elements of our portfolio. In the review last year, we concluded that we are very comfortable with our portfolio and we are clear profitable growth opportunities for each of our businesses. So our strategy is to focus on a broad diverse set of niche markets and we don’t want to become exposed to any one single market customer, technology and but we haven’t completed our review that you share. We do it every year and we go through that review and may come to a different decision we will let you know, but we are comfortable with our performance.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks again for your time.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Bill Burke: Thanks, Rob.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Scott Graham: Hey. Good morning, Dave, Kevin and Bill. How’s it going?
Dave Zapico: Whatever -- wherever that in.
Scott Graham: Yeah. I mean I was napping there. I don’t know what happened on the queue here, but I saw -- I just took a nap, but Rob was right, the quarter was boringly comfortable.
Dave Zapico: I am wondering how Rob got two questions and before you got one.
Scott Graham: I think, Rob, got about nine in, but that’s…
Dave Zapico: That’s said.
Scott Graham: That’s good. He -- this is good questions as usual. I do have three more, believe or not. So I just want to understand the cadence of organic that you are thinking this year. Obviously you kind of came in at the high end this quarter on the organic. But also obviously if you look at the stack comp, your second half comps kind of jump up 200 basis points versus the first half. So would -- are you guys kind of thinking that 3 to 5 kind of comes a little heavier in the first half and in the second half?
Dave Zapico: Not really. I mean, I wouldn’t read too much into it. I mean, we grew sales at organically at the high end of our guidance range and it’s still early in the year and we want to be prudent. So that will be the biggest driver. As we mentioned before, we do have some tough comps and that’s driving some moderating growth, but we are feeling good with how the year is playing out nicely one more behind us.
Scott Graham: And I guess this is next. One is a question for both you and Bill. As I know from his history, you typically can really get some good working capital out of your acquisitions after that first, six to 12 months kind of thing. Could we expect an acceleration in free cash flow as the year progresses?
Bill Burke: I would say that the free cash flow probably be a little more heavily weighted into the back half of the year than it is in the front half. And I think it’s, as you, as you mentioned, we were able to drive the benefits from businesses that are now inside the AMETEK portfolio for a longer period of time as well as getting after improving working capital performance across all of our base businesses.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you, Will. So my last question is kind going back to an earlier question on M&A, but more specifically, on the segments. There has been a profound difference in M&A, in EIG versus EMG. And I am just trying to wonder why that is I mean I am looking at the organics from electromechanical over the last couple of years they have been outstanding. And I am also thinking that I know you are into the connectivity saying and Dunkermotoren is on that side of the house. So kind of like what’s going on there that is not where we are not seeing more M&A on that side of the house?
Bill Burke: Yes. We are seeing some M&A have set out. We did major aerospace last year and we are actively looking in all of our businesses, put together a strategic plan and we look at those opportunities. And when you look at the characteristics of differentiation, we have very differentiated businesses with Dunkermotorenwith our aerospace presence. So our aerospace business had an outstanding quarter. So we are looking at that both sides of our house. And I think over the past 10 years, there’s one point EIG and EMG were about the same size and EIG is just grown a little bit bigger. So there is clearly a strong desire to do acquisitions on either side of the business.
Scott Graham: Would you maybe as a corollary to that, would you say that this is my speculation of course, aerospace particularly aftermarket oriented as well as connectivity assets, which are on the electromechanical side of the house that the prices for those deals are a little higher than what you would want for your ROIC or is that just a bad guess…
Bill Burke: I wouldn’t say that - I wouldn’t say that. The pricing is really dependent on the niche market that we are looking and the expectations of the sellers. So I wouldn’t say that I mean, there is a big difference between EIG and EMG from the product portfolio. EIG has a lot of direct and aftermarket with the end users and EMG in large part is a OEM supplier, except for the aerospace business. So, but really we are looking on both sides and I wouldn’t draw anything from your prior point.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin Coleman: Great, thank you, Sydney. Thank you everyone for joining today. And as a reminder, a replay of today’s webcast can be accessed on our website later today. Have a great day.

Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. AMETEK had an excellent fourth quarter to complete another outstanding year. For the full-year, we established records for essentially all key financial metrics. We delivered 7% organic sales growth and 26% growth in diluted earnings per share. We generated record cash flows which we successfully deployed on strategic acquisitions and we continued to invest on our businesses to position them for long-term success. In addition to the impressive result for the full-year, we also had a fantastic fourth quarter with record results. Sales were up low-double-digits driven by strong acquisition contributions and continued solid organic growth. Orders also grew at a strong pace and we ended the year with a record backlog. Operating profit growth and operating margin expansion in the quarter were excellent leading to a high quality of earnings that exceeded expectations. We remained very active investing on our strong cash flows, deploying over $750 million on three acquisitions, and $364 million on an opportunistic share repurchases in the quarter. We also bolstered the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet with an expanded revolving credit line and completed a private placement debt offering providing us significant capacity to pursue future growth opportunities. Now for the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.3 billion, up 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Organic sales growth was solid at 5% with acquisitions contributing 7% in foreign currency, a 1% headwind. Orders also remain very solid, overall orders were up 11% over the prior year with organic orders up 5%. Another positive book-to-bill quarter resulted in a record backlog of more than $1.6 billion providing us with solid visibility as we enter 2019. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $332 million, up 22% over the prior year period with EBITDA margins a very strong 26.1%. Operating income in the quarter was a record $282 million, up 14% over the same quarter last year, with reported operating margin of 22.2% up 50 basis points over the prior year period. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, operating margins increased an impressive 130 basis points over last year's fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share were a record $0.86 in the quarter representing an outstanding 23% increase over the prior year's fourth quarter earnings. Now for the full-year 2018 results. AMETEK delivered annual record essentially on all key financial metrics in 2018. Overall sales were up 13% to $4.8 billion. Organic sales grew an impressive 7%, acquisitions contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a one point benefit. Overall orders were up 11% and organic orders were also up 7% in 2018. Full-year operating income was $1.1 billion and operating margins were up 70 basis points to 22.2%. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, 2018 operating margins were up an impressive 110 basis points over 2017. Full-year diluted earnings per share were $3.29, up 26% over the prior year. Now turning to the fourth quarter results of the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Fourth quarter sales for EIG were up 11% to a record $826 million. Recent acquisitions contributed 8%, organic sales grew 4%, and foreign currency was a one point headwind. We continue to see strong growth across our process businesses, with particular strength on our Materials Analysis businesses. EIG's operating income in the quarter was a record $214.6 million, up 11% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Reported operating margins were 26%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG margins were up a robust 130 basis points versus the prior year. The Electromechanical Group had another excellent quarter with strong sales growth and outstanding operating performance. EMG sales in the fourth quarter were $445.3 million, up 11% over the fourth quarter of 2017. Organic sales growth was very strong at 9%, while the acquisition of FMH Aerospace contributed 3%, and foreign currency was a one point headwind. Sales grew nicely across all EMG businesses in the quarter with particular strength across our aerospace and engineered materials businesses. EMG's operating performance in the quarter was outstanding with operating income increasing 18% to $85.8 million and operating margins expanding 110 basis points to 19.3%. So to summarize, AMETEK delivered tremendous performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Each of our businesses continue to deliver exceptional results through the execution of AMETEK growth model which combines our four growth strategies with a disciplined focus on cash generation and capital deployment to create long-term value for all of AMETEK's stakeholders. I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for their exceptional work and success in 2018. Before I discuss our outlook for 2019, I wanted to highlight some of the efforts our businesses are taking to drive the future of AMETEK. I will start with acquisitions. 2018 was an exciting year on the acquisition front having deployed a record level of capital to acquire six outstanding businesses. We deployed over $1.1 billion on capital on these acquisitions and acquired approximately $350 million in annual sales. In the fourth quarter alone, we completed three acquisitions. Forza and Telular which I highlighted during our last earnings call and Spectro Scientific which we acquired in late November. Spectro Scientific is a leading provider of machine condition monitoring solutions for critical assets and high-value industrial applications. They offer differentiated solutions that serve the increasing need for productive maintenance in a broad and growing set of end-markets. Spectro Scientific provides both lab-based and onsite instrumentation including consumables, and cloud-based software analytics to help customers determine the model of the condition of lubricants and fluids in mission critical equipment. They're based in Chelmsford, Mass, and have approximately $50 million in annual sales. Spectro Scientific along with the other businesses acquired in 2018 are integrating very nicely into AMETEK and we expect them to add tremendous value going forward. In addition to deploying a record level of capital and acquisitions, we also deployed $364 million on share repurchases during the quarter, bringing the total capital deployed in 2018 to nearly $1.5 billion. Acquisitions clearly remain the number one priority for capital deployment. As we have done in the past, we will continue to repurchase our shares opportunistically and will continue to pay a modest dividend to our shareholders. Despite the record level of capital deployment, we have significant capacity available to continue our acquisition strategy and Bill will touch on this further in a moment. We remain focused on investing back in our businesses to support the growth initiatives. In 2018, we invested approximately $75 million in incremental growth opportunities. These investments were focused across our sales and marketing and research development and engineering content. We're seeing excellent results from these initiatives as we continue to drive strong organic sales growth. One important driver of this organic sales growth is new product development. In the fourth quarter our vitality index which measures the level of sales generated for new products and solutions introduced within the last three years was excellent at 25%. The traction that our new products are gaining in the respective market speak to the success of our research, development, and engineering efforts. We also remain focused on expanding our footprint across the globe and to new adjacent markets. In October, we celebrated the opening of our newest technology solutions center in Bangalore, India. The center showcases the latest products and technologies of many of AMETEK's businesses and is designed to assist customers in selecting the right equipment and enhance our service platforms within the region. This facility greatly enhances our ability to expand our position in India's attractive growth market. We will continue to expand our global sales channels, develop additional service capabilities, and add to our manufacturing flexibility to better serve our customers and support global growth. Lastly, our operational excellence initiatives continue to drive strong improvements in the operating performance as was seen in our margin expansion in the fourth quarter and full-year results. In 2018, we generated approximately $90 million in savings from our operational excellence initiatives, largely driven by our global sourcing and strategic procurement efforts. We also remain focused on driving top-line growth through our expanded commercial excellence toolkit which continues to drive additional market share gains across our businesses. These key strategies make-up the cornerstone of AMETEK's growth model and will remain a strong focus as we move into 2019. Now let me provide some brief comments on tariffs. Our businesses continue to do a tremendous job managing each of the work streams we have put in place to help address the effects of tariffs. Our situation remains fluid. We remain very confident in our ability to mitigate the headwinds from the announced tariffs given our ability to capture incremental pricing due to the highly differentiated nature of our business, the strength and flexibility of our global supply chain, and our ability to ship production given our asset-light business model. AMETEK's proven Operational Excellence capability, which captures each of these elements positions us extremely well to offset the impacts from tariffs. In the fourth quarter, we will be able to fully offset the direct impact from tariffs and for all of 2019; we also expect we will be able to offset the impact of known tariffs through our various initiatives. Now I will move to our outlook for the year. As we noted in our press release, going forward, we will report EPS results and guidance on an adjusted basis that adds back non-cash after-tax acquisition related intangible amortization. We believe providing this non-GAAP measure allows our shareholders to better understand the strength of our cash flow generation and core operating results and aligns more comparably to our acquisitive peers. With that said, we expect 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05, an increase of 8% to 11% over the comparable results in 2018. We expect overall sales in 2019 to be up high-single-digits. Organic sales are expected to be up 3% to 5% with a similar level of organic growth across each reportable segment. For the first quarter, we anticipate sales will be up high-single-digits, adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.95 to $0.97 per diluted share, and 9% to 11% increase over the prior year. To conclude, our teams performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and delivered outstanding results in 2018. We are firmly positioned to achieve another year of solid growth and sustainable long-term success to the execution of the AMETEK growth model. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK finished the year with a strong performance and a high quality of earnings in the fourth quarter. I will provide some additional financial details but first a brief comment on the fourth quarter tax related gain. As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, AMETEK recognized a net gain in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities and the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. This gain was considered provisional and was subject to further adjustments during the measurement period. The $11.8 million or $0.05 we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 was the finalization of the provisional adjustments from Tax Reform. Now on to the additional financial highlights. Core selling expense was up in line with core sales in the quarter. General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were down slightly over the prior year and were 1.5% of sales in the quarter, down from 1.6% of sales in last year's fourth quarter. 2019 general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2018 levels. The adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 22.8% and in line with our expectations. This compares to last year's adjusted rate of 25.7%. The year-over-year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of Tax Reform. In 2019, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. As we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year estimated rate. Working capital in the quarter was very solid at 16.9% of sales essentially in line with last year's fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $35 million for the quarter and $82 million for the full-year. We expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be approximately $100 million or 1.9% of sales reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense was $54 million in the fourth quarter and $200 million for the full-year. In 2019, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $235 million including acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $130 million or $0.43 per diluted share. As Dave mentioned, our businesses continue to generate excellent levels of cash flow. Fourth quarter operating cash flow and free cash flow were both records at $296 million and $262 million respectively with both up 17% over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion for the quarter was outstanding at 131% of adjusted net income. Our full-year cash flow was also very strong, operating cash flow for 2018 was $926 million, and free cash flow was $843 million, both of these metrics up 11% over the prior year. We remain focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions, and as Dave mentioned, AMETEK had an outstanding year on this front. In all of 2018, we deployed more than $1.1 billion on six acquisitions with approximately $750 million deployed on three acquisitions in the fourth quarter alone. In addition, we deployed $368 million on share repurchases in 2018, with $364 million of the repurchases occurring in the fourth quarter. Total debt at December 31st was $2.63 billion, up from $2.17 billion at the end of 2017. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $354 million. Following our record level of capital deployment in 2018, we still have significant capacity to support our growth initiatives with more than $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities. These amounts reflect the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended and upsized revolving credit facility we announced in November and which I discussed during our last call as well as the private placement offering we announced in mid-December. The private placement offering consisted of $660 million of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 3.93% and a weighted average maturity of 8.2 years. The proceeds were used to pay outstanding borrowings on our revolver as well as a maturing $100 million senior note in December. To summarize, our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter to complete an exceptional year. Looking ahead to 2019, our outlook is positive as we are well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Thanks, Bill. Jimmy could we please open the lines for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Scott Graham: So I have two questions, one on organic and one on the savings which is easy, the 3% to 5% organic guidance, I'm just wondering two things on this, your orders, organic orders have been running at 5% or better for quite some time. You had a pretty good fourth quarter, I'm just wondering is there something relative to the orders where maybe that's maybe a little bit longer-term that would be keeping the guidance to 3% to 5%? And then secondly what gets you to the 5%?
Dave Zapico: Right, I appreciate the question. We’re expecting solid growth in 2019. But we do expect the growth to moderate compared to 2018 and the growth is moderating a bit because of the global uncertainties and the trade tensions but we expect to continue to grow nicely. And certainly the comparisons will make it more difficult. We just completed eight quarters with average organic growth of 6% and six straight quarters with a positive book-to-bill. So and we ended the year with a record backlog. So overall we feel very good about the environment where we're operating in, and we feel good what we're hearing from our businesses and our customers and we continue to see solid underlying demand and we're positioned to perform very well in this environment and we're executing very well. But there is a little bit of global uncertainty and our guidance takes that into account.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you. And then secondly on the savings, I know you mentioned that most of the $90 million in savings this year was from global procurement. I was wondering if you can kind of maybe specifically parse that out global procurement versus the other areas and what you're expecting that -- on that from each for 2019 as well?
Dave Zapico: Sure, sure, Scott. And as you know we started the year in 2018 with an $80 million guide for cost savings and those are cost savings that actually work their way through the P&L. And where we ended up, we did a little bit better than that and it was largely driven by our sourcing initiatives. So we ended up at $90 million as you mentioned about $70 million of that was from sourcing and about $20 million was from other OpEx initiatives. And for 2019, we're starting the guide at $80 million, about $60 million of that will come from sourcing initiatives and strategic procurement initiatives, and about $20 million from other OpEx initiatives. Does that answer your question?
Scott Graham: Thanks a lot. Yes.
Dave Zapico: Okay. Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe: Yes, I want to get away from the ops for a second and just talk about the share repos in 4Q, I mean you're not known for being a heavy repurchase company. So is that a reflection of the M&A options on the table here that the backlog or is it more a reflection of your share price that's in the November/December and supporting your stock at those levels but the real question is how does the M&A backlog look from here?
Dave Zapico: Yes, the M&A backlog looks great. We just completed a record year and I think the pipeline looks equivalent to what it looked like as we entered 2018. So for 2019 we have a very strong pipeline. Over time, we have an opportunistic view of share purchases and we see the market adjust like it did in the fourth quarter and we have a strong balance sheet. We thought it was a good time to buy back some shares. And in the past that has been a good investment for AMETEK shareholders when we made that decision.
Nigel Coe: I agree with that. And then --
Dave Zapico: When you think about our balance sheet, Nigel, we entered 2018 with a debt-to-EBITDA of about 1.95% -- of 1.95%. We end 2018 at the same level, 1.96%. So we deployed over $1.5 billion on acquisitions and M&A and we still have the same debt-to-EBITDA. So it's really the strong balance sheet, the strong cash flow generation and generating capability of the company and the fact that we can control our own destiny to a certain degree.
Nigel Coe: Great. And then one question two parts, what have you seen in China, you got a recently large exposure to China about terms of the sales, what you see in there by major business? And then on tariffs, you talked about how you're accompanying couple of tariffs, do you have list 3 25% priced right now or do you have to go out and re-price if we do get that step up in March?
Dave Zapico: Right, great question. The list 3 is built into our guidance, so we assumed in March 1st that the tariff would go to 25%, that's built into our guide and as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel comfortable that we will be able to offset the impact of tariffs completely. And regarding to China, China is an important market for us, it's about 9% of our sales and China grew nicely in the quarter, it drove overall Asia growth of 12% and there was a bit higher than the overall Asia growth and certainly the trade situation with China has a complexity that we're watching very closely. So far we continue to grow nicely but we're going to continue to monitor that. As I've said before the reality is that we produce products that China market needs to upgrade their manufacturing capability to monitor to nuclear power plants and help clean up their environment. We are expecting growth to moderate in 2019 more in line with AMETEK's overall growth but we feel good about that level of growth in China for 2019.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Matt Summerville: Can you first talk about how much price you guys actually realized in 2018 and based upon the comments you just made, David, how much price do you anticipate realizing for 2019?
Dave Zapico: Sure, Matt. As you will recall, during the year we increased our pricing as we got ahead of tariffs and inflation and Q4 was misolate [ph] Q3. Q4 we had an excellent quarter, we achieved a bit more than 2% of price across our entire portfolio. Total inflation was about 1.5%. So we're very pleased with these results and we think we're well-positioned to continue the trend in 2019. Specifically for 2019, we're expecting about two points of price and about the same level on total inflation about 1.5 points. So the results speak to the highly differentiated nature of our AMETEK portfolio and our leadership position in niche markets and our focus and determination to make sure we stay in front of the global changing environment. So we're feeling good about pricing going into 2019.
Matt Summerville: And then, David, can you comment when you look into fourth quarter specifically with EMG, what drove the year-over-year acceleration in organic performance against a double-digit comparison? And then, specifically can you also comment at what you're seeing with respect to the robotics and automation market specifically? Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes, robotics and automation was a driver of the EMG growth but it was more broad-based on that. I mean we had really solid growth in the military aerospace business and we also saw solid growth on our EMED business. So pretty much all components of the EMG were firing in all cylinders in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Allison Poliniak: Could you maybe give us a little bit more color on growth investments in 2019 I know obviously new product development there? Where else are you focusing your growth investment dollars for 2019 at this point?
Dave Zapico: Right, our growth investments, incremental growth investments for 2019 are up about 7% versus 2018 and we're going to invest incrementally about $80 million in growth investments and they're going to be across incremental sales opportunities, incremental marketing opportunities, and incremental engineering opportunities. And then they're in three buckets and they are probably about equally spread across those buckets.
Allison Poliniak: That's helpful. And then incremental operating leverage for 2019, anything we should be mindful of there that could maybe drive it outside of the normal for you?
Dave Zapico: We were -- we -- for 2018, we have excellent operating income margins, we had about 110 basis points of expansion ex-acquisitions and the core incrementals were about 35%. And we think about 2019 we're back to about 34, 30 to 40 basis points of operating income margin expansion and we're back to about the incrementals of 30% to 35%, there's really nothing driving that except there's -- we're going to see how the year gets started and but we feel good about the way the company is performing and the margin performance of the company.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn: Hey Dave, wondering about the $80 million in savings forecast similar to executed in 2019, you have been delivering that range as long as I've been covering you, just want to ask about the evergreen aspects of that, does that get more challenging at some point?
Dave Zapico: I don't think it does, Chris it is kind of in our D&A. I mean we go around to each of our businesses and we look at cost reductions as an element of our core operating environment and then there's always new acquisitions that come into the fold that provide some new opportunities. So I think we're solid for 2019. And when I look long-term, I think as long as we keep executing our strategy they will remain evergreen opportunities.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks for that. And in the outlook, I'm just curious if you're seeing any acceleration in aerospace clearly some peers are seeing that into that vertical and overall if there are other areas that are accelerating whereas notably stable or potentially some rollover?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think our aerospace and defense businesses has had an outstanding fourth quarter. I mean a lot of it is what you see across other businesses. Our sales were up high teens on a percentage basis in the quarter and the growth was driven by very strong organic growth. Our organic growth was 10% on our aerospace business in the fourth quarter. We had similar for the first three quarters a year, we continue to see solid and balanced growth across aerospace markets with notable strength across both commercial and military businesses and so we're feeling good about our aerospace business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Brett Linzey: Hey, just wanted to talk about the pace or pattern of activity through Q4 any, any major fluctuations between October and December and then how did January orders perform for the total company?
Dave Zapico: Yes, great question, Brett. Q4 played out like a typical Q4. We strengthened in the Q4 and December was our strongest month in terms of orders and sales. So that's pretty typical for us and we had a very strong December as we anticipated. When you look at January recently completed our orders were right on plan. So we feel real good about January orders and then across the board, across all business, they came in on plan, so we feel good about that too.
Brett Linzey: Okay. And then just more and more housekeeping, what are you assuming for interest expense in 2019 given the heavy deal load in Q4 and are you assuming any deleveraging within that assumption? Thanks.
Dave Zapico: Yes, our interest expense is going to be up a bit for -- in 2019, up a little bit and what was the second question, Brett?
Brett Linzey: Just --
Dave Zapico: We have it. If you look at our debt profile, most of it is fixed debt with some balance on the revolver. So given the new private placement in December and the heavy acquisition and share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter, you'll see an increase probably upwards of close to 10% in interest expense year-over-year. And given that most everything of our debt is fixed, you'll see modest deleveraging as we pay down our revolver. But again that's really going to depend on the pace of acquisition activity as we go through the year or so. Our full expectation is we'll continue to be very active on the deal front and deleveraging won't be a factor.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray: Hey, I would like to start first with congratulations on the move to cash EPS but we all acknowledge it doesn't change the fundamentals but it certainly puts you on a level playing field with your acquisition line of competitors. What I also like seeing is that you guys are willing to adapt and be flexible, so maybe you can share with us a bit about the deliberation process internally, obviously you are at the beginning of the year would be the time to do it but any insight in to the focus internally on this?
Dave Zapico: Yes, it all comes down to our cash flow and we have strong cash flows or consistent cash flows and it's just another window into our financials that will allow our shareholders to better understand the strength of those cash generating capabilities. And as you said it aligns more comparably with our acquisitive peers. But it doesn't change how we're operating the business, it doesn't change how we're valuing deals, we always value deals on a cash basis anyhow. So really it's additional information, a different window into the business that will provide our investors with that view. And we've got most people that we talk to want to go cash EPS, some a minority, were not fans of it, but net-net the aggregate it was a good decision for us because we didn't want to disadvantage everyone versus our peers.
Deane Dray: Great. And for the record we're big fans of the move, so we applaud that.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Deane Dray: And then second question is on CapEx. So $100 million, you did $82 million in 2018, that's a nice healthy 20% plus boost. And if we look around the multi industry sector that's probably going to be one of the higher if not the highest percentage increases. I think it's the first look we're seeing is closer to flat, so that speaks to your growth ambitions and confidence but can you share with us the thought about investing CapEx here at this rate and how committed are you to spend all of it and kind of -- what kind of returns are you expecting?
Dave Zapico: We're an asset-light business and we spend less than 2% of sales historically on CapEx and the $100 million ends up being about 1.9% of sales and they're really good projects across our businesses and it makes sense to fund them and they're all have excellent returns. So I think there is a commitment to do that and our businesses have good plans. So we're bigger business, we acquire some businesses, there is some investments that are needed to be made still within the context of being asset-light business and spending less than 2% of sales on capital.
Deane Dray: And do you look at those returns in comparison to the same thresholds on acquisitions what's the algorithm there?
Dave Zapico: Yes, usually the returns on internal CapEx are much higher. But there is a process that is a similar metrics on returns and they come bottom up from our businesses and we evaluate them during the budget process and that's where we ended up this year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Your line is now open.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning everyone. Can you hear me?
Dave Zapico: Yes, great.
Robert McCarthy: Great to be back and I must say, Brett, had asked a while very, very direct good question. So we're getting to the end of the bingo card here. But nevertheless just a couple of things, I mean I guess number one I know I've been out of it for a while but can you do the typical around the horn on organic growth across the segments and orders trends?
Dave Zapico: Sure, Rob, and we are glad to have you back and I will go around the horn. I talk about aerospace a little bit and so I will start with our process businesses and we finished the year with an excellent fourth quarter. The overall sales order were up mid teens driven by contributions from the acquisitions of SoundCom, Forza, Telular, and Spectro Scientific. Organic sales were up mid-single-digits in the quarter with particularly strong growth across our materials analysis business. And for 2019 we expect another solid year for our process businesses with organic sales expected to be at mid-single-digits. Our automation and engineered solutions business has closed out the year with another excellent quarter with organic sales up high-single-digits in the fourth quarter. Our Dunkermotoren continues to deliver excellent results as their growth funnel is driving exciting new applications in precision motion control. Additionally, as I mentioned before our engineered solution businesses are seeing continued solid demand across our key markets. And in 2019, we expect solid mid-single-digit organic growth across our automation and engineered solutions business. And that brings me to power and industrial. Overall sales for power and industrial were up mid-single-digits driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of Arizona Instrument and Motec. Organic sales were down low-single-digits in the quarter against a difficult prior year comparison for our power instrumentation business. And for 2019, we expect low-to-mid-single-digit of growth with balanced growth across our power and industrial. So if you look at our different market segments we are expecting mid-single for process, mid-single for aerospace, low-to-mid for power and industrial and mid-single for automation and engineered solutions.
Robert McCarthy: And just in that context, in the context of this question, how do you think about your oil and gas especially metals exposure for the quarter and then expectations for next year just break sense of that for us?
Dave Zapico: Yes, sure, Rob. In the fourth quarter, our oil and gas was up mid-single-digits, our upstream was up mid-teens and our mid and downstream was flat. It was precipitous decline and then a significant increase in the quarter; it really didn't impact business conditions much for us. For all of 2019, we expect our oil and gas business to grow mid-single-digits, and we expect the upstream to be up high-single-digits, and mid and downstream to be up low-to-mid-single-digits, so moderating growth but still solid for our oil and gas businesses.
Robert McCarthy: And in specialty metals, I mean I didn't note for that.
Dave Zapico: Yes, metals business was up a bit higher than EMG. So EMG we had solid growth and specialty metals had a good quarter. And for 2019, we expect it to be in line with AMETEK growth, so we're seeing strong markets, the end markets there are aerospace, medical, specialized industrial so that business is doing well and we're expecting it to continue in 2019 at a somewhat moderating basis.
Robert McCarthy: If you both in one follow-up, a different question, looking at some of your ostensible comps in the public markets, real acquisition stories, they definitely have a narrative around how they buy companies and I think there's a narrative view of all not formally articulated but if you were to formally articulate how you go about buying companies and improving them, what would you focus on, would you focus on besides all being public and private multiples, I mean would you focus on R&D enhancement, would you focus on international expansion or global excellence procurement, what would -- how would you explain to someone how you're going to take a business and make it better on the SG&A gross margin front, working capital front and what is kind of your secret sauce for capital deployment and fundamentally making these businesses, selecting these businesses but then fundamentally making them better?
Dave Zapico: Right, Rob, in terms of selection, it really comes down to being in a near adjacency, I mean, our existing presence and we look for product differentiation, we look for service differentiation, that's the number one attribute. And in terms of how we add value to deals, we have a long track record of taking businesses that are 10% to 15% EBITDA and then doubling the margins and over the course of three to five years and really it's all of the above in terms of how we do it, we have seasoned operators that are very experienced in M&A and very experienced in improving the businesses. And we -- the playbook that we develop can be based on improving organic growth in terms of exporting global opportunities that can be based on improving gross margins by global sourcing, it can be based on reducing G&A, it can be -- there's a whole playbook and certainly pricing is one thing that we think we have some insight into these markets and know what price can be paid and what the customers are willing to pay. So we do, we have a very well defined process, it results in custom playbooks for each business, we have excellent process capability and so, process capability across deal closing and across deal modeling, diligence and integration. And I think our secret sauce is our very strong business operators that are well ran in the AMETEK business system and they provide ownership for delivery of the financial metrics for each individual deal and none of that has changed. And we have a great class of businesses that joined AMETEK in 2018 and we are looking forward to improving them in 2019 and we also have a strong pipeline to looking at bringing into the company. So we feel very good about the M&A opportunities for AMETEK.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Andrew Obin: Just couple of questions from me, I was really surprised by your China growth number, very different I think from a lot of your competitors, can you just give us some more color as to what end markets are driving this strong performance?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think the biggest market that's driving the strong performance are our process analytics instrumentation businesses and it's chiefly because their primary products allow customers to enhance their manufacturing capabilities. So as China moves up the value chain and wants to do more sophisticated manufacturing, our process businesses provide that capability through their instrumentation. So that's the primary reason that we've been doing so well in China. And as I said we think the growth is going to moderate but we still feel good about the market.
Andrew Obin: Sure. And then the follow-up question on M&A, and by the way just too concerned, when we say process that's manufacturing process not oil and gas process?
Dave Zapico: Yes.
Andrew Obin: Right. Okay. And just a question on M&A, have you guys changed how you guys source the deals because lot of companies sort of complain about the pricing availability, you guys still seem to be able to execute very well in the M&A pipeline, if you could give us some color on sourcing of your deals and evolution of your sourcing over the past couple of years? Thank you and a great quarter by the way.
Dave Zapico: Well, thank you, Andrew. Deal sourcing is a competitive advantage for AMETEK. We have in our niche presence is we dedicate resources to developing a pipeline of deals. So some of our deals come through the typical auction process but some of our deals are privately sourced by businesses that see how we operate in the niche markets that we're in. So and we have a dedicated we have about nine, nine or 10 M&A professionals, there's 10 actually, 10 M&A professionals who work closely with our businesses and they identify strategic acquisitions and we have people dedicated to the field to, so it's a business process, it's not just an event and that process allows us to build off an intangible asset of these pipeline of deals that we follow over years. So we're looking to acquire them, they see how we operate and we're preferred buyers. So it's really a long-term commitment to the markets that we operate in and good knowledge about the targets and the pipeline, as I said, look so strong now as it did entering last year and last year we had a record year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Yes, just a follow-up on some of the other questions that have been asked. I guess first on some of the actions that we saw in the fourth quarter particularly the oil price dislocation, I think for a lot of folks who had brought up kind of the 2016, 2017 timeframe and some of the volatility you saw in the businesses back then just as a bit of a sanity check, can you remind us kind of how far off trough or maybe still how far away from prior peak some of those businesses are to -- give us some sensitivity around if we were to come into a more difficult macro scenario maybe there's not as much downside as there was back in that time frame?
Dave Zapico: Yes, sure, Josh. If we go back our oil and gas exposure was peak at about $400 million. And right now total exposure is about $290 million. So it's about 6% of the company and about $290 million, so we are still well off our peak and of our presence about one-third of that is U.S. and two-third of it is international and about 25% of it is upstream and 75% is mid and downstream. And what we're seeing in the markets pretty typical of oil and gas expansion, the upstream starts as you come out of a cycle and then it transitions to mid and downstream and we have a bigger mid and downstream presence. So we're expecting the mid and downstream to pick up a little bit this year. So we're feeling pretty good about our oil and gas presence right now and we think we're well positioned.
Josh Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. And then a lot of questions on M&A during the call maybe one more from me, a lot of your peers that are kind of in the same category is as being near compounders and who have also moved to cash EPS, I think I've also tried to develop a bit more of a recurring revenue profile, I think any idea you probably touch more data than a lot of your peers or competitors out there, is there an ambition to maybe step up the recurring revenue side of that through something in the software space, is that something that you've looked at in the pipeline, something you've kind of considered strategically, just curious what are your thoughts on those?
Dave Zapico: It’s a great question, if you look at the last two acquisitions we did with Telular and Spectro Scientific, there is both a recurring theme in both of those businesses that's tied to the software, this is tied to the data and it's -- I think with Telular we have about 65% recurring revenue and with Spectro about 25% recurring revenue. And in both cases they're dealing with information, they're dealing with algorithms; they are dealing with making the information and solving customer problems. So it's definitely a focus for us and we have a tremendous growing software capability, we've been investing in over many years we're about 150 engineers in India developing software for us in Bangalore. So we have a good internal capability and with our acquisition profile it's certainly something that we're looking at and the recurring nature is something that is key for us to grow in AMETEK.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Ken Newman: Hey, thanks for fitting me in. This is actually Ken Newman on for Steve. I just had a quick modeling question and I'm not sure if this has been covered already but you had really good flexibility to hedge some changes in FX this quarter, just curious is there any embedded expectations for the impact on foreign exchange to sales or margin within the guide?
Dave Zapico: Yes, for the full-year 2018 on the top-line FX was a benefit of about a point. But for 2019 the full-year FX is a negative 1%. And then when we move to the bottom-line, as we've communicated in the past we're largely naturally hedged at the profit line given the general balance of revenues and costs across currencies. So you won't see a meaningful impact either way on our profitable results from the FX movements, so that's how we model the year and that's been the history of how the business has resulted in operations.
Ken Newman: Got it. And then last one for me, you saw a pretty decent acceleration in the incremental margin for EMG, I think someone else touched on this a little bit before, is there any reason to believe that that could kind of revert back to the same type of incrementals as you saw in the last -- in the first half of 2018 or is this kind of run rate for incremental margin pretty, pretty solid for 2019?
Dave Zapico: Yes, we had a good year in 2018 and we had a good year in Q4, our incrementals were solid at 40%, with our EIG business around 50% and our EMG business around 30%. And then for 2019 we are expecting good solid incrementals but more in the 30% or 35% range.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Eastman: Dave, just kind of reading the body language here through -- your body language through all the responses and questions, as we guide the 3% to 5% core for 2019, I'm curious I mean the tone here is such that the businesses generally stay steady and strong but run up against the comps and so is that largely kind of how you're feeling about the business right now given the backlog, the orders is this -- is the 3% to 5% really kind of the comp issue more so than the tone of business in any of those segments?
Dave Zapico: Yes, I think that is an accurate representation of how we are feeling, Ric.
Richard Eastman: Yes, and like Dunkermotoren, I mean you commented how strong it was in the fourth quarter but I would think of that business as being maybe an early or cyclical kind of indicator, oil and gas maybe the same but no break in trend in those businesses all when you look out to 2019?
Dave Zapico: When you think about Dunkermotoren and think automation and the global macro trends and automation is really a secular trend. So Dunkermotoren is a really strong backlog and is performing exceptionally well. And as I said with oil and gas, it's -- we are positioned now with larger mid and downstream presence to do quite well and that business is performing very well and we're quite a way from our peak so feeling pretty good about that.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Yes, and geographically the 3% to 5% they're pretty much spread across the three major regions in terms of an expectation for 2019?
Dave Zapico: Yes, that's pretty much maybe a little bit better growth in the U.S. but pretty much all geographies are growing at 3% to 5% range.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just last question this might be a little bit more difficult but when you look at AMETEK’s mix of business on next 12 months basis, could you take a swing at what revenue is coming from call it maybe the medical and food exposure that we now have, I mean, it must be north of $0.5 billion, I would presume or --?
Dave Zapico: Yes, our medical exposure is about 13%, 14% of sales and you have to work with Kevin on the food exposure. I'm not a legal expert coming out. So that's combining our process businesses and actually shows up a little bit about in our automation businesses also. But it’s a growing presence and but the medical, the healthcare business is about 13%, 14% of sales and it's performing well for us.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And just last question, in aerospace you may be provided this but in terms of 2019, what's the growth expectation for all of aerospace and do we still lead with commercial and military or as the BizJet piece of the business as a backlog they're built or how do we look at the four segments there against the 2019 forecast?
Dave Zapico: We are expecting growth in all four segments and our guide is positive mid-single-digit growth and we're still seeing strong business in the military and commercial side. So business jet is going to have a solid year but we think we are going to have more strength in commercial and military.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin Coleman for any closing remarks.

David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another spectacular quarter, as our businesses delivered exceptional results across all key operating and financial metrics. In the quarter, double-digit sales growth was driven by another excellent quarter of organic growth. We delivered significant operating margin expansion and robust earnings growth, while again increasing our full-year earnings guidance. We generated a record level of free cash flow and announced that we deployed $565 million on two highly strategic acquisitions. And lastly, given the strength of our acquisition pipeline, we announced an increase on our revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion, providing us added flexibility as we execute on our acquisition strategy. So overall, another outstanding quarter, reflecting the strength of the AMETEK business model, the differentiated nature of our businesses, and the excellent work of the entire AMETEK team. Now, on to the financial and business highlights. Total sales in the third quarter were $1.19 billion, up 10% compared to the third quarter of 2017. Organic sales growth was again very strong at 7%, with acquisitions adding 3% and foreign currency neutral to sales in the quarter. Growth remains broad-based across our businesses, with both our reportable segments growing 7% organically. This organic growth also remains very strong and balanced geographically, with Asia growing 12%, Europe 7%, and the U.S. 6% in the quarter. EBITDA in the third quarter was $312 million, up 14% over the third quarter of 2017, with EBITDA margins a very strong 26.1%. Third quarter operating income was $265.3 million, up 15% over the prior year. Reported operating income margins were up 100 basis points to 22.2%. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, operating margins increased by 130 basis points over the third quarter of last year. Third quarter earnings were $0.82 per diluted share, an increase of 24% over the same period last year, exceeding our guidance of $0.76 to $0.78 per share. Now, turning to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG had a great quarter, with strong growth and exceptional operating performance. Overall sales for EIG in the third quarter were $742 million, up 10% over the same quarter of 2017. Organic sales were up 7%, with recent acquisitions contributing 4%. Foreign currency was a slight headwind to sales in the quarter. Organic growth remains broad-based across our EIG businesses. We saw very strong growth across our process businesses, including Rauland, which has experienced tremendous growth since being acquired in early 2017. Additionally, our Ultra Precision Technologies division had another outstanding quarter, with mid-teens organic sales growth. Operating income for EIG in the quarter was $190.3 million, up 17% over the prior year period. Reported operating income margins were excellent at 25.6%, up a very strong 130 basis points over last year's third quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG margins were up an outstanding 190 basis points over the same quarter of 2017. The Electromechanical Group also had an excellent quarter, with impressive sales growth and margin expansion. EMG sales in the third quarter were $450.9 million, a 9% increase over the same quarter last year. Organic sales growth was very strong, up 7% versus the prior year. The acquisition of FMH Aerospace contributed an additional 2% and foreign currency had no impact on sales. Sales growth remains strong and balanced across each of our key EMG businesses, including automation, aerospace and defense, and engineered materials. EMG's operating income in the third quarter was $92.7 million, up 11% compared to the same quarter in 2017. And operating margins expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year to 20.6%. So, overall, a tremendous performance for AMETEK in the third quarter. Now, let me provide some brief comments on tariffs. On last quarter's conference call, I highlighted the various work streams we were driving to help manage the tariff situation. Our teams are doing a tremendous job managing each of these initiatives and each is progressing as expected. We remain very confident in our ability to mitigate headwinds from announced tariffs, given: number one, our ability to capture incremental pricing due to the highly differentiated nature of our business; number two, the strength and flexibility of our global supply chain; and number three, our ability to shift production given our asset-light business model. AMETEK's proven Operational Excellence capabilities, which captures each of these elements, positions us extremely well to offset the impact from tariffs. More broadly, our Operational Excellence initiatives continued to deliver meaningful productivity and efficiency savings. For all of 2018, we now expect total savings of approximately $90 million from our OPEX initiatives. Our business model also remains focused on generating sustainable, long-term success by investing in our people, investing in our businesses, and investing our strong cash flows in strategic acquisitions. With that said, I would like to take a minute to welcome two new businesses to AMETEK: Telular and Forza. Telular is a high-growth, market-leading provider of communication solutions for logistics management, tank monitoring and security applications. Telular's end-to-end IoT solutions include purpose-built hardware, proprietary software and wireless connectivity services. Their IoT solutions are used to enhance efficiency, lower cost and monitor critical assets in real-time, providing a significant return on investment for their customers. Telular has annual sales of approximately $165 million, with 65% of sales from recurring, subscription-based sales. Their sales are expected to continue to grow at a roughly 10% annual rate, as adoption of Telular's IoT based communication solutions are still in the early stages. In addition to the strength of the Telular business, we see tremendous value in leveraging their IoT capabilities across other AMETEK businesses. Our highly differentiated measurement instrumentation and domain expertise in our niche markets combined with Telular's IoT platform forms the core of an expanded digital strategy for AMETEK and opens up attractive growth opportunities for our businesses. We expect to leverage this platform across other AMETEK businesses where we currently collect, measure and analyze important process variables across mission-critical applications. Telular is headquartered in Chicago, with multiple sales and support locations across the U.S. We deployed approximately $525 million on this acquisition. Now, shifting to Forza. Forza designs and produces specialized solutions for complex image sensors used in medical, defense, commercial and industrial applications. Forza's deep expertise in CMOS imaging technology, combined with their proven design processes, in-house testing capability and supply chain expertise provide the end-to-end ability to design and produce customized next-generation sensor solutions for their customers. One of these customers is our Vision Research business, a market leader in the ultra-high speed cameras for use in scientific research, medical, industrial and military applications. Forza provides Vision Research with custom sensor design and production capability which will accelerate the pace of new sensor development for use on our high-speed cameras. The company has annual sales of approximately $20 million and we deployed approximately $40 million on this acquisition. Including Telular and Forza, we have now acquired five businesses thus far in 2018 and have deployed more than $935 million in capital and acquired approximately $300 million in sales. This is a record level of capital deployment for AMETEK in a year. Even with the strong acquisition activity this year, we're managing a robust pipeline of additional opportunities and have the balance sheet capacity and management bandwidth to remain very active. Our businesses are also doing a tremendous job delivering exciting new products while expanding their presence globally and into new market segments. We're seeing tangible results from this organic growth initiative. Our Ultra Precision Technology (sic) [Ultra Precision Technologies] (00:12:31) division is a good example of this success, as they delivered another quarter of mid-teens organic sales growth. The Ultra Precision Technologies division includes ZYGO, Reichert, Creaform, TMC, Precitech, Solartron, and Taylor Hobson, a highly differentiated group of businesses which provide leading-edge ultra-precise metrology solutions and precision optical products for a diverse set of attractive end markets and applications. With these businesses, developing new technology is key to maintaining their market-leading product and application differentiation, while providing the ability to expand into new market segments. Our Taylor Hobson business, a leader in ultra-precision measurement instruments for a wide range of end markets including optics, aerospace and precision manufacturing, recently launched its PGI NOVUS system. The new system is powered by Metrology 4.0 software and it's the most advanced system available for surface, contour, 3D and diameter measurement. Through this development, Taylor Hobson has addressed many measurement challenges commonly faced by high precision component manufacturers. The new Metrology 4.0 software package delivers a simple intuitive interface with a virtual display and real-time control, enabling a level of monitoring and control that is unprecedented in the industry. Developing new products and solutions like the PGI NOVUS are key in driving sustained organic growth and our businesses are doing a great job on this front. In the third quarter, our vitality index, which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years, was 23%. This reflects a tremendous effort of our more than 1,900 engineers around the globe that are designing and implementing new products and solutions for our customers. Now, onto the outlook for the remainder of the year. Given our outstanding results through the first three quarters of the year and our positive outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect earnings to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.27 per diluted share, an increase of 25% over 2017's adjusted earnings per diluted share. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $3.16 to $3.20. We expect overall sales to be up low-double digits, with organic sales now up mid to high-single digits for all of 2018. For the fourth quarter, overall sales are to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid-single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.84, up 17% to 20% over the same quarter last year. I'm very pleased with the outstanding results that our world-class teams have produced thus far in 2018. AMETEK is firmly positioned to close the year with record results. We are focused on continuing this year's success into the future by executing our four growth strategies. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then, we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an outstanding third quarter with a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial details. In the third quarter, selling expenses were 10.6% of sales versus 10.7% in last year's third quarter, with core selling expenses up in line with core sales growth. General and administrative expenses in the third quarter were up $1.7 million over the prior year due to higher compensation costs. And as a percentage of sales, G&A expenses were 1.5%, in line with last year's level. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.9% versus last year's rate of 24.9% and was in line with our expectations. The year-over-year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of tax reform. We expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full-year estimated rate. Working capital was very solid at 18.2% of sales in the third quarter, up slightly from 17.9% a year ago. Capital expenditures were $19 million for the quarter. We continue to expect full-year capital expenditures to be approximately $85 million or 1.8% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $48 million. For the full-year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $205 million. Third quarter operating cash flow was $249 million and free cash flow was a record $230 million, a very solid conversion of 120% of net income. We continue to expect full-year free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% of net income. The primary use of our strong free cash flow was to support our acquisition strategy. And as Dave mentioned, we've been very active on that front. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we deployed approximately $565 million on the acquisitions of Telular and Forza. These acquisitions bring our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2018 to approximately $935 million. Total debt at September 30 was $1.9 billion, down from $2.17 billion at the end of 2017, as we paid off two maturing senior notes in the quarter totaling $240 million. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $519 million. Even with our record level of capital deployment, including the acquisitions of Telular and Forza, we still have significant capacity with approximately $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. This includes the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended and upsized revolving credit facility we announced today. This amended facility increases the size of our revolving credit facility from $850 million to $1.5 billion and extends the maturity date to October of 2023. This provides us with additional capacity and flexibility to support our acquisition strategy. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the third quarter, which allowed us to deliver high-quality earnings growth and again raise our full-year guidance. We remain well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Andrew, could we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D. A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you. A couple of questions. First, even into the month of October, Dave, have you seen any signs of slowing in your business and semiconductor in China? And then, would you be willing to provide at this point any high-level thoughts in terms of how you're thinking about 2019?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The first question, October finished right on plan. It was a very strong orders month. It exceeded our expectations in fact a bit and so we're very, very happy with that. We just got the numbers this morning. In terms of the semiconductor market, it's about 5% of AMETEK and it's performing very well. And we have some very specialized capability and we are selling to the Chinese semiconductor market, but we have seen no slowdown in that regard and we're expecting that to continue. And regarding 2019, I'm really not in a position to speak to the specifics about 2019 at this point in time. We'll be meeting with our businesses during November and December to hear from each of them. As you know, we operate in a variety of niche markets and we need to understand what is going on in each of these businesses to have a bottoms-up view from our budgeting process before giving any guidance.
Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.: And then as my follow-up, Dave, can you talk about what realized price was in Q3 and what the spread between price versus cost was for you guys? Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure, Matt. Sure. We had an excellent quarter in terms of price. In Q3, we achieved price of about 2.2% across our entire portfolio. And total inflation have picked up a bit. It was about 1.4%. And we saw positive spread of about 80 basis points. So we're very pleased with these results. The results speak to the highly differentiated nature of the AMETEK product portfolio, our leadership position in niche markets and our focus and determination to make sure we stay in front of a changing global economic environment with pricing outpacing inflation.
Matt J. Summerville - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you, David.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, and congrats on a continued excellent year.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Curious about Telular versus the other two communication solutions deals. Almost seems like it maybe discreetly different space. So, wondering if it does gel with those other deals. And then also update Dave Zapico vision of adjacencies, maybe communication solutions strikes me, wouldn't have fallen in the range of the AME concept of adjacencies in the not-too-distant past.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. It's a great question, Chris. I mean, when we look at Telular, we see a business that checks a lot of boxes for us. It's a market leader in niche markets. It's a differentiated technology solutions business. It has very good secular growth, growing about 10% a year the last three years. It has a sizable recurring revenue stream. That's a bit new. It's very profitable, mid-20s EBITDA, with room for margin expansion. So we see very good cost synergy opportunities. We also see opportunities to expand the business internationally. They've had so much growth that they've just concentrated on the U.S., and we have the capability to help them expand internationally. But aside from the Telular, Telular is a good business in its own right. It also provides something else to AMETEK. It enables a broad set of AMETEK businesses to deliver IoT solutions when combined – when you combine AMETEK's sensor technology with Telular's IoT capability, it really creates a new growth avenue for all of our businesses. So we're very excited about them.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Wanted to ask you about the orders in the quarter organically by segment.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay. The total reported orders were up 6%. The organic orders were up 5% and both groups were up mid-single digits.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got you. Also, I see that the operating excellence number went up to $90-plus million.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Could you talk a little bit about operating excellence more broadly, particularly not just how you got there, which I assume includes some hurrying of things on the tariffs side, but also how operating excellence being it's now stretched over the sales functions, how that is adding to sales?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. The first point is, as you know, we had a $85 million target for total cost savings working through the P&L and we increased it to $90 million in my prepared remarks. And that's really about $70 million is going to come from our supply chain and about $20 million from other Operational Excellence initiatives and really are continuing doing a great job and they're handling that work along with the tariffs and it really speaks to the capability of our teams. Regarding the expansion of the commercial excellence initiatives that we've been working on for some time, now we're seeing really good traction. I mean, Bill and I are going around and visiting the businesses and seeing the attributes of growth kaizen, the focus on the aftermarket, improved digital marketing. It's a big part of our leadership development now. We just finished our leadership development processes and making sure that we're doing the proper things to develop our sales and marketing talent. So, it's really a comprehensive approach to improving the organic growth of the businesses. It's going extremely well and we're still in the early innings of that. So we're very positive of what's going on.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So one of the things that – I'd just tuck this in very quickly on that because I know how important this is internally. One of the things that a couple of your competitors do is to really kind of train salespeople to more efficiently generate leads as well as shrinking the time to create an order out of that, giving them a critical path, and then delivering on that order, obviously, on time full spec, the whole thing. Could you just sort of tuck in how AMETEK beyond the four things you just mentioned is addressing sort of let's say the front end of sales lead process?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I think the lead process would be – all of our businesses are out there with their sales forces generating leads. And what we've done is we've really enhanced our digital marketing lead capability, so we'll take all of our leads and we'll make sure that we'll generate more leads. We'll make sure that they're properly dispositioned. We'll follow up on them to make sure that we're getting good return on our advertising dollars or the way that we're marketing our products. So lead generation and lead follow-up is a big part of that – big part of the program we have to accelerate internal growth. So it's a core component of what I'd say, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That's great. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities: Hey guys, good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Allison.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities: Just want to go back to Telular. I know you gave a mix of new versus recurring revenue, not sure if you touched on this, but the hardware versus software component, how should we think about that?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The Telular solution provides – it requires both hardware and software. So you have a situation where you're providing hardware and also software and connectivity are provided to the service, and there's an annual subscription. So I would say it's not a classic SaaS business, but it has elements of the SaaS business, and the software and the algorithms and the analytics with the software are linked with the hardware. So it's a good fit for AMETEK because, as you know, the hardware part of the world is what we're really good at. And with all of our sensors and instrumentation businesses, that's what we're doing out there all the time. And adding the IoT capability to those businesses is something we're very excited about. Also, Telular, they have a best-of-breed IoT solution, but with sensor technologies, they were struggling to a certain degree and that's really our expertise. So the combination of both businesses is a wonderful strategic fit.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities: Great. And then you'd also touched on Asia growing nicely. Any noted changes in China over the past few, I guess, weak season, where are your successes over there, any issues on the other side? I know you talked about (00:30:30).
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. No, that's a great question, Allison. I mean, the China was – it grew nicely for us in the quarter. It drove the overall sales growth of Asia. It was a bit higher than the overall Asia sales growth. And the tariff situation related to the demand side which China adds complexity that we're watching closely. So far there's no impact, but we'll continue to monitor it closely and our teams over there are bullish. And really, if you think about it and you take a step back and operate at maybe 30,000 feet, we have the capability that lets China improve their manufacturing capability, to move up the value chain. That's what our process businesses do and those businesses are doing very well in China. So, we're not seeing a slowdown right now, but we're watching it closely.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks. That's helpful.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Just a follow-up on Allison's last question there, could you calibrate and update us on what you think the tariff impact is? Last quarter, you said less than $0.01 for the third and fourth quarter. Where does that stand today?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. Yeah, yeah. In Q3, the situation played out a little better than we expected. We had a little less than $0.01 from direct impact from tariffs, and we offset that with price. So we got ahead of it. We expect a similar situation to play out in Q4. We'll have a little bit higher direct impact. It'll be about $0.01 from the tariffs, but we feel we largely have it covered with our initiatives and we're effectively managing through it.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. That's nice work on price cost as well. And Dave, you gave an interesting data point last quarter, and this has been the raging debate in the sector as to where we are in the cycle and there's a lot of market sentiments thinking we're at peak cycle, but you were pretty adamant last quarter citing fourth inning. And I know the Red Sox have wrapped up another World Series and so maybe we'll stay with your baseball analogy.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Do you dare talk about another – where we are in terms of innings as you see it today?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I think it's the bottom of the fourth and the home team's up. I mean, we came out of the recession strong. We see no slowdown in our business so – and it looks really optimistic. So it still feels good to us.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. That's certainly coming through in your orders in October. So we'll leave it there. And then, just the last question is, an idea that's come up a number of times, investors have asked us is, when would you all consider moving to cash EPS? It strikes us as a number of just most of your growth by acquisition peers have all similarly switched, whether it's Danaher, Fortive, Dover, Roper. And again, we know it doesn't change any of the fundamentals, but certainly optically it puts you on a level playing field in this peer group and is this something that you all would consider?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes. We would consider it, Deane. We considered it last year, and we decided not to do it. And we also talked to additional investors through the course of this year. So we'll evaluate it and we'll decide what we're going to do at year-end. That would probably be a good time, and we'll let you know what we're going to do. Last year, we decided not to do it, because there are varying opinions of investors and our long-term investors matter a lot to us, and we're a GAAP company and we're proud of that. We have very little adjustments to our financial statements, but we also hear what investors are saying on the cash EPS. So we're evaluating it and we'll make a decision at year-end to do it or not do it like we did last year.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And just it's clear from our perspective that we think it would be a good idea, but we appreciate all the color. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you. Your input is noted.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning, all.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Morning, Brett.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Morning, Brett.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Just want to come back to the M&A pipeline. I guess as you think about the types of deals you're looking at, is this software-based type deal that you're announcing today more opportunistic, or are you seeing a tilt of the pipeline towards deals with more software or recurring elements, and maybe just a finer point on the size of deals you're evaluating?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Software, AMETEK's always been excellent at software within our niche businesses. And we have a tremendous capability and a lot of proprietary software as to the value proposition, we deliver for our customers. And we've talked in prior calls about our center in India with about now close to 150 software engineers developing software for all of our businesses. And with some of the trends going on in the market, we've been looking for quite some time for an IoT type business. And we saw companies that were either very good at sensors who developed an IoT capability or companies that were very good at IoT capabilities that weren't good at sensors. And since we were good at sensors and we wanted the capability, we think we found a great fit in Telular. And I think that it's a secular business and software is going to become more important as we move forward within AMETEK's portfolio. That's a fact. But we're still looking in all the ponds that we've been fishing for in the past. And we're not a wholesale changing the direction; we found just a great business that we could get a good return on the business itself and the unique situation and it adds capability to many of the AMETEK businesses. So we're looking forward to getting to work on that.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Did you have another question, Brett?
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah. Just one more follow-up and then – just in terms of the value chain, I mean obviously AMETEK plays a few links up in a lot of the served markets. But any sense of pre-buying, buy the value chain or parts of the chain ahead of price increases? And maybe just a little more color on the state of inventories relative to production schedules there.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah, we may not be the best company to get that input from because we're building largely customized products. So there isn't a lot of buy ahead in terms of our products because they're purpose-built to the customer requirements. So we don't see a lot of that typically in our businesses. And in the places that we could see that, we're not seeing it right now. So, it's a healthy environment. Customers have money. Customers are putting it to work and they're keeping up with their demand, is the way that we're looking at it.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. I'll pass it along. Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Brett.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just first question in terms of all the deals that you've done this year, could you help us with the math how accretive it is to 2019 numbers?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The first year we do a deal, there's a lot of restructuring, there's a lot of purchase accounting and they usually don't add that much to the capability – the earnings in the next year. I would point you – at this point, we haven't completed our work for 2019, but I could see a similar level of accretion that we had last year. And I think we've pointed everyone to a $0.06-type number, and I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't end up like something like that. But a company like Telular is going to add something more later in the year because of all the acquisition step-ups and the purchase accounting required and the plans we have for the business.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got you. And another question, we get a lot of questions about your aerospace and defense and energy exposure. Could you remind us – could you just talk a little bit more about each one and what are you seeing in both markets in terms of growth this year, backlog and outlook, because it seems there's a lot of sort of operating and cyclical leverage there? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Our aerospace – our overall aerospace business was up mid-teens in the third quarter. And it was driven by contributions from the recently acquired FMH Aerospace and high-single digit organic sales growth in the aerospace group. We saw solid and balanced growth across our various aerospace markets, with notable strength on our commercial and military businesses. You may recall that AMETEK's about 35% military, about 25% commercial, about 30% third-party MRO and about 10% business jet. So with commercial and military markets doing well, that's good for us. And for all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales for our aerospace business to be up mid-single digits, with growth across each segment. So we're feeling really good about our aerospace business. In recent years, we won a lot of content on Airbus airframes in the commercial world, and now with the military market coming back to life and a solid spending environment both the U.S. and international for military, its general spending to improve fleet readiness, but we've also had major design wins on the F-35 and a lot of important programs. And we're not dependent on any one program, but the military market is really changed from what it was a couple of years ago and we're doing very well with it. In terms of oil and gas, you mentioned that also, oil and gas now is about 6% of AMETEK. In Q3, it was up mid-single digit. And for the full year, we expect sales to be up mid to high-single digits, with the upstream up low-double digits and the mid and downstream up low to mid-single digits. And at $65 oil, we see solid business activity. The international components of it are picking up. We're about one-third U.S., two-thirds international; about 25% upstream, 75% mid and downstream. So the business feels solid. We see it just slowly incrementally getting stronger and we feel positive about the exposure.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just on energy, just a follow-up, how far off the peak are we now?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. We were – at peak, we were about $400 million, and now we're at about $280 million. So we're still roughly $120 million from the peak.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Terrific. Thank you so much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: So just want to kind of weigh in on this cash EPS debate. I mean, GAAP – obviously GAAP earnings is the gold standard. But I think you mentioned $205 million amortization this year. I think that looks more like $220 million, $230 million next year. It's becoming a really big number. I mean, I think that number was about $145 million of D&A in 2015. So, I think, as you do these larger deals and (00:43:01) deals, it's becoming a much more disconnected number from economic reality. So, for what it's worth, we fully support a move to cash EPS, but just wanted to make that very clear.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: Good. Anyway, so first question on China, you got a pretty broad footprint in China, quite a large proportion of your sales. What are you seeing in China? It doesn't sound like there's any slowdown that you've seen in 3Q, but any areas of concern? You mentioned – you called out semi as remaining very strong to you, but any areas of concern in China.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The concern is really what's going to happen with the overall trade situation. Obviously, people in China are nervous about this situation, but the business activity at least for our businesses are still continuing very strongly. We're selling into that market with products that the Chinese economy needs. And in the semiconductor market, in the nuclear instrumentation market, in the advanced process market, we're helping improve their production efficiencies. So we're definitely seeing a positive market and we're doing well over there, but it's just the overall global overhang that adds the complexity and we're watching it closely, but we haven't seen an impact so far in demand.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then going back to Telular, there's been a lot of questions on it so far. If I missed it I'm sorry, but what are the margins, EBITDA margins for that business?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. They were mid-20% EBITDA margins.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: Mid-20% EBITDA, okay. And the growth profile and just one final question on that would be, I think the background of this business was in the residential and commercial electronic security markets, but it's branched into industrial. How does that mix look today?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The residential part of Telular is about 20% of the business. So what they did is, the foundation of the business many years ago was mainly in the commercial and residential market and that business has been a strong cash flow generator, and they found a nice niche to operate in, but they've grown the industrial market around it. So the non-residential piece is about 80%. The residential piece is about 20%. And there also is a growth driver in that – the non-industrial piece is to grow through the – there's a UL Standard, that's an approved standard for wireless sole path fire alarm monitoring and that business is going well. And that business sells to 5,000 dealers and it's a very good business. They're agnostic to any other brands and they have carved out a nice little niche that results in a solid recurring revenue stream. So really we'll have the same strategy that Telular had is using that business to generate very strong cash flow with strong sticky customer relationships and growing the industrial piece of Telular aggressively. And that's the same model that Telular brings to AMETEK. It's just a well thought out model.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: Great. Thank you. And then just one final one, does your guidance anticipate any 4Q restructuring?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Not that we know of at this time. I mean, certainly there's some – the Tax Reform and Job Acts (sic) [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] (00:46:18) gives you till the year-end to finalize the accounting related to tax reform. So we'll be looking at that. And there are no current plans for realignment, but certainly we're going to be going through our budgeting process next two months. And if there are good projects that our businesses want to do, then we could be in a situation, but we don't have anything planned at this time.
Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC: Great. Thanks, David.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sawyer Rice with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I'll let go the sentiments on cash EPS there, but maybe to dig a little deeper on some of the tariffs. Looks like you guys have done a good job so far in managing that. Maybe any early thoughts here on 2019, maybe how much of your supply chain do you see as tariffed at this point? And then can you maybe update us if we do see List 3 jumping to 25%, what the impact here could be for 2019? Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. It's a dynamic situation, Sawyer. I mean, we're working on a number of initiatives. We've been very successful in Q3. We expect a similar situation in Q4. We're assuming in our budget model it's going to go from 10% to 25% in List 3. And we're also putting plans in place so that we understand the List 4 impact, but it's very dynamic and we're effectively managing through it. And I'm confident that's going to continue because of the things that I talked about in my prepared remarks. We really have pricing leverage to deal with tariffs because of the unique differentiated nature of our portfolio. We have an excellent supply chain capability around the world that are executing very well right now. And finally, if we get in a situation where we want to move our product line and we have a couple of product lines that we're in the process of moving, we have an asset-light business model where we don't have a lot of stranded fixed investments. We can move products to other low-cost regions around the world. So I feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to manage through this. 2019 is a very dynamic situation and I don't want to give any information related to that yet. But we'll find that out during our process, during November and December.
Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the additional color there and congrats on the quarter.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Sawyer.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning. Dave, could you provide maybe an update on the EMIP business, just curious how that's acting from a demand standpoint? And then also is there anything from a metals perspective, prices have been up, they seem to be stabilizing, that's moving the margins around in there. Is there any concern around the margin line and maybe just what the demand is for the EMIP business?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. There is an element of the EMIP business where we pass on the cost of the metals business and that's working in the P&L. But as you saw, we had the 50 basis points improvement in core margins. So even with that, we're able to grow margins. The EMIP demand is very strong. I mean, we're up a bit more than EMG in the third quarter. So we're up 7% at EMG. We're up a bit more at EMIP. And our customers are optimistic. We're seeing strong demand in aerospace, medical and specialized industrial. As you mentioned, there are some inflationary impacts in metals, and – but we're dealing with that. And I think, in the case of oil and gas, there was – we still had not recovered to our peak. I believe in the case of the metals business, we're not at our peak yet, but we're much closer. So we had – I think at the trough, that was down maybe $125 million, and I think now we're within $20 million of our peak. So total metals are about $480 million and the peak was $500 million. So we're getting back to that, but still have some room to go and the demand is strong.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. And then just – I just want to double back for a second to the aerospace business in general. Given the long cycle nature of that business, can you just kind of characterize – I know we don't want to touch 2019 here in terms of growth rate, but one would assume that maybe that business in 2019 tracks at least at 2018's growth rate with backlog and kind of demand on the military side and commercial backlogs. Is that a fair way to look at that business that you've got pretty good visibility there from the backlog and the demand into 2019? Is it best guess to be mid-single digits?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I think when you take a step back and commercial market is about 25% of our aerospace exposure, and we're on the right aircraft and the business is performing very well. And about half of that business is proprietary aftermarket. So that commercial business looks good for the foreseeable future. I mean, the big change is the military business. We're on most military aircraft. We both have a domestic and an international component. The military business is, as I said before, it's picking up and it's strong. The business jet market was kind of down for a long period of time. The orders seem to be picking up there. So I think it's green lights for the aerospace business for AMETEK, I would say, for the foreseeable future.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just two last questions. Around Europe, could you remind us what – when you look at AMETEK's business and you look at EMEA, is the business slanted towards or weighted towards EIG or EMG in EMEA?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, it's really balanced. I mean the big thing you have for EMG, you have our Dunkermotoren business and that's a big, big component of EMG. In the quarter, we saw our strongest growth in the automation in the Dunkermotoren PMC business, and we also saw strong growth in EIG with our Materials Analysis business doing very well. So in Europe, it's kind of like as a microcosm of AMETEK in the whole world. We have some major instrument businesses in the UK, in Germany and in France, and we have substantial manufacturing presences in those regions, and we also have a substantial business and operating capability with our Dunkermotoren businesses for EMG in Germany. So it's really about the same proportions of the whole company.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just my last quick question, regarding Telular, do they have any OE sales? What is that – how do they get to market?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, they have a direct-to-market with customers and they sell to a variety of end markets in the...
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Do they sell to any other OE, like automation vendors?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No. In the – no, they're selling their solutions directly to end customers. They're getting long-term contracts from end customers. They're managing...
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: ...both the hardware, the communication services and the software. Now, on the business that goes after commercial and residential security that I talked about, the 20% residential, that's a different channel, and that goes to about a network of 5,000 dealers. And those are smaller, regional, independent companies. So, there's kind of two different channels depending on the two different businesses.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And presumably given the channels and that mix, that 20-80 mix, in that 10% kind of CAGR sales expectation, there's pricing there as well, you have pretty good pricing flexibility there as well?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. It's the same as any AMETEK business I'd say. Yeah.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Morning, Joe.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess as a former CPA, I give condolences to the death of GAAP here, but (00:55:07). Yeah, I think you guys have been pushed pretty hard on – is there a negative inflection anywhere in your business and you've been pretty consistent with your answers. But Dave, can you talk about what are the things that you kind of look at to gauge those inflections? Like, where are the most sensitive businesses that you would kind of look for, because others are seeing something and you guys are still seeing kind of accelerating, and at least stable growth. So where are you? And what would you start doing if those businesses started to shift a little bit? What would be your first couple actions to take?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Well, yeah, I mean, AMETEK is known for our Operational Excellence capabilities. So if we saw a downturn, we would not shy away from getting in front of it and managing the costs aggressively. So that would be what we would do. In terms of – we're mainly a group of mid and long cycle businesses and we don't see that right now. But certainly, if there was a canary in the coal mine in our business that used to be our cost-driven motors business, but now that's a small, very small fraction of what it was and the demand in that business is still holding up very well. So we don't see demand turning negative right now. But if it does, that's what AMETEK's good at. We manage costs, we get in front of it and we have a team of seasoned operators that realize that.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then as far as M&A, this seems interesting with acquiring a company with an IoT solution that was a little bit weak with sensors where you guys can come in. But with your core being on metrology, where do you consider like a bridge too far? Like, when do you start straying from what you guys are really good at and getting into other things that are more recurring because they might be good financial decision?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. Yeah, I think about it in terms of the adjacency road maps that we build for each of our businesses. And those are adjacency road maps that will look in near adjacencies and I consider this business to be that. So close adjacencies are always the ones that you know best and the ones you have the least risk with and we're cognizant of that. So I don't think we'll be buying businesses that we have no knowledge of or affiliation with. But certainly, there's an expanded group of opportunities and the opportunity set's expanded. And we have a broad set of niche businesses that we have adjacency maps for. So I think you'll see more of the same. We're doing businesses. Some of the deals that we've done recently have been more secular. Some of the deals that we've done more recently have been more technology-oriented. We're also doing a lot of tuck-ins that enhance our market positions. And we have a really good pipeline right now. And as Bill mentioned earlier, we have a strong balance sheet and we're actively looking at some properties right now.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then just last from me quick, can you maybe touch on the few businesses that we haven't discussed yet? I think...
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, sure.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: ...maybe power and industrial overall and process as an overall?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I'll go through – we covered aerospace already (58:16) process. Our process businesses had a very strong quarter. Overall sales were up low-double digits, driven by high-single digit organic sales growth and contributions from the SoundCom acquisition. Rauland which was acquired in February 2017 continues to see robust demand for their communication solutions across their key health care and educational markets. It's driving strong organic growth. That team has really, really (00:58:47) fantastic job. And we mentioned also in my prepared remarks our UPT, our Ultra Precision Technologies business, in particular ZYGO, TMC, Precitech and Taylor Hobson, all saw strong double-digit growth in the quarter. So for all of 2018, we now expect organic sales for our process business is to be up mid to high-single digits. So we increased the outlook for our process business to mid to high-single digits from mid-single digits. And if I go to power and industrial, overall sales were up low-double digits in the quarter, driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of Arizona Instrument and Motec, along with low single-digit organic sales growth. We saw very solid growth across our power, test and measurement businesses in the quarter. That includes our programmable power and VTI businesses. And for all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up mid-single digits. And finally, we saw good growth across our automation and engineered solutions business. It remains solid with high-single digit organic growth, but that business is doing really well benefiting from the global secular trends in automation. Dunkermotoren and Haydon Kerk continue to do an excellent job, expanding their growth funnels by targeting new precision automation applications. And in 2018, we continue to expect high-single digit organic sales growth for automation and engineered solutions businesses. That's around the horn, Joe.

David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK's results in the second quarter were superb. We reported record sales with very strong organic growth and excellent contributions from recent acquisitions. We ended the quarter with a record level of backlog following another quarter of strong orders growth. We delivered excellent operating performance, resulting in record level EBITDA, record operating income, significant margin expansion, and sizable growth in diluted earnings per share. We also completed another acquisition in the quarter, continuing to deploy a robust free cash flow on strategic acquisitions. Given these outstanding results, we have again raised our guidance for 2018. So overall, just a fantastic quarter with very high quality results. Now on to the financial highlights. Total sales in the second quarter were a record $1.21 billion, up 14% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Organic sales were up 7%, acquisitions added 5%, and foreign currency was a two-point tailwind. We are very pleased with the organic growth as it remains broad based across our businesses and geographies. Orders growth was also very solid in the quarter. Overall orders were up 8% with organic orders up 5% even with a difficult comparison from the second quarter of 2017. As a result, we finished the second quarter with a record backlog of $1.6 billion. EBITDA in the second quarter was a record $317.6 million, up 17% over the second quarter of 2017 with EBITDA margins are very strong 26.3%. Operating income in the second quarter was a record $270.1 million, up 18% over the prior year. Reported operating income margins were up 70 basis points to 22.3%. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, operating margins were up an impressive 110 basis points over the second quarter last year. This level of margin expansion speaks to the excellent operating leverage our businesses generate. Second quarter earnings were $0.83 per diluted share, up an outstanding 28% compared to the same period last year, and above our guidance of $0.76 to $0.78 per share. Now, turning to the individual operating groups, first, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG had an excellent second quarter with strong sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG in the second quarter were a record $744.5 million, up 13% over the same quarter of 2017. Organic sales were up 6% and recent acquisitions also contributed 6%. Foreign currency was a 1% benefit to EIG sales in the quarter. While growth was broad based across our EIG businesses, we saw a particularly strong organic growth across our Ultra Precision Technologies division. Second quarter operating income for EIG was $193.8 million, up 18% over the prior year. Reported operating income margins were excellent at 26%, up 110 basis points over the second quarter of 2017. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG margins were up an exceptional 180 basis points over the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also had a fantastic quarter with record sales and operating results. EMG sales in the quarter were a record $464.5 million, up 14% over the same period last year. Organic sales growth was excellent at 9% with solid demand across our engineered materials and thermal management systems businesses. The acquisition of FMH Aerospace contributed an additional 3% and foreign currency provided a 2% benefit in the quarter. Operating income in the second quarter was a record $94.3 million, an 11% increase compared to the second quarter of 2017. Operating margins were strong at 20.3% for the quarter. In summary, AMETEK delivered another outstanding quarter. Our teams are performing at a very high level and remain focused on delivering high quality results. We remain committed to investing in our businesses and our people to generate sustained long-term success for our shareholders. We also remain committed to deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions where we can leverage the AMETEK business model to drive meaningful improvements. And we have had a strong first half of the year on the acquisition front, completing three deals and deploying approximately $370 million in capital. As a quick recap, in January, we expanded the capabilities of our aerospace and defense businesses through the acquisition of FMH Aerospace, a leading provider of highly engineered and differentiated components for use in the aerospace, defense and space markets. In April, we announced the acquisition of SoundCom, which designs, integrates, and services clinical workflow and communication systems for end users in the health care, government, and educational markets. SoundCom was a wonderful addition to our growing health care solutions platform as a value-added reseller for Rauland-Borg, the leading local provider of mission critical clinical communications and workflow solutions to hospitals, health care systems, and educational facilities. Rauland has experienced a very strong growth since being acquired in the first quarter of 2017, with organic sales up low double digits in the second quarter. Rauland is seeing robust demand for its market leading communication solutions and has done a fantastic job leveraging AMETEK's business system to improve its profitability. In addition to FMH and SoundCom, we recently completed the acquisition of Motec, a leading provider of vision systems for the high growth mobile machine vision market. Headquartered in Germany, Motec provides integrated vision systems that combine ruggedized mobile cameras with advanced software to improve operational efficiency and enhance safety. These applications are used in a variety of end markets, including automation, agriculture, transportation, defense, and logistics. Motec's differentiated solutions nicely complement our Instrumentation and Specialty Controls business, and provide AMETEK with a leadership position in this very high growth adjacent market segment. Motec has annual sales of approximately $35 million and we deployed approximately $95 million on the acquisition. Our acquisition teams are managing a very active acquisition pipeline and we remain focused on deploying our strong free cash flow on strategic acquisitions. Given our balance sheet strength, plus the additional flexibility resulting from tax reform, we are in a strong position to pursue additional acquisition opportunities and are very excited about the opportunities in our pipeline. We are also very excited about the success of our organic growth initiatives as our businesses are seeing very positive results from these efforts. While our end markets remain strong, our excellent organic sales growth indicates our efforts to enhance our sales and marketing processes and a continued focus on new product development are having a positive impact. One example of the success of our efforts can be seen across our Ultra Precision Technologies division. This division includes a tremendous set of highly differentiated businesses, with leading edge technologies and solutions, providing ultra precise metrology solutions and precision optical products for an attractive set of markets and applications. As noted earlier, these businesses have delivered tremendous results recently with robust growth in both sales and orders. This growth reflects the strength of their technology in niche leadership positions across the markets they serve. These businesses are capturing incremental market share as a result of their global and market expansion initiatives, and success with their new product development efforts. As an example, Creaform, a pioneer in 3D scanning measurement technology, recently unveiled their latest coordinate measuring machine, known as the CUBE-R. The CUBE-R is a complete turnkey solution that provides fast, precise, and automated 3D measurement capability for a shop floor environment. Utilizing Creaform's MetraSCAN 3D metrology scanner, along with the efficiency and reliability of robotic automated industrial measuring cell, the CUBE-R can measure and inspect parts and components up to three meters in length with metrology grade accuracy. This solution is allowing our customers to enhance their quality control in a reliable, safe, and efficient manner. New products and solutions like the CUBE-R continue to be a key driver for sustained organic growth and AMETEK's long-term success. Our vitality index, which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years, is one way to measure the success of our research, development, and engineering efforts. Through the first half of the year, our vitality index was excellent at 23%, reflecting the tremendous work of our teams to design and implement these new products and solutions. In 2018, we expect to increase our RD&E investment by 6% year-over-year to approximately $235 million. Before providing our updated outlook for 2018, I wanted to provide a few comments on the global trade situation. While tariffs have had a minimal effect on our business thus far, we do expect that incremental headwinds will need to be managed as tariffs are implemented and supply chains adjust. We are confident in our ability to largely mitigate these headwinds, given our ability to capture incremental pricing due to the highly differentiated nature of our businesses, plus the strength and flexibility of our global supply chain. The situation remains fluid and uncertain, but what we know now at this point, we expect the net impact of tariffs to be only a modest headwind for the balance of 2018, and this headwind is reflected in our guidance. Now, on to the outlook. Given our outstanding performance in the first half of the year and our positive outlook for the back half of 2018, we now expect earnings to be in the range of $3.16 to $3.20 per diluted share, up 21% to 23% from 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.61. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $3.06 to $3.12. We continue to expect AMETEK overall sales to be up low double digits with organic sales up mid-single digits for all of 2018, with EIG organic sales also up mid-single digits, and EMG organic sales up high single digits. For the third quarter, overall sales are projected to be up high single digits with organic sales up mid-single digits compared to the same quarter of 2017. Third quarter diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $0.76 to $0.78, up 15% to 18% over the prior year period. To summarize, AMETEK's performance through the first six months of the year was outstanding. We are firmly positioned to deliver record results in 2018 and continued success in the long-term, backed by our world class teams and focus on executing our four growth strategies. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an excellent second quarter with record results and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial details. In the second quarter, core selling expenses were up in line with core sales growth. Our second quarter general and administrative expenses were down modestly compared to 2017 and as a percentage of sales were 1.5%, down from last year's level of 1.8% of sales. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.9% versus last year's rate of 26%. The year-over-year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of tax reform. We expect our 2018 tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Working capital was very solid at 17.2% of sale from the second quarter, down from 17.9% of sales a year ago. Capital expenditures were $16 million for the quarter, and for the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $85 million or 1.8% of sales. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $49 million. And for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $200 million. Second quarter operating cash flow was $203 million and free cash flow was $187 million. For the first six months of 2018, free cash flow was up 12% over the prior year period. And for the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% of net income. As Dave mentioned, we've been very active on the acquisition front, deploying approximately $370 million on the acquisitions of FMH Aerospace, SoundCom, and Motec thus far in 2018. Total debt at June 30 was $2.15 billion, down slightly from the end of 2017. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $558 million, resulting in a net debt to EBITDA ratio as of June 30 of approximately 1.3 times. Following the three acquisitions we completed this year, we have more than $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, the performance from our businesses during the second quarter was outstanding. We delivered record level results with a high quality of earnings, and we remain well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Bill. Glenda, could we please open the line for questions?
Operator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, Scott, you're coming in clear.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Very good. Well done on the quarter.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I have two questions for you. I know you position the organic orders of up 5% as facing a tough comp, and certainly we know that orders tend to be lumpy. You've had double-digit in the past and all this. Is there anything at all, Dave, that we should be reading into the plus 5%, the slower?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No. I think Q2 orders were strong, Scott. We had a positive book-to-bill in the quarter of 1.02, up mid-single digits, some tough comps. You remember that in Q2 2017, we had 12% organic growth. And the mid-single-digit growth was broad based. Both our EIG and our EMG businesses were both balanced and up in orders. And if you recall in our EMG business in Q1, there was a little bit of a seasonality factor. But the nature of that business being OEM customers, will replace the order for the balance of the year. So, that was really – that strongly happened in Q1. And we also saw some military orders in Q1 related to our TMS business. And as you know, those can be very lumpy. So, there's nothing at all to worry about. There's a very strong orders growth, broad based, positive book-to-bill, and is balanced across the business.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Thank you. My follow-up is essentially on the tariffs. So, we have a strategy of moving production to low-cost facilities, low-cost areas. So, I guess I was a little bit surprised to hear you say nominal impact and all of that, when you do a fair amount of manufacturing in China for markets that are not in China. Could you kind of maybe go through how you get to only a small or nominal impact in the second half?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. It's a great question, and our executive office has been actively involved in managing the situation with our business teams. So, we start from a great position because of our business model and the capabilities we have. As you know, we have niche differentiated businesses with low CapEx requirements by design. So, our model provides pricing power, combined with a flexible operating structure. And capability-wise, we have one of the best supply chain organizations in the business. So, we're really well-positioned from capability, and we've currently been working on several work streams. There's resourcing activities ongoing, obviously, supplier negotiations. There's a few relocation of production locations. If you export from the U.S., which you know we do, and you import components that have a tariff, you can go through the duty drawback process and recollect just about the entire tariff. We've also built a bit of inventory ahead of the tariffs to avoid paying the tariffs that were implemented in July. And based on everything we know, we have less than $0.01 impact in both Q3 and Q4, and that includes not only the tariffs on steel and aluminum, but the Section 301, and that even includes the proposed $200 billion that was proposed at 10% on a bunch of different items. Now, that can change, but we've also factored that into. So, with our capability and our capability of price, and our capability in our supply chain, I feel very comfortable we're ideally situated to manage the tariff situation and it's a process, and we now have a great process in place.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And the productivity savings, I think last quarter, you said about $85 million. Is that intact?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No. We're still going to get $85 million. We're having a strong year and we'll still get $85 million. Our supply chain teams have this additional load, but we're still going to get the $85 million.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Hey. Question on Motec. I'm just reading the description of it, wondering if that is somewhat of a direct play on the electrical vehicle market. And also given the high growth profile of it, just wondering if you measure the trend line in terms of expanding pipeline of opportunities, given probably some longer spec cycles there?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, Motec's a great business, Chris. And it's not so much on electric vehicles, but it is on the embedded mobile machine market. It's a leading provider of vision systems. So, their products improve operational efficiency and enhance safety. They have integrated vision systems combined with ruggedized cameras for harsh environments, electronic hardware and software for high speed video processing, and unique proprietary algorithms for applications that automate and make mobile machines safer. So, when you put those three factors together, the ruggedized cameras, the video processing, and the software and the algorithms, they're really in a unique position in a burgeoning market that has good long-term growth drivers. And the business has been growing at 20%-plus a year for the last three years. Their end markets are balanced across transportation, ag, logistics, construction, military vehicles. They're very unique applications, where they're helping their customers improve the quality and safety of their operations, very strong capability in engineering. The company's headquartered in Germany. The majority of their sales are in Europe. And it fits very well with our ISC business. So, the sales channel opportunities for both businesses are really good. So, we're really optimistic. We bought it from two private founders. The competitors are relatively small. They're well-positioned, and we're really optimistic what we're going to be able to do with the business.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Sounds cool. And my next one is, have you seen any platforms that are starting to feel toppy or tapering off in terms of business units, markets, or geographies as you look around, just given you have pretty widespread breadth?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question, Chris. I mean when you look at our business, both our EIG and EMG business are up mid-single digits or better. If you look at all of our market areas, and Scott didn't ask that question, but if you look at all of our market areas in the process, aerospace, power and industrial, and automated and engineering, all those businesses are up mid-single digits or better. If you go around the world, all the geographies are up mid-single digits or better. So, we're feeling very optimistic and we're not seeing any sign of slowdown.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: That sounds good. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Just like to circle back on the price/cost and tariffs, and it sounds like that's all being well managed. Just a couple real specifics is because you have such leadership in these niche differentiated markets, we typically associate that with good pricing power. Can you share with us any pricing actions that you've taken? What kind of schedule, feedback, or acceptance from customers? But color on that would be really helpful.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure, Deane. In Q2, we achieved price of 1.9%. So, that was up from 1.4% in Q2. So, we had mentioned that we would get ahead of this and our business teams did a great job of getting price in the quarter. Total inflation was about 1.2%. So, we had a positive spread there. And we were able to more than offset the increasing inflationary costs with increased pricing. And the results speak to the differentiated nature of our portfolio. So, in terms of the environment, I think with the tariffs and a little bit of inflation, it's becoming a bit easier to pass on pricing right now. And I think for the full year, we expect inflation to pick up a bit. We can see that in the channel building. So, we had 1.2% inflation in Q2 and Q1. We can see that picking up a bit in the balance of the year. But we think our pricing is going to remain strong and we'll maintain a positive spread for the full year.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got that. That's real helpful. And how serious are you looking at potential relocation of production? We've heard companies like Danaher call that out explicitly that that's part of their potential game plan. Is that stuff that you'll move forward on or is it just in terms of if things escalate?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: We have a very flexible manufacturing setup where we have in low-cost regions. So, there are certain product lines and by no means our entire portfolio, but certain product lines we're looking at relocating because we already have capability to manufacture in the region. So, we have manufacturing capability in a couple of regions, and we'll move it to a place that's not impacted by tariffs. But there are really a couple of select areas where we're looking at that and that will likely happen.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And if I just squeeze one more in please on oil and gas. How was that in the quarter? And then there was some news this week about additional pipeline investments coming, and would you be in a position to participate in that?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, great question, Deane. Our oil and gas business performed well in Q2. It was up mid-single digits. And we saw good strength in our upstream business that was up mid-teens. And our mid and downstream business that would be more tied to your pipelines and the downstream refinery, it was up low single digits. That was for the quarter. For the full year, we expect sales to be up mid to high single digits, where the upstream stays strong, but the mid and downstream get a little bit better as we progress through the year. And with $70 oil, we're seeing solid business activity. Our capital spending budgets are increasing. We are seeing a global pickup in activity. And there's been a lack of investments over the past few years. So, we're viewing the outlook on the oil and gas business over the next few years as very positive.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Good to hear. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Deane.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Couple of questions. First, if you look at just your incremental margins, ex-currency and acquisitions, what would they have been for the whole company, and then at the segment level, if you don't mind please?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay. For EIG, we had 26% operating margins. We were up 110 basis points, and excluding acquisitions, were 180 basis points, and the incrementals were about 50%. For EMG, the incrementals were around 20%. So, that includes the FX and M&A effect.
Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. And then...
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Up 35%.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, and overall for the total business, it was about 35%. Good point, Bill.
Matt J. Summerville - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. Thank you. And then just into your prepared remarks, Dave, maybe if you could dig in a little bit more into what you're seeing in your UPT business, what end markets are driving that strength, how much backlog visibility you have there? Maybe some more color on that. And then might as well go ahead and just do the runaround the various end markets as well please.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right, right. Sure. I mean UPT businesses is just a fantastic story. Bruce Wilson is the Vice President and General Manager of the division, and he was acquired in the first acquisition I did as the Group President. And we've acquired other niche technology businesses on the nanotechnology space. We're measuring very small things and we do it very well. And we acquired Zygo, we acquired Creaform, and their broad end markets where precision manufacturing and you want to measure things that are very small with nanometric measurements. So, it's in the optics market. There's a little bit of consumer market. There's precision manufacturing. So, it's a broad based. Military is broad based. They're firing on all cylinders with good new products. Creaform in particular is benefiting from a secular growth driver with their laser scanning 3D measurement. And this is just a well managed business and it's growing very nicely for us. I'll go around the horn, start with our process businesses, go around the businesses. Our process business had a great quarter with overall sales up mid-teens. This growth was driven by high single-digit organic sales growth and the contributions from the recent MOCON and SoundCom acquisitions. Organic growth remains broad based across our process businesses and reflects the strength of the niche leadership positions. We mentioned our UPT business. It did really well, growing low double digits in the quarter. Another business that grew low double digits was our Rauland business. Our Rauland-Borg business is doing really well. And for all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales for process to be up mid-single digits. Overall, aerospace sales were up mid-teens, driven by contributions from recently acquired FMH and mid-single-digit organic growth. We continue to see excellent commercial OEM and aftermarket growth as we have solid demand across our military business also. Our overall aerospace and defense businesses are well-positioned. They're balanced. Exposure across key market segments, commercial, business jets, military, aftermarket, and also diverse exposure across a wide range of legacy and next-generation platforms. So, we're feeling great about that business for all of 2018 and we continue to expect organic sales for our aerospace businesses to be up mid-single digits with growth across each market segment. Our overall sales for our power and industrial businesses were up 10% in the second quarter with mid-single-digit organic growth and the contributions from recent acquisitions. We saw broad-based growth across each of our power and industrial businesses, continued strong growth across our programmable power and VTI test and measurement businesses. For all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up mid-single digits. And finally, our automation and engineered solutions had another excellent quarter, solid organic growth, up 10% organically. The excellent orders growth that we experienced across these businesses in recent quarters is translating into a very strong organic growth. And demand remains solid in both our automation and engineered solutions businesses, and for all of 2018, we now expect high single-digit organic growth for our automated and engineered solutions businesses. So, we increased that to high single digits for organic growth for the year. That's around the company. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities: Hi, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities: Can we touch on the execution? Very strong in EIG. Is there anything to be mindful of in terms of mix? It sounds like UPT is still going very strong, and that would sort of diminish that at this point you seem to be thinking about?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I think EIG is just powering forward. I mean, it's a strong business. It's executing well. The orders ticked up a little bit sequentially. So, it's a positive outlook for the balance of the year. And our EMG business is executing well also. So, on the execution side, I'm feeling really good and our management teams are executing very well.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities: Perfect. And then just trying to reconcile the revenue outlook, it sounds like everything is going strong. You kept in the quarter somewhat of a range that you provide. Any reason sort of keeping that in? Is it just sort of conservatism as we enter the back half of the year and a lot of the uncertainty here?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, I think the mid-single-digit growth we had for the whole company organically in Q1, we got it mid-single, and we got it Q2 in mid-single. So, it doesn't pick up the fact that we move to the very high end of mid-single-digit. So, there was an increase in the guidance and that was driven largely by what happened in our automation and engineered solutions business and also what happened in the process side of our EIG business. So, it was guided toward the high end of mid-single-digit, but you don't see that. We're feeling really good at how the year is playing out. We have terrific momentum. Our margins are expanding. Pricing is running well ahead of inflation. We have solid plan to minimize the impact of our tariffs. And all that said, it's a bit prudent for the second half to be cautious with some of the trade-related matter. But to be clear, Allison, we're seeing strong underlying demand and we're confident in our outlook.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities: Great. Thanks so much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.

Operator: Brett Linzey, your line is now open.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hey, can you guys hear me okay?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, we can hear you, Brett.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah, okay. Yeah, so just back to the aerospace and defense. So, if we were to include FMH, how large from a revenue standpoint is that total business today? And then I guess separately if you just go platform-by-platform, what's in backlog, how much visibility do you have on those deliverables, whether it be months or years here in the coming quarters or so?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. Our total aerospace business is between $600 million and $700 million of revenue, and it has the best visibility in terms of backlog. That's the business we can look out. We have a lot of military business there and has firm backlog. Then you get into the process business, where there's a mix of – it's really mid-cycle. Our automated and engineered solutions is mid-cycle. So, it's a combination of mid-cycle and long cycle. And our aerospace and power businesses really give us the best visibility looking into the future.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then I guess just back to just M&A and some of the accretion from deals announced this year, I guess as you look at synergies and projections into next year, what sort of a net accretion rollover we should be thinking about in 2019 from some of these step deals you closed in 2018?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, well, in entering 2018, it was a net of about $0.06. And we haven't finished our planning for 2019, but it's going to be a similar kind of number for 2019 is the best estimate at this time. But we'll firm that up as we get closer to the end of the year and when we put out our guidance for 2019.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. And then just one last one on Motec. Any color you can give in terms of profitability price paid multiple? Any detail there?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, sure, sure. The profitability of the business is pretty profitable business, low 20%s EBITDA margins. It was about 2.5 times sales. It was about 11 times year one EBITDA.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. I'll pass it along. Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Brett.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hello, Bhupender.
Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey. Yeah, sitting in for Nigel here at Wolfe, and just had a question. I think it was asked earlier basically in the second half of your organic sales guidance. But, Dave, you did say there's some conservatism built in the second half with orders up like mid-single digits here. I don't know how going into July, you're kind of entering all this now, if you can talk about the trends you've seen, any slowdown from the traffic, tariff stuff, or anything on that sort?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No, it's a good question, Nigel (sic) [Bhupender] (40:11). We have not seen any demand impact from the – no demand impact [ph] that end (40:18). And we're almost through July, and July looks really strong in terms of orders. So, right in line with our plan and no slowdown at all. So, we're feeling really good about the orders and the outlook, and we haven't seen a demand impact at this point.
Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And looks like with the Motec, you have a new platform here. If you can just give us some sense of where do you want to grow in this particular machine vision robotics space here again (40:53)?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. We have a business in the U.S. called ISC, and it's a natural fit with ISC, and it's complementary and adjacent market. So, ISC has customers in the U.S. that Motec doesn't have and Motec has customers in Europe that ISC doesn't have. And the demand ramp that Motec's going through is very, very extreme, and AMETEK is well-positioned to help them do that. So, it's really a great business in a secular growth market, and as I said, the combination of the cameras for harsh environments, the video processing, and moving the video around a vehicle, or a transportation platform, and also the specific algorithms that let them improve processes and increase safety is really unique, and we're really optimistic about it.
Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, yeah. Again, Dave, I remember like when you acquired Rauland last year, you gave some market snapshot, the market growth in the health care business. Is there something kind of on a separate platform basis or is there a market size which you are looking at for Motec?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, right now, it is small enough that it will be with one of our existing businesses. But I could see this expanding into something bigger, and there's certainly more acquisitions that we're looking at in this space because we think it's a high growth space.
Bhupender Bohra - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay, got it. Cool. Thanks a lot.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Bhupender.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open.
Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey, guys, good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe. Just a quick question on military spending. I don't know if you're seeing any acceleration there as it pertains to the platforms, and I don't know if you can highlight anything on F-35 specifically? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, with military spending, as we had mentioned on some prior calls, Tristan, it's really picked up and we're on a lot of legacy platforms and we're on a lot of new platforms. And in fact the F-35 is the largest single platform that AMETEK has won to-date. So, we're very bullish on the F-35. So, we're seeing continuing spending there and looking forward to satisfying the customer demands. And it's also not just the U.S. Military, but we have a business in the UK that serves the international markets. So, we're seeing a strong growth there also. So, we're bullish on the military market. We have an outlook for mid-single-digit growth through this year. And it's still the largest part...
Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: It's the largest part of our Aerospace business. It's about 35% of it. So, it's substantial for us.
Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks. I'll join back the queue.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Danielle Lefland from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, hi. It's actually Andrew Obin for Dani. Hi, guys. How are you?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hello, Andrew. Good.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a question, a broader question. As you guys think about CapEx trends, we've had the tax reform, we've had the tariffs. When you talk to the customers, do you think people are more likely to spend on CapEx going into 2019, less likely? Do you think your customers would be thinking how they're going to spend CapEx in the U.S.? Just what are you seeing?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: We're seeing good global growth. I mean the U.S. market for us was the strongest of our geographies. It was up 9% in Q2. And clearly tax reform has an impact, but customers aren't talking to us about tax reform. They're just talking about meeting demand. And we also saw strong growth in China. China was up 14% for us in the quarter, and high single digits and great in all of Asia, and we had mid-single digits in Europe. So, we're not seeing any impact on the demand side, and most of the customers in the U.S. are benefiting from tax reform. And I think there are – with all the tariff discussions, I think most people are monitoring those, but it's not stopping them from going forward with business activity because the demand environment is so strong.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got you. So, if you were to guess what inning we are in terms of, sort of, CapEx cycle, once again talking to your customers, what would you guys guess?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, I would guess – my feeling is we went through an industrial recession in 2015 and 2016, and we're coming out of that and I think we're in the fourth inning.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got you. Yeah, sorry. Just a follow-up question. I think Fortive announced a series of deals, sort of, shifting their model sounds like on the margin more toward Roper has been doing. How do you guys think about sort of adding software longer-term to your portfolio? And I apologize if the question has been asked. I've been a little bit late.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Could you repeat the question, Andrew, the last part.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just the question, Fortive has announced software as a service acquisition, following another software as a service acquisition. It seems more industrial as sort of doing software deals. How do you guys think about software acquisitions going forward?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, I mean software is an important part of AMETEK's portfolio. A lot of our EIG businesses are niche leaders and softwares are critical components. So, we're certainly exploring opportunities and the business that we announced today, Motec, the software is critical to that business. Our Rauland-Borg business that we purchased in Q1 of 2017, that business has a burgeoning enterprise software business. So, software is important to us and we are looking at the businesses that could help our existing businesses in that area.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Terrific. Thanks a lot.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew.

David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an outstanding first quarter. We generated record levels of sales and orders backed by strong broad-based organic growth and significant contributions from recent acquisitions. We delivered tremendous operating performance, resulting in record-level operating income, impressive margin expansion, strong cash flow generation, and robust earnings per share growth. We announced our second acquisition of 2018 this morning, continuing to successfully deploy capital on strategic acquisitions. And lastly, given our strong first quarter results and the positive backlog and order momentum, we've raised our full year 2018 sales and earning guidance; so overall an excellent high-quality quarter. Now onto the financial highlights of the quarter. Total sales in the first quarter were a record $1.17 billion, up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Organic sales growth was exceptional, up 8% in the quarter. Recent acquisitions added 5% and foreign currency was a 3% benefit. We continued to see broad-based organic growth across each of our businesses and key geographies. Our businesses are capitalizing on their leading niche positions in attractive markets, while also benefiting from our initiatives to improve organic growth. We also continue to see sustained and robust orders growth. Overall orders were excellent, up 20% in the quarter, with organic orders up 12%. As a result, we ended the year with a record backlog of $1.6 billion, providing us with excellent visibility. Operating income was a record at $258.2 million in the first quarter, up 19% compared to the first quarter in 2017. Reported operating income margins were 22%, up 40 basis points over last year's first quarter. On a core basis, operating margins were a very strong 80 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the outstanding operating leverage we generate from strong organic sales growth. Diluted earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, up an impressive 30% compared to the $0.60 per share reported in the same quarter of 2017. Now, turning to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group; our EIG businesses are performing exceptionally well across our key market segments. First quarter sales for EIG were $716.4 million, up 16% versus the prior year. Organic sales were strong, up 6% and the acquisitions of Rauland, MOCON and Arizona Instrument contributed another 6%. Foreign currency was a 3-point tailwind for the quarter. While organic growth was broad based, we saw particular strength in our Process & Analytical Instruments and Ultra Precision Technologies divisions during the quarter. EIG's first quarter operating income was $183.4 million, up 18% over the first quarter of 2017. And reported operating income margins increased 50 basis points to 25.6%. On a core basis, EIG margins were up 90 basis points over the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also had a fantastic quarter. EMG sales for the quarter were a record $456.2 million, up 18% over the same quarter in 2017. Organic sales increased an impressive 11% with continued broad-based strength across our automation, engineered materials and thermal management systems businesses. Recently acquired FMH Aerospace contributed an additional 2% and foreign currency provided a 4-point tailwind. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $91 million, an increase of 16% compared to the same quarter in 2017. Reported operating margins for the quarter were strong at 19.9% with core margins up 30 basis points versus the first quarter of 2017. To summarize, first quarter results were superb. Our colleagues continued to drive incredible performance for AMETEK's operating model and the execution of our four growth strategies. We remain focused on investing in our businesses and our people to best position us for sustained long-term success. Before I discuss our updated outlook for 2018, let me highlight some of the achievements we have experienced from our growth strategies. First, acquisitions; we're off to a great start in 2018 with two acquisitions completed so far. In January, we completed the acquisition of FMH Aerospace, a leading provider of highly-engineered and differentiated components for use in the aerospace, defense and space markets. We are very excited about the acquisition of FMH as it expands our solution offerings across a wide range of attractive aerospace and defense platforms. We are also very excited to announce the acquisition of SoundCom Corporation (sic) [SoundCom Systems] and we welcome the team to AMETEK. SoundCom, which is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, designs, integrates and services clinical workflow and communication systems for end users in the healthcare, government and educational markets. SoundCom also serves as a value-added reseller for our recently acquired Rauland business in Ohio and Michigan, joining existing value-added resellers Rauland currently owns in Florida and California. Rauland, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2017, is a leading global provider of mission-critical clinical communication systems and workflow solutions to hospitals, healthcare systems and educational facilities. Rauland was the foundation of a new strategic growth platform in the attractive healthcare solutions market. It was an attractive acquisition for AMETEK, given the strong growth dynamics across the healthcare markets it serves as well as the opportunity to expand the Rauland platform through acquisitions. SoundCom is an excellent addition to this platform as it expands Rauland's value-added reseller footprint into high-density healthcare and educational markets in Ohio and Michigan. Value-added resellers such as SoundCom are key in the delivery and service of complex electronic workflow and communications systems developed by Rauland. SoundCom has annual sales of approximately $40 million. With the acquisition of SoundCom, we have now deployed approximately $275 million on two acquisitions thus far in 2018 and since the beginning of 2017, we had deployed approximately $835 million on five acquisitions. Acquisitions remain the top priority for deployment of our free cash flow. Our deal pipeline remains very healthy and AMETEK's tremendous cash flow generation and balance sheet strength, plus the additional flexibility provided by tax reform, we are very well positioned to strategically pursue attractive acquisition candidates. We also remain well positioned to invest in organic growth through new products and solutions, front-end sales and service optimization, and production efficiencies. Our businesses continue to unveil new products and solutions that are solving our customers' greatest challenges. For example, our Zygo business, part of AMETEK's Ultra Precision Technologies division, launched two next-generation 3D optical profilers during the first quarter. The Nexview NX2 and NewView 9000 3D optical profiling instruments provide highly precise non-contact measurement of a surface area across a wide range of markets and applications, including consumer electronics, automotive, semiconductor, medical, nanotechnology and materials science. These latest offerings provide significant improvements in both performance and functionality, enabling non-destructive and precise 3D measurement, including step heights, roughness, film thickness, and surface form on a broad range of sample types. New products such as these are key drivers to sustained organic growth and the long-term success of AMETEK. One way we measure the success of our new product development efforts is through our vitality index which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years. In the first quarter, our vitality index was excellent at 25%, reflecting the excellent work of our research, development and engineering teams. In 2018, we expect to increase our RD&E investment by 6% year-over-year to approximately $235 million. Additionally, our businesses continued to drive impressive productivity improvements and cost reduction through our operational excellence initiatives. In 2018, we anticipate OpEx savings of approximately $85 million, with a majority of these savings being generated by global sourcing and strategic procurement activities. Our global sourcing team also does an excellent job helping us manage potential inflationary impacts across our supply chain and through the identification and qualification of alternative sources of supply and through active management of our supplier base. We are closely monitoring these potential inflationary factors and are comfortable we will be able to more than offset inflation with price increases in 2018. Finally, we are seeing significant expansion into adjacent markets around the globe. International sales were 52% of AMETEK's total sales, with strong organic growth across all key geographical regions. Specifically, we saw excellent broad-based organic growth in Asia as our businesses continued to expand their presence in attractive growth regions. With that said, let me touch on our updated outlook for 2018. For the full year, we now anticipate overall sales to be up low-double digits, with organic sales up mid-single digits. Earnings per share for 2018 are now expected to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.12, up 17% to 20% from 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.61. This is an increase from our initial guidance range of $2.95 to $3.05. For the second quarter, overall sales are projected to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid-single digits compared to the second quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share in the second quarter are expected to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.78, up 17% to 20% compared to the second quarter of 2017. In summary, AMETEK started off the year with outstanding performance. Our world-class teams and their businesses have positioned the company for another record year. AMETEK's foundation is strong and we are focused on delivering long-term success through the execution of our four growth strategies. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK started the year with an outstanding quarter, generating record results and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights. In the first quarter, core selling expenses were up in line with core sales growth. General, administrative expenses in the first quarter were flat compared to 2017 and as a percentage of sales were 1.4% down from last year's first quarter level of 1.6% of sales. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.1% versus last year's rate of 27.4% and in line with our expectations. The year-over-year reduction in our effective tax rate was due to the benefits of tax reform. We continue to estimate our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 23% and as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. Working capital was excellent at 16.8% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting the outstanding performance of our businesses. Capital expenditures were $12 million for the quarter and we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $85 million or 1.8% of sales. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $49 million and for the full year, we expect D&A to be approximately $200 million. First quarter operating cash flow was $177 million, up 25% compared to the first quarter of 2017, and free cash flow in the quarter was $165 million, up 28% over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 91% in the quarter, slightly better than our expectations and we continue to expect excellent full year free cash flow conversion of 120% of net income. As Dave mentioned, we've been very active on the acquisition front, deploying approximately $275 million on the acquisitions of FMH Aerospace and SoundCom thus far in 2018. Total debt at March 31 was $2.21 billion, up from $2.17 billion at the end of 2017. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $557 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at March 31 of 28.2%. Following the acquisitions of FMH Aerospace and SoundCom, we have more than $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the first quarter, delivering record-level results and a high quality of earnings. We remain well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great, thank you, Bill. Victor, can we please open the call up for questions?
Operator: Yes, sir. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, all.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. I wanted to – I know you said, Dave, that you expect price/cost to be positive on a full-year basis. Could you maybe be specific with us for at least the quarter, sort of what price was versus what inflation was?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure, Scott. In Q1, we achieved price of about 1.4% and total inflation was about 1.2%. We were able to more than offset inflationary cost with increased pricing and I think the results speak to the differentiated nature of our product portfolio and our leadership position in our niche markets and our outstanding supply chain capability, and we expect that to continue for the year and we'll be able to offset inflation with price.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got you. However, those numbers should both drift up a little bit after what we saw with commodities inflation in the first quarter?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, I think you could see them both going up through the course of the year.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Also, could you sort of do your typical by division synopsis of what's happening and what you expect? Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure, Scott. I'll start with the process business. Our process businesses had an outstanding start to the year. Overall sales were up 20%. High-single-digit organic growth and contributions from the Rauland and MOCON acquisitions were the key drivers. Continuing the trend from last year, we saw strong broad-based organic growth in the quarter with particularly solid growth across our Zygo, Creaform, TMC, Precitech and Energy & Process Instrumentation businesses. And for all of 2018, we continue to expect broad-based strength with our organic sales up mid-single digits. Overall aerospace sales were up low-teens in the quarter, driven by contributions from recently acquired FMH and mid-single-digit organic growth. Growth remained strong across our military businesses as we are seeing solid demand both in the U.S. and internationally, and we're also seeing continued solid growth across our commercial aerospace and aftermarket businesses. They had a very good quarter. For all of 2018, we continue to expect organic sales growth for aerospace businesses to be up mid-single digits with solid growth across each market segment. Our power and industrial businesses saw strong growth in the first quarter with overall sales up 10%, driven by mid-single-digit organic growth and contributions from recently acquired Arizona Instrument. Growth was solid in both our power and industrial segments with notable strength across our power test and measurement business, including programmable power and VTI. And for 2018, we now expect power and industrial organic sales to be up mid-single digits. And finally, our automated (sic) [automation] and engineered solutions business had an excellent start to the year, with low-double-digit organic sales growth in the first quarter. We continued to see strong sales and order strengths across both our automation businesses and our engineered solutions business. In 2018, we now expect mid to high-single-digit organic sales growth for all of our automated (sic) [automation] and engineered solutions businesses. That's around the horn, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got you. Thank you very much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. You may begin.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, Dave. So, SoundCom's kind of interesting. It sounds like a little more of a services business than we're used to. So, just curious how much of that is tied to Rauland and maybe a little deeper dive on how you view the bolt-on runway in the communication systems arena.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right, right. SoundCom is a value-added reseller for Rauland and they actually represent about 5% of Rauland's sales, and they're in high-density healthcare markets of Ohio and Michigan. And Rauland – the VARs are very important to the Rauland model. So, they've had a long-term business relationship and Rauland has VARs in some regions that they own. I mentioned Florida and California, and this was a natural logical adjacency. So, they have customers that include large healthcare systems like the Cleveland Clinic, Mercy Health, educational facilities like Ohio State, Michigan State, and they're really key to Rauland because they provide the deep technical expertise in designing and integrating the advanced solutions that Rauland delivers. They have integrated solutions that move Rauland closer to the end customer. So, it positions really the value-added resellers, Rauland is a natural acquirer for those type of companies in high-density population areas and they also make Rauland a natural acquirer for attractive adjacent markets, because the VARs also represent those products. So, we see that as a very attractive way for Rauland to expand because Rauland has their own VARs, they have optimized the processes, so there's a lot of synergies in these regional VARs. And then in addition to that, it provides closer customer contact and growth opportunities. This particular business has grown low-double digits average compounded annually over the last five years. So, it's a very good grower. Low-double-digit EBITDAs and it's a nice opportunity for Rauland to expand their footprint and get closer to the customers. In less dense parts of the country, parts of the world, value-added resellers still make sense, but in some places it makes sense for Rauland to get closer to the customer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. And then on the organic 8%, it's very good obviously. I'm just wondering how you're measuring and gauging your progress on channel and new product introduction, execution into the addressable markets versus what's the cyclical lift here?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, with 8% organic growth and 12% organic growth in orders, we're certainly seeing some tangible success from our organic growth initiatives. Our focus on improving the front end of our business and continuing success from new product development efforts is driving market share gains. We've talked before about our growth kaizens and we're seeing very tangible benefits from specific actions and we're very optimistic with this effort and there's more to come. But also the general economic improvements is certainly a key driver, and it's really difficult to distinguish between the two. But what I can say, we see no slowdown at all in the way we're looking at the world right now. We see strong growth across all of our product groups. We're growing in all geographies and we're feeling really good.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Sounds good. Thanks for the color.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. You may begin.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Rob.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Congrats on a very strong start to the year. Maybe we could talk about price on two spectra. One is just pricing overall over the next couple years because you're a firm that definitely just the nature of your business, the market structure, the value add should be garnering a pretty nice price benefit and particularly in the context of a price spread. So, would you expect price/cost to be positive going forward for the full year and how should we think about just conceptually into 2019 because you're a company that historically, I think, has – part of your incremental margin lift has come from kind of structurally strong pricing. Could you talk about that a little bit?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. Great question, Rob. We expect to maintain a positive price inflation spread for the whole year, and we're talking about price inflation, we're just talking about inflation, we're not talking about productivity. That's just a pure total inflation number. And with our differentiated businesses and our closeness to the customer, we have a wide moat around our businesses. We can pass on the increased cost for inflation. So, we really expect a positive price inflation spread in the 20 to 30 bps range and we expect to hold that this year and there's no reason that that won't continue into 2019.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And then maybe switching to price in terms on the acquisition front because clearly you've deployed some capital nicely. We would like to see probably more size and scale, but you can't have everything. But could you just talk about the state of your balance sheet, your firepower? And maybe just comment on – it's an interesting environment because you've probably seen a pullback in the public environment, but sellers' expectations still probably remain elevated here. Do you think you could reach kind of a bid/ask issue in terms of people thinking of their companies as still very dear and being able to transact is going to be tough, or do you think you could shake some pretty big deals this year?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Those are all great questions, Rob. I mean the current M&A environment is very similar to what we've been experiencing the past couple of years. Pricing is elevated. There is plenty of cash-chasing deals. Now with the public market coming back again, that will eventually flow into the private market, but despite this market we've been successful in deploying our free cash flow on acquisitions. I mean, since the – I mentioned in my prepared remarks, since the beginning of 2017 we acquired five companies and deployed nearly $835 million in capital and we're off to a great start in 2018. And our pipeline remains very active. You never know if something is going to transact in the short term, but I expect you'll be hearing from us again this year on M&A. Our strong pipeline along with the M&A processes gives me confidence. And mentioned the larger deals or the size deals that we've been doing, we're going to execute our – we can do either one to execute our strategy. We've opened up our pipeline to slightly larger deals in the $200 million to $300 million revenue range, there will be deployments of capital of $1 billion, but we can keep doing the smaller deals and we can still get the earnings growth because of the way we structured the business and our acquisition process. So, I'm feeling really good about it. And you mentioned finally our firepower, I think Bill mentioned our existing cash and credit facility was about – we have about $1.5 billion in firepower and most importantly, we'll generate another $865 million, $870 million in free cash flow in 2018. So, we really have the firepower. Our net debt-to-EBITDA is about 1.35. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA is 1.85. So, we could deploy 2-plus billion in capital this year, and really the strategy is not capital limited, it's finding those key acquisitions that we can add value to, so we can maintain a return on invested capital of 10% in year three. That's the key hurdle for us. That gives you the return on total capital for the whole business, and AMETEK has extremely strong return on total capital for an acquisitive company, and we maintain that discipline and that discipline is the limiter right now. But we are clearly looking at things and our pipeline's full, and we'll be clear to select the deals that we can make the most – that we can approve the most, but I think the – I'm very optimistic about what I see in our pipeline right now.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: If I could sneak one more in, just amortization, any update on looking on that and studying that, whether you want to make a move to cash earnings.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Our EBITDA was a record $306 million this quarter. It's 26% of sales, so a very good number. Our D&A was about $49 million, and as I said in our last call, that we looked at that at the beginning of the year and we decided not to do it. And we'll look at it again next year. But that's the decision we made for 2018.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi guys, good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Allison.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, could you talk a little bit about conversations with customers broadly across the group. I know you said the outlook's pretty strong, but are there any areas where customers are maybe becoming more cautious or even maybe accelerating the orders ahead of the likely price increases? Any thoughts there.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: It's pretty much bullish across our whole portfolio. We were in Asia this quarter, the executive office went for our annual regional review in Asia, and that region was incredibly bullish, and we're seeing strength in the U.S., continuing strength in Europe, and all of our product groups are very positive. We're even seeing some of the longer cycle elements of our portfolio, like the mid and downstream oil and gas, the military parts of our business, they're very bullish about bigger projects breaking later in the year and into 2019. So, our automation businesses are firing on all cylinders. So, we're not seeing any slowdown and we feel really good about the year. We feel really good about how the year's playing out.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. And then just not to beat the sort of price inflation issue up a little bit, but are there any specific businesses, could you remind us, that are maybe more susceptible to the inflation and your thoughts on passing that through in terms of pricing?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, I think we've had a strategy for a long period of time to acquire businesses that are really leaders in niche markets and that puts us in a position – we're providing more value, these are markets that are sticky customer relationships. And we're providing a lot of value to these customers and we get in situations like this, we view it as only fair that we can pass those prices on to customers. So, we feel really good about our portfolio and we feel really good about achieving price out of inflation in 2018 and 2019.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great, thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. Like to follow that train of thought on customer dialogue and do you have any color on whether tax reform and CapEx incentives are playing through in any of the demand that you're seeing.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Deane, we were seeing it. We saw an uptick in our business in 2017 in the second half and that was pretty measurable. But into 2018, we have not seen an incremental increase from tax reform. It's just remained strong. So, I can't say that we've seen an increase specifically tied to tax reform and with specific customers with regard to tax reform. It's just really good and it's staying that way.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then just other color on the price/cost dynamic. You didn't mention tariffs, do you feel as though that's any impact including what could be on the horizon here?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, it's a great question, Deane. We do not import much steel and aluminum, so really a minimal impact from that. We are watching the entire situation closely as you can imagine, including secondary impacts. We have very good supply chain capability and flexibility and we're doing some planning on the supply chain side, if we need to react quickly. And the same point that goes to pricing, we're leaders in niche markets and we have sticky customer relationships and have the ability to pass on cost increases to customers. So, we're examining numerous countermeasures, just something be enacted. Right now we don't see a measurable impact to our business, but it's uncertain and we're closely monitoring it.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And just last question for me, can you – and were there any growth investments in the quarter that you would highlight along either digital marketing or sales force investments, anything along those lines?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, it's all the above. We're investing about $75 million this year in growth investments and heavy investments in digital marketing, heavy investments in a lot of selling tools and also heavy investments in product development. So, we're feeling really good about the investments. We think we're getting a great return and we're optimistic about that in the future.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Do you have a sense of how much in this quarter and would that be spread across the segments? Is there any of that in corporate?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Most of that is in the segments and it's spread out through the year.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey from Vertical Research. You may begin.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi, good morning, all.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hey, just wanted to come back to EMG and specifically on incremental margins. Given strong volume, I would have thought incrementals would have been a little bit better in quarter and I realize FX dropped – the drop-through there (36:28) incrementals, but anything else in terms of mix or excess cost, I mean deliveries, price/cost that impacted you here in the quarter within EMG?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Brett, EMG had a great quarter. I mean, sequentially, the margins were up 170 basis points and on a core basis, they were up 30 bps. So, we're pretty pleased with the performance.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And I guess how should we think about incremental margins within EMG for the balance of the year?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, I think we've guided to the incrementals in the low-30s, 35% and I think in general, the Instruments side of our business has little bit higher incrementals, so I would say in the 35% to 40% range, and EMG is a little bit lower in the 25% to 30% range.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. And then just shifting back to your comment on long cycle, I guess in the context of visibility, obviously you've been deploying a lot on deals here. If you were look at the pro forma construct of the portfolio, including some of these recent deals, how would you size what you would characterize as longer cycle (37:52) a percent of the total portfolio today?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I would characterize the bulk of the portfolio in mid and longer cycle businesses. We don't have many short cycle businesses, but the vast majority of the portfolio is in mid and longer cycle businesses.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then maybe just one more, in terms of recent acquisitions, so FMH, Arizona, SoundCom, how are we thinking about incremental earnings accretion as we look into 2019 and some of the (38:30) starts to abate? Any framework you can list there?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, we haven't done the work for 2019 yet, but I can tell you that in our plan for 2018, we saw a net benefit of M&A of about $0.06.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. Great quarter, guys. Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Brett.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. You may begin.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Richard.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Could you just speak for a minute, Dave, perhaps to the order strength? I think you've mentioned core orders were plus 12%. Could you just talk to maybe a couple end markets that might be driving order growth above that kind of average core number? And I'm thinking specifically to some of the more cyclical, maybe speak to oil and gas.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And then also on the aerospace side, I mean, are you seeing outsized order growth there, maybe regional biz jet? Or maybe just a little color around the 12% number.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. I mean, regarding oil and gas, in the first quarter, our sales were up low-double digits and orders outpaced that a bit. And in terms of the aerospace business, we saw very strong performance in our commercial business. So, it was up low-double digits in the first quarter, both OE and aftermarket. And also the military business stands out. There was a very strong orders performance in military, and our automation business stands out. There was very strong orders in automation and across all regions of the globe, so it was a really good quarter from the viewpoint of orders.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Does your oil and gas – given how the first quarter started out, I think there was an expectation for oil and gas to be up kind of mid-single digits this year, kind of led by, I think it was upstream. Does that number drift higher now with your comments around downstream orders, and also maybe how the first quarter shook out?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, the first quarter performance, our upstream business was up, the upstream is only 25% of our oil and gas presence, and that's about a $280 million exposure. But it was up very strongly. It was up about 30% in the first quarter and the mid/downstream was up in the mid high-single-digit range. So, we haven't changed the year guidance yet for that. It's still mid-single digits for the year, but what we're seeing now is the planning work for some orders in the second half of the year that'll ship in 2019 for the bigger projects in the mid and downstream markets.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Understood. And then just the last question, around the acquisition SoundCom, I'm a little bit curious, is the service element of Rauland-Borg's business – does the service element flow through the VARs? In other words, there's a big service component to SoundCom Systems, and hence the advantage of owning a few of the VARs in key markets, does that bring the recurring revenue stream to Rauland?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: It does bring some. I mean, the recurring revenue stream is from spare parts, from software upgrades, and also from the direct service of the client. So, the acquisitions of the VARs does augment the recurring revenue business for Rauland.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Understood. Thank you. And great start to the year.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. You may begin.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Hey, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Curious on components for your parts, you're not really seeing it in the inventory levels you have on your balance sheet, but are you seeing a little tightness in that market and there's been some commentary about people trying to buy ahead of that and kind of keep some safety stock and increase the levels of that. Are you seeing that in the market or are you doing some of that yourself?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: We're not doing much of it, but there is some tightness. We're seeing some tightness in the electronic supply chain and we're also seeing some increased inflationary cost in the transportation that we talked about last quarter, but there is some tightness out there, but we're managing through it and we have excellent supply chain capability, but there is some tightness.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then your businesses exposed on the specialty metals side, have they been tracking pretty closely with price movements in those markets? And is that kind of a consistent – something that's been progressing throughout the quarter and like kind of at high run rates right now versus maybe the beginning of the quarter?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. That business, you recall the way we have that business structured is we pass the material prices on to the customer. And we're adding value to the materials. But it is progressing and that business is doing very well.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I'm actually showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Kevin Coleman. Please go ahead, sir.
Kevin Coleman: Great, thank you, Andrew. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us for AMETEK's fourth quarter earnings conference call.

As such, these statements are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We will begin with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill and then we’ll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. AMETEK had a great year. Capped off by an exceptional fourth quarter in which we exceeded our expectations and established records for essentially all key financial metrics. In the fourth quarter, we generated a record level of sales with a robust and broad-based organic sales growth. We also generated a record level of orders providing us with solid visibility as we enter 2018. We delivered excellent operating performance with a strong core margin expansion, a high quality of earnings and record diluted earnings per share. We generated a record level of cash flow, while continue to deploy those cash flow on a strategic acquisitions having just announced two new acquisitions simply put the AMETEK model is working. As we look ahead, we remain confident on our ability to deliver strong performance in 2018. I’ll provide more details on our 2018 guidance in a moment, but first let me provide the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year results. Our fourth quarter reported results included an after-tax gain of $75.5 million as the gain from the remeasurement of our tax deferred liabilities due to Tax Reform was offset in part by a change related to the repatriation of our unremitted foreign earnings and certain other items in the quarter including realignment costs and a charitable note donation to the AMETEK Foundation. The AMETEK Foundation is the charitable honor of AMETEK. It focuses its support on early childhood education, health and welfare and social programs in the communities where AMETEK has a presence. As a result of Tax Reform, we made a $5 million donation to our charitable foundation in the fourth quarter. I’ll comment further on Tax Reform and the impact on AMETEK in a moment. Please note that any references made on this call to 2016 or 2017 financial results will be on an adjusted basis excluding the fourth quarter of 2017 items noted above and the fourth quarter of 2016 realignment cost. AMETEK’s fourth quarter sales were a record $1.14 billion, up 17%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Organic sales were excellent up 9% in the quarter with acquisitions adding 6% and foreign currency providing a 2% benefit to sales. Organic sales growth remains broad based across each of our businesses in key geographies. It reflects the continuation of the global synchronized growth I spoke to last quarter combined with the strength of our businesses in our niche positions across attractive growth markets. We're also very pleased with the strength and orders as fourth quarter orders continue excellent pace of growth we experienced in the first three quarters of the year. Overall, orders were up 19% in the fourth quarter with organic orders up 9%. This level of orders growth enabled us to end 2017 with a record backlog of $1.4 billion. Operating income in the quarter was a record $251.4 million, up 18% over the same period in 2016. Operating income margins were 22%, up 10 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the dilutive impact on margins from recent acquisitions, operating income margins in the quarter were 22.4%, up 50 basis points compared to last year’s fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share were a record at $0.70 in the quarter, representing an impressive 21% increase compared to the $0.58 reported in the same quarter of last year. AMETEK’s businesses continue to operate at a very high level, generating tremendous cash flow. Operating cash flow was a record $253 million in the fourth quarter and free cash flow conversion was an excellent 137% of adjusted net income. Now for the full year of 2017. AMETEK established records across all key financial measures. Sales were a record $4.3 billion up 12% over 2016 and organic sales were up 6%. Full year orders were also excellent about 18% overall and 10% organically with broad-based strength across our businesses. Operating income was $936.9 million, up 11% over last year while operating margins were 21.8% for the full year. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions on margins, full year operating margins were up 22.2%, up 30 basis points over 2016. Full year 2017 diluted earnings per share for a record $2.61, up 13% compared to $2.30 in 2016. Lastly, our cash flow generation for the full year was exceptional with operating cash flow up 17% to a record $883.3, excluding a $50 million pension contribution in the first quarter of 2017. Now turning to the individual operating groups, first the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG sales in the fourth quarter increased 20% versus the prior year to a record $741.5 million. Organic sales were strong, up 9% in the quarter. The acquisitions of Rauland and MOCON contributed 10% and foreign currency was a two point tailwind. EIG’s operating income in the quarter was a record $195.6 million, up 20% over the prior year, and operating incomes were very strong at 26.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, EIG margins were a superb 27.5%, up 110 basis points over the last year. The Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter. EMG’s sales were up 13% year-over-year to $401.6 million. Organic sales growth was broad based, up 10% over last year. The acquisition of Laserage contributed 1% and foreign currency contributed 2%. EMG’s operating income in the quarter was $74.2 million, up 18% over the same period in 2016. Fourth quarter operating margins were 18.5%, up 80 basis points over last year. In summary, AMETEK results in the fourth quarter and for the full year were outstanding. I want to extend my thanks to all AMETEK colleagues for their excellent work and congratulate them on the great successes in 2017. While we benefited from the strong global macro environment, our team continues to execute each of AMETEK’s growth strategies and deliver excellent performance in the short-term while positioning their businesses well for long-term success. Before I discuss our outlook for 2018, I want to touch on some of these averages, which are powering AMETEK success. First, acquisitions. We remain very active on the acquisition front having just announced the acquisitions of two businesses: FMH Aerospace and Arizona Instrument. FMH Aerospace, which we acquired in January, is a leading provider of highly engineered and differentiated components for use in the aerospace, defense and space markets. Their products are used to facilitate the transfer of fluids and gases, extreme temperatures and pressures with highly demanding mission critical applications. FMH is currently supporting more than 100 strategic platforms with applications that include aircraft fuel systems, auxiliary power units and cabin pressurization. FMH is an excellent addition to our thermal management systems division as it brings strong positions across a range of attractive aerospace and defense platforms while providing us with highly complimentary products and solutions. FMH is based in Irvine, California and has annual sales of approximately $50 million. We deployed approximately $235 million on the acquisition. Arizona Instrument, which we acquired in late December, develops a manufacture of high quality precision instrumentation measurements for high value applications. There are advanced moisture and toxic gas analysis instrumentation, serves several markets with attractive growth dynamics including food, pharmaceuticals and environmental. Arizona has an attractive mix of aftermarket sales at approximately 40%. Arizona Instrument decisively complements our Brookfield viscosity measurement business, which we acquired in 2016 allowing us to further expand AMETEK’s product offering in these attractive secular growth markets. Arizona Instruments is based in Chandler, Arizona and has annual sales of approximately $15 million. We deployed approximately $38 million on the acquisition. Over the last twelve months, we have acquired four businesses, deployed nearly $800 million in capital and acquired approximately $290 million in sales revenue, essentially achieving our stated strategy of deploying our free cash flow on acquisitions. Our business and M&A teams remain very active and are managing a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. Given our excellent cash flow generation, the strength of our balance sheet and now more flexibility with respect to our foreign cash due to Tax Reform, we have significant financial capacity available to deploy on strategic acquisitions. We're also seeing great results from our new product development strategy. New products are an interval component of our long-term success. Through our investments in new products and technologies, our businesses are helping their customers to solve their most complex challenges. Our teams were very active and successful in 2017 introducing many outstanding new products. Our vitality index, which measures the level of sales generated from new products and solutions, introduced within the last three years continues to reflect the great success from our work. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index was a very strong 24%. AMETEK also continues to invest meaningfully in our research and development and engineering. In 2017, we invested approximately $221 million in RD&E, up 10% from 2016. And in 2018, we expect to increase our investments to approximately $235 million, up 6% over 2017. Lastly, our business has continued to deliver outstanding performance from our operational excellence initiatives. In 2017 along with excellent working capital management, we realized more than $100 million in savings with most of these savings coming from our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives.  In 2018, we expect to achieve approximately $85 million in savings from our operational excellence initiatives with the majority being driven through our sourcing and procurement activities. In addition to the strong success of our OpEx tools focused on productivity improvements, we're seeing positive results from the expansion of our operational excellent tools focused on the front-end or customer-facing part of our business. We are very pleased with the success we have seen and expect this success will continue to contribute to our organic growth. I want to take a moment to comment on Tax Reform and AMETEK’s capital deployment strategy. Not surprisingly Tax Reform is a positive for AMETEK. We will see a lower effective tax rate. We have better and more efficient access to our foreign cash, which will provide us with additional flexibility. And although not a large direct benefit to us given our asset like business model, it is likely it will benefit our customers that will consider accelerated capital expenditures given the full expensing of certain capital investments. However the benefits of Tax Reform do not change AMETEK’s fundamental approach to investment and capital allocation. We will continue to invest appropriately back into our businesses to support the growth initiatives. Following these internal investments, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as does our stated objective of deploying our free cash flow on acquisitions. We will continue to make opportunistic share repurchases and we will continue to be able pay a modest dividend as we have done in the past. With respect to the dividend, we announced today that our Board of Directors approved a 56% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting the strength and confidence we have in our underlying cash flows. This increase brings our regularly quarter rate to $0.14 per share from our indicated annual rate to $0.56 per share. We have last raised our dividend in 2014 and this raise increases our dividend yield to the desire range of between 0.5% and 1%. Now let me turn to the outlook for 2018. For the full year, we anticipate overall sales will be up 7% to 9% compared to 2017. Organic sales are expected to be up 3% to 5% with similar levels of organic growth expected across each of our reportable segments. 2018 earnings per diluted share expected to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.05 reflecting a 13% to 17% increase compared to 2017’s adjusted earnings of $2.61 per diluted share. The guidance range reflects the expected tax benefit from Tax Reform and assumes an approximate 23% effective rate in 2018 versus our 26% effective rate in 2017. In the first quarter, sales are projected to be up low double-digits compared to the first quarter of 2017 with organic sales up mid single-digits. First quarter diluted earnings per share are anticipated to fall within the range of $0.70 to $0.72, up 17% to 20%, compared to the first quarter of last year. To summarize, AMETEK finished an outstanding year with an exceptionally strong quarter. Our businesses and the world-class teams are well positioned for another year of growth and sustainable long-term success. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year. And then we will glad to take your questions. Bill?
Bill Burke: Thank you, Dave. As Dave has noted, AMETEK had an excellent quarter. We delivered a record level of performance with a very high quality of earnings. I will provide some additional color on our financial highlights. We will also provide more details on the impact of Tax Reform on AMETEK and our reported results. First let me touch on Tax Reform. As a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, AMETEK recognized a gain of $185.8 million, or $0.80 per share, in the fourth quarter. This one-time non-cash gain was a result of the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities. Also as a result of Tax Reform, we incurred a $94.2 million, or $0.41 per share charge in the fourth quarter related to repatriation and associated withholding taxes. The net impact of these tax adjustments resulted in a gain in the fourth quarter of $91.6 million, or $0.39 per share. This gain should be considered provisional and maybe subject to further adjustment during the measurement period. This gain was offset in part by certain other items in the quarter. First, we took a pre-tax realignment charge of $16.8 million or $0.05 per share. This charge will allow us to better position our long-term cost structure and includes cost associated with the final stages of the consolidation of our floor care and specialty motors business with our precision motion control business. And second, we made a pre-tax $5 million, or $0.01 per share, charitable donation to the AMETEK Foundation in the fourth quarter due to the benefits from Tax Reform. Combined these other items totaled $21.8 million pre-tax, $16.1 million after-tax or $0.06 per share So as a result of Tax Reform and these other items, the reported gain included in our fourth quarter GAAP earnings was $75.5 million or $0.33 per share. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, core selling expenses were up in line with core sales growth. General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were up over the prior year due largely to higher compensation expense. The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 25.7% versus last year’s rate of 27.1% and was in line with our expectation. We are still evaluating the impact of Tax Reform on our go forward effective tax rate, however, based on current information available we have estimated our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 23% given our expected benefits from Tax Reform. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was excellent at 16.8% of sales in the fourth quarter, down from 18.4% in the same period of 2016 reflecting the great performance of our businesses. Capital expenditures were $29 million in the quarter and $75 million for the full year. 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $85 million or 1.9% of sales. Depreciation and amortization was $52 million in the quarter and $183 million for the full year. We expect 2018 depreciation and amortization to be approximately $200 million. Our businesses continue to generate excellent cash flow. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was a record $253 million and fourth quarter cash flow was $223 million, representing a very strong 137% of adjusted net income. Our full year cash flow was also excellent. Excluding the $50 million discretionary pension contribution made in the first quarter, 2017 operating cash flow was $883 million, up 17% from 2016 with full year free cash flow of $808 million or 133% of adjusted net income. For 2018, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 120% of net income. We continue to successfully deploy our strong cash flow on strategic acquisitions. In 2017, we deployed approximately $560 million on the acquisitions of Rauland, MOCON and Arizona Instrument and thus far in 2018 we have deployed approximately $235 million on the acquisition of FMH Aerospace. Total debt at December 31 was $2.17 billion, down from $2.34 billion at the end of 2016. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $646 million, resulting in a net-debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 27.5%. After the acquisition of FMH Aerospace, we have approximately $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter capping off the year with excellent results and high quality of earnings with our strong balance sheet, cash flows, proven growth strategies we are excited as we look ahead to 2018. Kevin?
Kevin Coleman: Great, thank you, Bill. Andrew, can we please open the lines for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: So margins continue to push higher here. As you look 2018, particularly on the organic side, how should we be thinking about that entering this year? How far can you push them going forward and obviously you’re investing in there as well?
Dave Zapico: Right, right. Well the way we think about it is we have a lot of runway for margins. And we think we can increase our margins, ex-acquisitions about 30 basis points. So the same thing we did in the 2017. So 30 bps is probably a good way to think about it. And if you look at our 2017 results, we got about – on the incremental sales we are up about 35% incremental margin and that’s what we’re targeting for 2018 also.
Allison Poliniak: Great. And then you touched on it a little bit in your remarks, but it’s sort of you’re expecting sort of a likely benefit from the Tax Reform and increased capital expenditures. Can you maybe talk to sort of the order increase that you’ve received thus far? Does it feel like it’s accelerating to you guys or not really?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, it’s a – I think our orders were accelerating before Tax Reform and its continuing. So, we can’t point to specific customers telling us that are ordering because of the Tax Reform, but we can’t point to broad-based order strength across our portfolio that’s continuing and it’s continuing into January. We’ve got – January orders were in line with what we expected. So it’s strong. It’s continuing its strength. It's all geographies and it’s all of our businesses. So it’s difficult to pinpoint how much is from Tax Reform and how much of it’s just the general synchronized growth across the globe, but it is the good market. The one point I add to that is a lot of customers are now talking about their next generations and new designs and some new projects that are floating into the pipeline. So it feels good looking forward.
Allison Poliniak: Great, thanks so much.
Dave Zapico: Great.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Andrew Obin: Yeah, good morning, guys.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Obin: Just sort of big picture question for companies that does a lot of acquisitions. How do you guys think about cost of capital and return hurdles as interest rates go up?
Dave Zapico: Right. Yeah, the one thing about our acquisition strategy is that we haven’t changed our key hurdle rate. So it’s the return on capital of 10% in a third year of owning a business for the return on invested capital. And we use that throughout the – in times when interest rates are lower and times when interest rates were higher. So the current environment is very similar to what we have been experiencing. So that – and we plan on applying the same process. So we think that’s reflected on our balance sheet. Our balance sheet as a return on total capital of a NOPAT average, total capital of about 12%, which is a really good rate for an acquisitive company and we consider our cost of capital of about 8%. So the strength between the 12% and the 8% is what we’re providing to our shareholders in the long-term. And we don’t think that we’re still going to stay focused on our disciplined approach and the 10% ROIC in year three. And we’re seeing a similar environment to what have seen over the two years. The pricing is elevated. There is plenty of cash chasing deals, but despite this we have been successful in deploying our free cash flow and value enhancing acquisitions.
Andrew Obin: Right, so you were never a spread company?
Dave Zapico: No, we’re never a spread company. We’ve always been an absolute company.
Andrew Obin: And just a question on payout ratio, and I apologize I delve in a little bit late; fairly significant increase in the payout has philosophy on dividends change going forward.
Dave Zapico: No, the philosophy hasn’t changed. The primary use of free cash flow is acquisitions. Secondarily, it’s opportunistic buybacks. And the dividend, we continue to pay a modest dividend. And basically, we last raised our dividend about four years ago. It was in the neighborhood of 50% and this is four years later and we’re raising it to 57%. So it’s the same philosophy we want to reward our shareholders because we’re very confident on our underlying cash flows, but it really doesn’t changed the fundamental capital allocation strategy of the business. M&A is the clear priority.
Andrew Obin: So we should not expect a series of dividend increases that run well ahead of earnings growth, right.
Dave Zapico: No, I would say no. I view this increase is catching up and I would not expect it to run ahead of earnings growth.
Andrew Obin: Thanks a lot guys, great quarter.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Bill Burke: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Robert McCarthy: I would echo the strong quarter, gentlemen, particularly the organic growth.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Robert McCarthy: A couple questions, a couple questions if you don't mind. I will leave – I will leave around the horn to Mr. Graham. But what I would ask is number one have you looked at a lot of serial acquisition stories, high quality, mid-caps like yourself have looked and some of actually changed accounting to going to excluding amortization. And now it looks like on the basis of my fuzzy math amortization for you on a guidance basis, I mean, it's something looks like it's – I don’t know north of $100 million a year, could be $0.50, maybe it’s much higher than that. But have you think that – made that accounting change because if you look at the underlying, how your business is run and operated. It's really about cash and backing that out might be a better way for investors to look at how to value your company over time. Have you looked at that and what are your thoughts?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, it's a great question. We get the question occasionally. We decided not to do it this year. We're still talking to our investors. I mean you just figure it out pretty easily. And we think our investors can figure it out. So we use the GAAP earnings to talk about our EPS. Some of our peers have changed the cash EPS. We're not saying that we're not going to do it and we're not saying that we’re going to do. We’ll think about it then we give everybody some heads-up if we’re going to do that, but right now we decided to stay a GAAP company.
Robert McCarthy: Okay. And just to amplify your comments about capital allocation. Obviously, you deployed a lot of capital recently, done some solid presumably niche and bolt-on deals. But where we stand today given – Tax Reform given how you’re feeling about your businesses? Could you talk about the state of play for how much capital you think you could deploy over the next two years in this environment to drive value?
Dave Zapico: I’d point to Bill’s comment. He talked about $1.5 billion of dry power essentially from cash and existing flexibility on our credit lines. And I also add to that the free cash flow of the business will be somewhere around $850 million next year. So if we add those two up, we clearly can deploy greater than $1 billion with relative ease and our stated strategy is to deploy our free cash flow. So that would be our target, but if we wanted to we could flex it and go to much higher levels, north of $2 billion. So that’s the way we think about it and we look for good targets and we want to make sure we’re deploying the capital with good businesses and our business that return on capital. So our strategy really is not capital constrained. It's our deal pipeline, and looking at these different deals that we have, all good businesses. But we have to pick the deals but we have the most value too. And in the selection of those deals is really the limber on the growth and we have a great pipeline, but we’re picking the deals in an environment that has higher prices and still giving our shareholders the same return on capital. If we get a larger deal or we get many smaller deals, we have a financial capacity to do them and we’re certainly increasing efforts on the – in the M&A. We now have an 11 individuals dedicated to the pipeline work and we feel real good about our pipeline.
Robert McCarthy: Just the last one, as a follow-up, I would say specifically in terms of large deals, is there tension in the pipeline to look at larger deals or is there a goal to look at larger deals? And how do you look at the opportunities out there because you get the fixed cost leverage of integrating these deals and getting good returns? I mean could you just comment on that?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, I mean, we have expanded our pipeline to include larger deals. Now, larger deals for us are not of the size of AMETEK or half the size of AMETEK. We’re talking about of kind of one notch up from what we’re looking to do, deals that are maybe $200 million, $300 million of revenue. And those are in our pipeline and we’re working through it. So we could do deal of that size and maybe deployments of capital of a $1 billion and we’re looking at those kind of business. Our financial flexibility looks compatible. But we don’t need to do those kinds of deals to deliver double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders. We’re staffed to do six to eight deals a year and that can be $50 million, $100 million deals and we’re perfectly comfortable doing of that size deal and growing at 15% a year on average.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks so much.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning. Happy, February.
Dave Zapico: Chris, good morning.
Christopher Glynn: See just I am wondering on the upside in the quarter was that more like backlog conversion was faster than expected or the kind of in quarter orders came in and converted? And if there's any insight in and answering the question?
Dave Zapico: Yeah, I think we executed very well and we were able to convert a lot of incoming orders in the quarter to sales. And there was some business, additional business investment tied to year end spend that resulted especially in our process business, some year-end spend that we were able to convert on. And we ended the year at $1.4 billion backlog. So we kind of have our cake and we got to eat it to because we had a great Q4 and we have real good visibility to 2018.
Christopher Glynn: And nice cake. And then on the Tax Reform as you look at your global corporate entities or the acquisitions you've done over time and the brick strategies over time, is there any key signification opportunities that might be significant from a cost perspective?
Bill Burke: I think as we – we obviously, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done as guidance gets issued and the like. I think we -- certainly, this will simplify things and we'll have to look at our structures. I don't think that would say that there's huge cost benefits that are going to come from that. I think it's going to be more about continuing to look at tax planning strategies and see if we can take the rate down from that 23% level that we have baked into the forecast. But that's going to be something that we’re going to really play out over the next year or more as we get the full understanding of it and be able to try and plan and act accordingly.
Christopher Glynn: Got it. Thanks, Bill.
Bill Burke: You’re welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Jeff on for Deane. My question is about your acquisition of FMH Aerospace. In the price-to-sales ratio, 4.7 times roughly, I mean it just looks notionally large. Can you maybe talk about your organic growth rates of that business and maybe the synergies and what percent of that business is aftermarket?
Dave Zapico: Sure, yeah, on a price-to-sales ratio, it may look a bit rich but it's 11 times EBITDA and it's a very profitable business. It's more profitable than the AMETEK average. So we bought a business that's really well positioned. They're a manufacturer of highly engineered products that facilitate the transfer of fuels and gas us at very high temperatures and pressures and really demanding applications. An example application would be in-air tanking refueler. So if you think about an in-air tanking refueler connecting to a jet and refueling it. FMH builds the components. They don't build the whole system, but they build key components within the air refueling systems. So these are very differentiated components. It's a unique business that has unique capability. They're a leader in a niche, attractive growth profile. We're at the high-single digit grower. And even though it's a very profitable business, we have a very healthy level of cost synergy built into our model. So in terms of the go-forward growth rate, we have a division of AMETEK, our TMS division that really is in the same market and has already made sales force to sell the FMH products globally and that's something they really haven't done. So we're really excited about what FHM does for AMETEK. It's an excellent strategic fit and we think it's a great business and we're going to get the same kind of returns on capital that we do with all our deals.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you. And just last maybe just talking about Tax Reform and M&A. So with the lower tax rate, we're expecting maybe less tax leakage on transactions. Are you seeing any more targets come on the market? Or do you expect more activity this year?
Dave Zapico: You know, our pipeline has been pretty full through 2017 and it's continuing in 2018. So it's not like we came in the door on January 1 and the target started coming in the door. These are very few things surprise us when they're sold because of our business development pipeline and our information's so good. And I would characterize it as a strong market, as strong as it was last year for us, but we really haven't seen a spike because of tax reform.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.
Matt Summerville: Thanks, good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Matt.
Matt Summerville: A couple of questions. First, where were you on price in 2017? What is your expectation for 2018? And then maybe if you could talk about where you were in terms of spread between price [indiscernible] in 2017 and what your expectation is for 2018?
Bill Burke: Right, I think the pricing for us improved a bit in the fourth quarter compared to the first half of the year. I will start with the Q4. And in Q4, we achieved price of about 1.5 points across our entire portfolio. And total inflation was up a bit more. It was about a little – a bit more than 1%. So we had a positive spread there. And it was very balanced across our portfolio with similar results and no real outliers. And when we look to 2018, we expect the conditions similar to Q4 to continue playing out. We have in our 2018 model for our budget about 1.5 points of price and we think inflation will pick up to about 1.2%. So we got a positive spread there. As you know we have been able to offset increasing cost with price. We're leaders in niche markets that speak to the differentiated nature of our AMETEK product portfolio. The leadership position we have in our niche markets and we look at it as only fair that we can pass inflation on to our customer base.
Matt Summerville: And as a follow-up, can you just give us a little more detail around what you're doing with restructuring or repositioning of the floor care and specialty motors business into the PMC, please, and what [indiscernible]?
Dave Zapico: Good question, Matt. Thanks. Yeah, we basically have – we've consolidated our floor care and specialty motors business into our precision motion control business given the strong operational and technology synergies that exist between those businesses. As we talked about the business over the last couple of years, we talked about our floor care business, migrating their business and customer portfolio away from the legacy floor care motors market into higher end markets and applications. And this transition has been incredibly successful. Now only about $50 million of our sales are in the floor care market. So it's a really, really small part of AMETEK. And those customer bases have changed to specialized industrial, food and beverage, which require higher levels of engineering support, technology development and provide stronger growth and margin characteristics. So we put those businesses together. We combined the management teams earlier in 2017 and then – we just really – there's some final stages, some strategic cost reductions that we're going – through this realignment cost that we're going to address. And we've actually now – if you think about what was the old differentiated EMG, one of the markets in the company, and floor care, we've actually combined floor care and now we're going to call that automation and engineered solutions. So that's the fourth segment, and it's really a result of this consolidation. So it's the old PMC plus EMIP, and that's reflects the automation demand driver for the PMC business and it includes the engineered solutions business.
Matt Summerville: Thanks, Dave.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Charles: Yes, Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Good morning, Richard.
Richard Charles: Dave, could you kind of speak maybe to the segments for 2018? As we look out, core growth for 2018 was kind of guided maybe 3% to 5%. Could you just speak to maybe how EIG and EMG falls into that 3% to 5% guide? And also, I just wanted to ask similar question for 2018 around aerospace and what the expectation is for all of aerospace?
Dave Zapico: Okay. Yeah, it's very similar with both EIG and EMG. We have 3% to 5% organic for both of them and total sales for both of them are high-single digits. So there's not much difference in the sales growth between the different groups. And it reflects the broad-based improvements that I talked to earlier. In terms of aerospace, our overall aerospace sales, we have a solid 2018. We were up mid-single digits in the fourth quarter, very solid year across all of our segments. They all grew in 2017. And we think that looking ahead in 2018, we're going to expect organic sales for overall aerospace business to be up mid-single digits with similar growth expected across each of our market segments. And the one change that we saw – really 2 changes that we saw in 2017, the military market really improved and we expect that continuing mid-single-digit growth for that. And we also saw some improvement in the business in regional jet market and we're expecting that to continue. So we really got a solid commercial environment. We want some share on business jets that’s allowing us to grow there and the military is strong. So we’re pretty optimistic about aerospace in 2018 and we think it will be a mid-single-digit grower for the total business.
Richard Charles: Okay. And then I just had a question around the gross margin in the quarter, if I – can I assume in the fourth quarter that much of that $16 million of realignment costs was taken against in COGS? I’m curious if you make that adjustment, gross margin looks a little bit more normalized, but the trend still down year-over-year. And I’m curious with the moving mix here, EIG strength, what’s the outlook for gross margin here? And maybe what’s kind of depressing that a little bit relative to the volume strength?
Bill Burke: Yes. I mean because we have so many different businesses on our portfolio, we really don’t focus on gross margin as much as operating income margin and there’s a lot of mixed dynamics and there are different product dynamics and there is the restructuring. So with positive price to inflation, there is not an issue or a problem of gross margin. So…
Richard Charles: Okay. And can you remind me some of the RD&E step-up also gets accounted for in the COGS. Is that correct?
Bill Burke: It does. If you think about that, almost all of our RD&E is in COGS. So that reflects the increased spending that we have. So that will be part of the gross margin and actually a little bit of divisional G&A shows up there too.
Richard Charles: Okay, alright.
Bill Burke: So that’s – it’s difficult to compare our G&A with other companies because of what it reflects. It’s just been a historical way we’ve done it.
Richard Charles: Yeah, I understand. And then…
Bill Burke: The operating income margins instead.
Richard Charles: Yeah, and then the last question, when you talk about the operational excellence savings and the commentary around maybe $85 million of savings targeted for 2018 versus slightly over $100 million in 2017 actual, any thought there? So a little less targeted savings. Is some of that just accounted for maybe in the realignment charge?
Bill Burke: Yes. If you think about the sourcing savings and material savings, which is the predominant driver of the cost last year, they’re about flat, its $65 million both years. So, still really, really good year in sourcing savings. What’s really happening is last year, we had some realignment expenses that benefited the year 2017 and the realignment that we talked about in the last quarter of 2017 is more long-term in nature. So we’ll get benefit from that, not so much benefit in 2018, but it will benefit in 2019 and 2020. So that’s the difference between those two numbers. The realignment charge is more long-term and the sourcing savings is about the same.
Richard Charles: Okay, alright, thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning guys. This is Tristan in for Joe today. I just wanted to maybe check your level of inventory and how it compares to the last few months and also the level of inventory at your partners and at your distributors. Thank you.
Dave Zapico: Yes. We don’t deal a lot through distributors. So a lot of our products are sold direct. So there isn’t usually a distribution inventory issue. I mean what I can say is our inventory terms were excellent. They were up, I guess, about 4.9, 4.8 turns in the quarter and last year Q4 2016 they’re about 4.4 turns. So a lot of the benefits that we got from working capital for improved inventory turn. So we're executing very well. The inventory is turning quicker. The working capital was, as Bill mentioned, less than 17% about 16.8%. So we’re operating very well. Inventory is turning. And in the niche custom business that we have, that’s a really good rate.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank, Dave. I’ll go back in the queue.
Dave Zapico: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brett Kearney with Gabelli and Company. Your line is now open.
Brett Kearney: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
Dave Zapico: Hi, Brett.
Brett Kearney: You touched on a bit in your prepared remarks, but I wanted to ask whether you’re seeing any indications at all thus far this year. I know it’s early, but just in terms of customers exploring or committing to more of the larger capital projects already this year?
Dave Zapico: Yes. I hit that a little bit. I mean we saw good capital projects in 2017. We saw them in – a little bit in the Middle East in terms of oil and gas. It helped our mid downstream business. We saw the defense market turn on projects had been shutdown for a while. And as we enter 2018, it seems like new projects are surfacing in our pipelines. It feels like some of our customers that we deal with on an OEM basis are designing new products. So it feels like its definitely solid and it feels like it could be accelerating, but we’re not factoring that into our guidance. We’re expecting the continuing growth, but there's a lot of activity in these sales pipelines.
Brett Kearney: Yep, thank you.
Dave Zapico: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with the BMO. Your line is now open.
Scott Graham: Hey, good morning David, Bill. Kevin, how are you?
Dave Zapico: Hey, Scott.
Bill Burke: Good morning.
Kevin Coleman: Good.
Scott Graham: I want to ask a question on organic and, obviously, the trends there have been good. Although you’ll admit that the comps have been easy. And now in the fourth quarter the comp gets harder and that will be harder again in 2018. Essentially, my question is this is that we see a pretty good order book. We’re coming out of the fourth quarter with momentum. You’re saying mid-single in the first quarter yet you’re saying 3 to 5 for the full year. Is that sort of may be more look before your leap guidance? Or is there something that you’re seeing maybe in the second half of the year where some market or group of market slows?
Dave Zapico: I don’t think we’re seeing any market slowdown or we’re not assuming any slowdown. And I think you might have answered your own question because we do have tougher comps later in the year. So the organic growth guidance of 4% at the midpoint assumes we have some – a little bit of easier comp in Q1. But as we progress through 2018, the comps are going to get difficult, but the markets are not slowing down.
Scott Graham: Fair enough. Is there anything that stops you – from where you sit today, Dave, anything that you think will stop you from getting to that 7% to 8% goal for acquisitions, adding to sales in that amount? It just sounds to me like the pipeline is pretty good. You announced a couple today. Are we – do you see – I don’t want to ask you if you have a line of sight, you never want line of sight on anything when it comes to M&A. But is there anything that you think that interrupts that?
Dave Zapico: The best way I can explain it is that I'm confident because we have such a refined M&A process. We have a dedicated team of M&A professionals. It allows for a broad set of opportunities from which we can identify the best fits. So I feel really confident that we'll be able to deliver that over the long run. But you know as well as I do on M&A, predicting a particular deal or 2 deals or 3 deals in a quarter or a year is pretty difficult because things can happen and we're very particular and we do a lot of due diligence, but I feel extremely confident because of our capability, our processes around deal sourcing and deal modeling, diligence and integration. So, incredibly confident on long-term to get that kind of number, but it's very difficult in the short term just by the nature of the M&A world.
Robert Scott: Understood and my last question is the [indiscernible]. Maybe you can kind of give us a sketch on the – sort of the business units themselves within each segment.
Dave Zapico: Right, I'll go through each of the markets and I'll start with our process business. Our process business had an excellent fourth quarter. Overall sales were up more than 25% driven by contributions from both acquisitions and organic growth. Rauland and MOCON are both performing exceptionally well and they're delivering solid performance while they’re successfully and positively integrating into AMETEK. And organic growth in the fourth quarter for Process was excellent. It was 10%. It was particularly robust with our high-end research instrumentation including business like CAMECA, Zygo and AMETEK, had very good, very good course especially in Asia. We also benefited in the quarter from some solid year-end spending across the board in process. And in 2018, we expect continued broad-based sales growth with organic sales up mid-single digits. Aerospace side, I answered Rick's question. I'll get with that one. Overall, mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. All of our segments were good. Military and business jets were particularly strong. And looking ahead to 2018, we expect organic sales for our overall aerospace business to be up mid-single digits with similar growth expected across each market segment. Our Power & Industrial segment finished the year strong with mid-single-digit growth, organic growth in the fourth quarter. We saw growth in both our Power & Industrial businesses with notable strength in our power instruments business. And in 2018, we expect low to mid-single-digit organic growth for our Power & Industrial businesses. And finally, as I mentioned previously, our fourth market, our automation and engineered solutions. Our automation and engineered solutions businesses completed an outstanding year, impressive double-digit organic growth sales in the quarter. We continue to see excellent growth across our businesses serving automation markets as well as our EMIP businesses. So looking ahead to 2018, we expect mid-single-digit organic growth from that market.

David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. The AMETEK business model continues to deliver exceptional results, with another outstanding high-quality quarter. We generated a record level of sales, with both strong organic sales growth and solid contributions from our recent acquisitions. We delivered excellent operating performance which drove a record level of diluted earnings per share and we generated significant level of operating cash flow with impressive free cash flow conversion, which speaks of the high-quality nature of AMETEK's performance. As a result, we are again raising our full-year 2017 guidance across all key metrics. Now, on to the financial and business highlights for the quarter. AMETEK's sales in the third quarter were a record $1.08 billion, up 15% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Organic sales were up 7%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency was a one-point benefit. We are very encouraged by the continued strong level of organic sales growth. It remains broad based and reflects the strength of our underlying niche businesses. In addition to the strong sales growth, we continued to see excellent growth in orders. Overall orders were up 16% in the quarter, while organic orders were up 9%. This level of organic growth drove our record backlog at nearly $1.4 billion. Operating income in the quarter was $232.8 million, up 16% from the same quarter of 2016. Operating income margins were 21.5%, up 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. Excluding the dilutive impact on margins of recent acquisitions, operating income margins in the quarter were 22%, up 70 basis points versus the same period in 2016. Third quarter diluted earnings per share were a record $0.66, an 18% increase compared to last year's third quarter of $0.56. Our businesses continued to operate extremely efficiently, leading to strong cash flow generation. Operating cash flow in the quarter was excellent at $239 million, up 41% over the prior year. Now, turning to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG sales in the third quarter were a record $671.6 million, up 16% versus the third quarter of 2016. Organic sales were up 5%, with the acquisition of Rauland and MOCON contributing 11% increase in sales. Foreign currency was a small tailwind in the quarter. EIG's operating income in the third quarter increased to $164.4 million, up 15% over the prior year and operating income margins were strong at 24.5%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions on margins, EIG margins were 25.6%, up 100 basis points over the prior year. The Electromechanical Group had a great quarter with broad-based sales growth and excellent operating performance. EMG third quarter sales were $413.2 million, up 13% year-over-year. Organic sales were very strong, up 11%, with the acquisition of Laserage contributing two points and foreign currency was a one-point benefit. EMG's third quarter operating income was $84.1 million, an increase of 18% versus the third quarter of 2016. Operating margins were excellent at 20.3%, up 80 basis points compared to the same period last year. In summary, the growth in performance across all of the AMETEK, both in the third quarter and over the first nine months of the year, has been excellent, with double-digit growth in sales and earnings through the first nine months of 2017. Now, before I discuss our updated outlook for the year, let me touch on some exciting recent events that highlight some of the success of our growth strategies. First, we're very pleased with the performance and integration of our recent acquisitions. With the acquisitions of Rauland and MOCON thus far in 2017, we have deployed approximately $520 million in capital and acquired approximately $225 million in sales. Related to these two acquisitions, MOCON, a leading provider of laboratory and field gas analysis instrumentation, recently launched a new system to measure the water vapor transition rate of ultra-high barrier materials. This new product will help MOCON expand into several new high-growth market adjacencies. The AQUATRAN Model 3 will out push the performance of highly engineered materials, such as flexible films and organic LED displays used in high-end televisions and electronics and photovoltaics for solar panels, which can be affected by moisture damage. The AQUATRAN system measures each molecule of water that passes through the sensor, providing highly sensitive, accurate, and repeatable results. Also, during the third quarter, Rauland, a leader in the design and delivery of critical communication solutions for hospitals and nursing care facilities, launched an exciting new product, the Responder 5000. This new solution was developed to assist nursing care facilities in providing the residents with a high quality of care by providing economic and effective workflow and communication solutions. As a result, the Responder 5000 can help nursing care facilities ensure compliance with Medicare value-based purchasing programs, leading to higher levels of reimbursement. So, the solution has also been customized for use in hospitals internationally, with efficient workflow and communication solutions for those markets. We are very pleased with the performance of these recent acquisitions and are very excited with the growth potential, given their attractive stream of new product offerings and their global and new market expansion opportunities: two pillars of AMETEK's four growth strategies. In addition to these new products from Rauland and MOCON, all our businesses continued to develop differentiated products and solutions to solve our customers' most challenging problems. The success of this work can be seen through our organic sales and orders growth, and also on our vitality index, which measures the share of sales coming from new products and solutions introduced within the last three years. In the quarter, our vitality index was very strong at 24%, reflecting excellent engineering and new product development capability, combined with our commitment to investing appropriately in innovation. In 2017, we expect to increase our investment in RD&E to approximately $220 million, which is roughly 5% of sales, and up 10% over 2016. Along with these new acquisitions and new products, our businesses continued to strengthen through our operational excellence initiatives. As we have highlighted throughout the year, we are rolling out several very exciting operational excellence initiatives focused on enhancing the organic growth opportunity across our businesses. Our teams are engaged and we are excited with the early results we have seen from these efforts. We also continue to drive impressive results in productivity improvements and cost reductions, as we continue to expect approximately $100 million in total operational excellence savings for all of 2017. Along with these savings, we continue to deliver excellent working capital management, leading to outstanding cash flow generation, which Bill will discuss further in a moment. One final bit of exciting news I would like to share involves AMETEK's Zygo business and their important contributions to the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to three scientists for their work in the observation of gravitational waves. Zygo, a supplier of optical metrology instruments, high precision optical components and complex electro-optical systems, manufactured critical components for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. The observatory successfully detected gravitational waves for the first time, and as a result, proved one of Albert Einstein's key elements in his general theory of relativity. This achievement speaks to the high quality and highly technical nature of our businesses and products and the positive impact they are making. We remain focused on strengthening our leadership in differentiated products and in continuing to develop important solutions for our research and science customers throughout the world. I would like to congratulate Zygo for their contributions to this important project. With that, let me finish with our updated outlook for the year. For all of 2017, we now expect overall sales to increase by low-double digits on a percentage basis compared to 2016. Organic sales are now expected to increase mid-single digits on a percentage basis over the prior year. Once again, we have increased our earnings guidance range for 2017. We now expect earnings to be $2.57 to $2.58 per diluted share, up 12% over 2016's adjusted diluted earnings per share. This is an increase from our prior guidance range of $2.46 to $2.52. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we are anticipating overall sales to be up low-double digits on a percentage basis, with organic sales up mid-single digits. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share are expected to be $0.66 to $0.67, an increase of 14% to 16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 adjusted earnings. To summarize, AMETEK delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter and we are well positioned for a strong finish to 2017. Our world-class teams are operating their businesses very well, which is producing high-quality earnings growth and providing a solid foundation for future success through our four growth strategies. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year. Then, we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. As Dave mentioned, our businesses continue to perform very well, generating record results during the third quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights. In the third quarter, core selling expenses were up in line with core sales growth. General and administrative expense in the third quarter were up $2.7 million over the prior year, due largely to higher compensation expense. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.9%, in line with last year's third quarter rate of 25%. For 2017, we now expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 26.5%. As we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year rate. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was excellent at 17.9% of sales in the third quarter, down from 20.8% in the same period of 2016. Capital expenditures were $18 million for the quarter, and $46 million through the first nine months of 2017. We expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $45 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $180 million. Our businesses continue to generate excellent cash flow. Third quarter operating cash flow was $239 million, a 41% increase compared to the third quarter of 2016. Free cash flow in the quarter was $221 million, an outstanding 144% of net income. For the full year, excluding the $50 million pension contribution we made in the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 125% of net income. Our primary use of this strong cash generation is to support strategic acquisitions. As Dave mentioned, we've been very active on this front in 2017, deploying approximately $520 million on the acquisitions of Rauland and MOCON. Total debt at September 30 was $2.43 billion, up from $2.34 billion at the end of 2016. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $736 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 31%. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.8 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, the performance from our businesses during the quarter was outstanding and provided high quality of earnings. We look forward to closing out a strong year, and remain well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Bill. Andrew, we'd like to open the line for questions, please.
Operator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning, guys. Great quarter.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Now, I will ask a question. If I look at your operating leverage back in sort of 2012, 2013, 2014 period, it does seem it was a tad higher versus what we're getting right now. Can you just talk about specific challenges of coming out this prolonged downturn and just how much costs you need to add and whether we can get back to the old operating leverage or this is the kind of level we should be thinking as new normal? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure, Andrew. We think we had a great quarter margin wise. We were 21.5%, up 20 basis points. But excluding acquisitions, as I said in the prepared remarks, they were actually 22%, up 70 basis points. And if you go to the group lines, the EIG and EMG, ex acquisitions, were actually up 100 basis points in each group. And we saw incrementals, core incrementals in Q3 were up 39% on the incremental volume. So, we're very pleased with the results and we believe it's a good thing for our shareholders when AMETEK acquires lower-margin businesses. And what you're seeing is the Rauland and MOCON, when we acquired them, they were low to mid-teens EBITDA businesses. And AMETEK is obviously much more profitable. So, we improve the margins of those businesses substantially and they may be dilutive to margins for the short-term. But, ends up driving tremendous value creation in the long run and excellent returns on capital. So, we're very pleased with the performance of the strategy and we think it's endorsed with what we're trying to do with the business.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: 39%, nothing to sneeze at. Another question, can you just talk about, Dave, since you've taken over, what are the changes that you're implementing? We're sort of hearing about sort of a more structured approach to internal business systems. What can you share about what's happening inside AMETEK, culture wise?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Andrew, I've been with the company for 27 years and I was part of the culture of the past and part of the culture going forward, and really, the culture hasn't changed. I mean, the two areas that we've talked about, we've definitely put a larger emphasis on our organic growth and we have a structured approach to that, and we made it part of our operational excellence program and we're really getting traction with that organic growth, and the tools that we're adding to our toolkit to help our businesses understand the opportunity. And then, the second issue is related to the size and scale of the business. We want to double the earnings of the company over the next five years. So, we increased our acquisition pipeline of businesses a little bit larger, $200 million to $400 million in revenue. Prior to that time, they weren't in the pipeline of deals. So, they're working through the deal pipeline and we're looking at those bigger deals and we think we can add the same kind of value to them. But, it's the same company. The strategy is flexible enough to tweak it when it's needed. But, we feel really confident we're on the right track and headed in the right direction for the next five years.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Terrific. Thank you so much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Dave, Bill, Kevin. How are you?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I was wondering if you wouldn't go through your typical by-business...
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Sub-segment sure (19:56).
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. But even, if I may, before that, could you talk about the orders as the quarter progressed? And obviously, I'm not talking about dollars because of seasonality, but on a year-over-year percentage change basis. Because your second half of last year starts to show some more stability in orders. And just kind of wondering what that looked like as each month passed? And now with October done, if you can maybe comment there, as well?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Our orders for the quarter organically were up 9%. So, we had a very strong quarter in orders and it was broad based across end markets and geographies, and it followed a typical pattern. So, we started the quarter a little bit lower and we finished really strongly. So, the orders strengthened through the quarter. And that answers that question. I'll get into the sub-segments. Go across around the sub-segments of AMETEK. I'll start with our overall Aerospace business. Sales for overall Aerospace were up low-single digits in the quarter. Similar to last year, we saw strong growth across – similar to last quarter, we saw strong growth across our military business. Our military business has really picked up. We also saw solid growth across our business and regional jet business due to a ramp up in shipments and support of new program wins. And for all of 2017, we continue to expect our Aerospace business to be up low to mid-single digits with growth expected across each of our market segments. In addition to the solid growth this year, the Aerospace business is a long-term business and you have to win new programs. And our Aerospace teams continue to have excellent success in delivering new long-term program wins across a wide range of platforms. Year-to-date, our teams have already secured over $300 million in life of program awards across a range of commercial, business jet, and military platforms. Next, I'll talk about process. Our process business has had an excellent third quarter, with overall sales up 20%, driven by contributions from the acquisitions of Rauland and MOCON and by strong mid-single digit organic growth. The organic sales growth was broad based across our process businesses. And we saw excellent growth across our ultra-precision technologies, our UPT business, especially in our Zygo and our TMC, Precitech business units. And given the quarter's solid performance, we now expect organic sales for the process businesses to be up mid-single digits for the year. Well, we've increased that a bit. Our power and industrial business performed very well in the third quarter with solid mid-single-digit organic sales growth. We saw solid growth from each power and industrial segment, particular strength was across our power, test and measurement segment. And we continue to expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up low to mid-single digits for the full year. Our differentiated EMG businesses continued to perform very well, with another quarter of excellent growth as end demand remains solid across our key markets. In the third quarter, organic sales for our differentiated EMG businesses were up low-double digits, with particularly strong growth in our EMIP and Precision Motion Control businesses. Within our Precision Motion Control businesses, we're continuing to see very strong growth within our Dunkermotoren business, as it is benefiting from strong conditions across its key automation markets. So, for all of 2017, we now expect organic sales for all differentiated EMG to be at mid to high-single digits versus 2016. And finally, for Floorcare & Specialty Motors, our smallest segment, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were up low-single digits in the third quarter, as this business continues to see solid demand across its key elements and across its key markets and key customers. And for 2017, we continue to expect organic sales for this business to be up mid-single digits.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That'll do it. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi, good morning, all.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Just want to come back to the growth initiatives. Obviously, a lot of traction there on the channel development and some of the measures you're taking internally. I guess, if you were to look at the order rate of 9% in the quarter, are you able to identify or unbundle that rate between what's being driven by the market and what share gain and some of the opportunities that you think you're winning based on some of these initiatives?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes, we are definitely seeing broad based improvement across our end markets and we're also seeing improved geographical strength throughout the world. But, with 7% organic growth, we're clearly win share also, both in Q3 and as you see in the first nine months of the year. And we're certainly seeing tangible success from some of the organic growth initiatives that you mentioned, and we also continue to see great success from our new product development efforts driving market share gains. But it's very difficult to dissect those in our niche businesses. And so, we're definitely growing share, and if I point you to some businesses where I saw excellent performance, is our PMC business. The automation market is about 10% of sales for AMETEK. And participation in this market is the result of some acquisitions that we based around our core motor technology, and it's resulted in the acquisitions of Dunkermotoren and Haydon Kerk. And really those businesses, working in unison, have perfected the art of delivering custom automation subassemblies to customers and they're seeing tremendous growth and the growing share in a good market. We're also growing share in our Ultra Precision Technologies business. But in general, across the board, we're motivated, we're winning share, and we're also benefiting from improvements in end markets and improvements in geographies, and it's very difficult to break those out.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Understood. And then, just back to EIG operating margins, obviously some dilutive pressure from the two deals in 2017. But, I guess, as you normalize, or you think about the construct into 2018, what was the headwind this year? How much more runway do you have over the next 12 months to improve the operational performance in those businesses? And I guess, I'm trying to get at, what's sort of a good placeholder for EIG margins into 2018 as these integrations kind of run their course?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. I understand the question. As we always do, we'll provide our guidance for 2018 when we release our fourth quarter earnings in late January. And our businesses in both EIG and EMG are going through their detailed budget work, and we'll be meeting with each business this month to review those plans for next year. So, I'm really not in a position to comment on our expectations for 2018. But I will say that we've stated externally that we think there's margin expansion opportunities for the company. And the number that we've used, as far as the eye can see is 30 basis points to 40 basis points. And we get to that number by taking the high contribution margins of our business, of 40-plus percent, 35% contribution margins and adding to that our pricing power, and adding to that our tremendous operating capability. So, as we sit here and we look out long term, we'll certainly be expanding margins, but I don't want to comment specifically on a group or a business because we haven't done the work yet.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then, just one follow-up. You said 39% core incrementals. Presumably, most of the pressure, sort of one-time pressure would be in EIG. Electromechanical incrementals were kind of 27%. So, implicitly, much higher in EIG on a core basis. What were they, on a core basis, if you remove some of the deal noise in EIG?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, it was over 50% on a core basis. I think it was 57%. So, you're right on that.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Brett.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Thank you. Just a quick one in terms of where you were in the quarter on pricing versus raw material input costs, and whether or not you have any sort of concern over inflationary pressures heading into 2018, perhaps more so than you were heading into 2017?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure, Matt. Pricing actually improved in Q3 versus the first half of the year for us. So, we achieved 1.3% across our entire portfolio, and total inflation was about 1%. And it was very balanced across our portfolio, with similar results in all our different businesses. So, we are very pleased with that. And as you know, some other industrial companies have not been able to offset inflationary costs with increased pricing. So we were concerned with this trend and made sure all our business leaders were aware of it, and we're very pleased with the results. The results speak to the differentiated aspect and nature of AMETEK's product portfolio and our leadership position in the niche markets that we're in. And, as I said before in the prior quarter, what you see generally in 2016, the customers will migrate to – we have a good, better, best pricing marketing philosophy within the AMETEK portfolio. So, often, when times are tough and customers don't have a lot of capital to spend, they'll buy our good products. And as the markets tend to improve, customers will buy a fully-featured product, that are maybe the best. And we'll see pricing expand with that. So, we are pleased to see 1.3 points of price in the quarter and we feel good for fourth quarter that kind of performance will be able to continue.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: And then, just a follow-up on backlog. You continued, I believe so, at least, continued to build backlog throughout the year. What has been the key sort of either business or end market contributors to that build? And do you expect further expansion in Q4? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Our backlog was a record at $1.4 billion and it was broad based. I mean, we had positive book-to-bill in EIG and EMG. So, as we had said in prior quarters, with some of our longer-cycle businesses, they're not going to necessarily ship in the next quarter or the current quarter. They're going to be out there in the backlog. So, that's what you see happening. You see our longer cycle businesses strengthening.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Got it. Thanks, David.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks, good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, just wanted to – you talked about areas where you're gaining share. Just wanted to see if you could draw a distinction between gaining share or actually creating market size with some of your applications.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, creating markets is something that we're doing with some of our technologies, like our – in our Materials Analysis business. And we're doing adjacency work there and adjacency work on our UPT business. And those adjacency works were often taking core technologies and combining it with other technologies into new markets and creating some markets. Our atom probe for our Materials Analysis division will be that kind of business, where there's really no competition, because we've got the only person that manufactures atom probes. And so, we're creating a market there. And creating a market could take time, and there's a lot of missionary work done on the expenses. We're doing some missionary work like that with our Creaform business, also, with our – and our UPT business with some of the 3D metrology. So, that's happening. But, what you really see is, in general, good markets and share gains adding to 7% organic growth.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. And just in terms of the M&A pipeline, I think some areas like metrology and power quality, you've done a fair amount of consolidation already. What platforms you're currently seeing as particularly attractive in terms of the fragmentation out there and ripeness for you to step up the consolidation?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. Well, we have a dedicated team of about 10 M&A professionals who work closely with our businesses to identify strategic acquisitions and we have each of our business units develops an acquisition strategy. So, we have a lot of people working on a lot of things across a broad set of opportunities which we can identify, find good fits for AMETEK and remain disciplined in our return metrics. So, we need a big pipeline. We've got a lot of people working on it and we're searching for deals in a lot of areas.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the color.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. You've actually got Sawyer Rice on here for Nigel. Maybe just, firs, a high level question on EPS reporting. We've seen some news from other companies around the industry, on shifting to a cash EPS or an EPS that excludes the amortization. Just wanted to know if you guys have had any – if that's something you guys have looked at or any thoughts on that metric there.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Being an acquisitive company, we certainly would have a benefit if we excluded the amortization. But we reported – we're a GAAP company and at this time, we decided to not to do that at this point. We've been talking to our investor base about it. Even within the same shops, there's a bit of an argument within our investor base if we do it or not, so we're listening to it. And we certainly don't want to put ourselves at a disadvantage, but we report GAAP numbers and we haven't made a decision to do cash EPS reporting. We've reported the amortization, so it's out there and it can be calculated and figured out. But, we have no plans to do it at this time. That's probably the best way to state it.
Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then, maybe just one more, if I could squeeze it in here. On the EMIP backlog, just any color on the visibility you have in that business? And then, again, maybe some color on how we should think about orders phasing through 4Q and into 2018, in terms of conversion and sales. Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. In Q3, our EMIP business showed a continuing positive sequential trend. Sales were strong. Orders were also strong in the quarter, a bit better than the EMG average for organic sales. And for the year, for EMG – for EMIP, we're projecting mid to high-single-digit organic growth in line with the EMG average. So, very pleased with what's happening in that business. Very pleased with the sequential growth and it feels like our customers are back to normal and we're executing well.
Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Congratulations, guys, on a strong quarter.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Robert.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess, dovetailing some of the other questions that have come on about margins, maybe you could give us a state of play for your end markets around specialty metals and oil and gas, and obviously it relates to certain divisions as well. But, how has been the incremental margin performance there? Has it been in line? Because, I think the previous expectation, sort of (36:46) was probably in the 40% to 50% range? Have we been seeing it there? Was it a major incremental driver for your incremental margin strength at EMG? And then, how do we think about in the context of these end markets whether we've already seen the bolus of kind of the rebound or is that more on the common fourth quarter and going into 2018?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we're continuing to see our orders strong and there was broad-based improvement. So, orders were ahead of sales in a lot of our markets and a lot of our regions, so we're bullish about that. And our incremental margins were 39%. And with the contribution of the margin to the business is about 40%. So we think we're performing at a very strong level. And with the pricing power added to that, that's how we ended up with the EIG and EMG core margins at the group line, up 100 basis points. So, we're really pleased with – when you get under the hood, the margins are doing great and we look at it, even in the financial statements, with the acquisitions are doing very great. So, we're very pleased with our margin performance and we're very pleased with some of the pricing power we saw in the quarter.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I guess – but the spirit of the question is maybe drilling into the specific end markets around oil and gas and specialty metals to see what was the relative mix in those areas and whether that mix is going to be on the come, have we seen it? Kind of, what's the timing of that kind of incremental strong mix?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, the one point with metals, there is a dynamic there with metals inflation. So, as metals inflation increases, we pass that through to our customers. So, when you look at the EMG organic sales rate of 11%, about a point of that was from metals inflation. So, if you want incremental or contribution margin, it will be on a lower sales number. So, that may be what you're asking a question about. And in terms of EIG, we're really seeing, in the oil and gas business, the upstream market is coming back very strong. We're seeing high-single-digit growth in the upstream and low-single-digit growth in the downstream. And we're also differentiated in niches, we didn't really give up much price in the downturn. So, we've got really strong pricing in oil and gas, and those markets are improving and it's a high contribution margin business and we're optimistic about the future.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, it sounds, from Brett Linzie's comments – questioning, obviously, the EIG margins were kind of in the high-50s on a core basis. And then, EMG was kind of in the high-20s. So, that speaks to that dynamic you're talking about. So, I think that's an important nuance. The other thing ...
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: So, to be specific, EIG was 57% core incremental and EMG was 33%.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Math has never been my strong suit. And then, finally, just on size decile, is there – do you think there's a strategic imperative here for the company, just given how long it takes to do a deal, the fixed cost and association with specing deals – getting done deals over the goal line, et cetera, et cetera. Could we see larger deals here given your fire power? How should we think about kind of the odds that your pipeline is maybe more shaped towards something larger?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Well, bigger deals are working in the pipeline. And you may see us announce a bigger deal every couple of years. But clearly, the core acquisition, the thing that AMETEK is really good at, is buying businesses in that $50 million to $150 million range, and that is the predominant acquisitions that you're going to see from us going forward. Our M&A team is setup to process four to six deals of these simultaneously, and we're out looking at a lot of things. Our pipeline remains active. Our pipeline is very active. We're busy, and we're excited about the quality and the breadth of our pipeline. And you can't ever predict when something's going to transact in the short term, but we don't feel any need to stretch and do a bigger deal. We think there's plenty of opportunities in typical size deals, but at the same time, we're starting to look at slightly larger deals. They are by no means mergers of equals or anything like that. These are $200 million to $300 million revenue businesses, but we think we can add a lot of value. But, I would say that the predominant acquisition will be those $100 million deals that we create a lot of value with going forward.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys, good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Allison.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Dave, could you talk about R&D, 5% of sales today? Any changes to where you're eyeing that R&D? Obviously, there's some more technical aspects of your portfolio. And I guess, is that an appropriate amount, or should we be increasing it going forward? Any thoughts there?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I think the 5% is appropriate. And we've been very consistent over a long period of time, and the R&D was increased about 10% this year. So, healthy increase and we think we're getting a great return on that. And as you know, the way we manage that, our individual business units put together an R&D plan, those individual businesses will present their plans during their budgets and during their strat plans, and we'll critique them. But they're driving where they're spending their R&D. Certainly, with the higher technology nature and with the larger size of EIG, we spend a bit more on EIG than EMG, but we've been a consistent spender over the long-term and we're really happy with what's happening. We have up-to-date fresh products and we're winning share. So, we're very pleased with our R&D efforts. And I can just also add that over the past few years, we've added a tremendous capability in India. We have about 110 engineers over there that are augmenting our product development capability. And in our niche markets, we have some of the rock stars of the industry, in terms of our engineering capability with people that really know the products and the applications and take the technology forward. So, we have a great niche business of great technologies and we think we're spending appropriately.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. And then, just going back to the M&A pipeline, you talked about it being active, as the industrial economy recovers. Has there been any, I guess, push-back, changes to multiples? Any different color that you've been seeing there?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, sure. I mean, the current environment, it's very similar to what we've been experiencing recently. And pricing is elevated, there's no doubt about that. There's plenty of cash chasing deals. Despite this, we've been successful in deploying our free cash flow on acquisitions that will enhance the value of the company. So, we are really parsing a very robust pipeline to find the deals where we can remain disciplined in our return metrics. And we'll select the deals and we'll do the deals that – and we're focused on return on capital when we do a deal. So, we have $1.8 billion of fire power and really optimistic with what I see in the pipeline.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi, good morning. This is Jeff Reive on for Deane Dray. Maybe to continue with some of the M&A multiple. So, given the multiples are fairly high, are you guys making any considerations for portfolio pruning actions?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: We ended our strategic planning process in the first half of the year, and we're very comfortable with our portfolio at this time. Our strategy is to focus on a broad, diverse set of niche markets, and we look to grow organically and through acquisitions in these niches. We don't want to become overexposed to any single market or any single customer. And we've weathered a bit of a downturn over the past couple of years, and all of our businesses have a bright future looking out the next two or three years. So, right now, that's our position. And certainly, we look at it at least annually, and those decisions can change. But, right now, we're very comfortable with our entire portfolio.
Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And just one more. I know you're not giving any 2018 guidance, but could you provide some qualitative, maybe broader macro commentary for your setup into 2018?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. I mean, we feel good about our markets. We're obviously very happy with the performance we have. Our execution is excellent, and we expect our execution to continue. But, I want to hear from our teams before we put any numbers out there for 2018.
Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brett Kearney (45:59) with Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Brett (46:07).
Unknown Speaker: I was just wondering if you can talk at all about the recent additions and, I guess, promotions you've had within the executive team, and any additional hires kind of contemplated there in order to achieve your growth objectives?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: There is a couple of recent promotions – we're in the finance world. So, I'll let Bill talk about them.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. We have added Treasurer to AMETEK, his name is Dalip Puri. He's been Treasurer with several other large companies prior to joining AMETEK. So, we're happy to have him come along and augment the team there. He's got a really strong background in treasury, and we're pleased to include him as a part of the team. And then, the second addition was Brian Nash, who we promoted from our Power Systems and Instruments division as our VP of Operational Finance. And that's as we grow as a company, we want to make sure that we've got an adequate group of folks here in corporate to support our businesses, and really to help, as we get larger, to drive the AMETEK culture through the acquisitions and make sure that we maintain the strong disciplines that we've had over a long number of years. And promoting one of our best divisional folk up into a corporate role is great, and then, we'll back-fill from there. So, very pleased with the strengthening of the corporate finance team over the course of the last six to eight months.
Unknown Speaker: Great. Thank you, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. I know we're not going to get 2018 guidance here, but just – I want to kind of put the EMIP business into the appropriate context with metal prices up and aircraft build rates expected to ramp next year. So, can you kind of maybe frame out a scenario as to how that business enters the year? I mean, could we be looking at kind of like a material move in that segment of EMIP next year, particularly some of the specialty metals stuff and the connectors?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, I see – with EMIP, we're seeing in 2016, there was a financial problem in the metals market and we were really well positioned with niche products. And we told you at that time that the end markets were good, but the metals market in between us and our end customers were poor. So, what you really saw was that market in some distress. And what you really see now with the year, mid to high-single digit growth with our EMIP business is really a reflection of that improvement. So, we think we're at a level now that we're performing very well at and we're very pleased with the EMIP.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: It probably wouldn't be insane to think that that could even accelerate further as the build rates go higher, is that fair?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I'm not going to comment on 2018, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Fair enough. Maybe you can comment a little bit on how the front end of your business looks today versus maybe how it looked a year or two ago. I mean, I know you, guys, with an engineering background had a bit more focus on driving the front end and the sales channel more recently. So, how does that look today? How do you feel about that now versus maybe when you stepped into the role?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I feel really good about what's happening on the front end of our business. And we wanted to make our customer-facing capability as really as strong as our operational and engineering capability. And we're using some tools. I talked about that growth kaizens in the prior call where we're getting after ways to improve our distribution channel in our niche markets. We have a focus on digital marketing now to take some of our businesses that are truly world-class and bring all of them up to that level. We have a program on sales force effectiveness that involves the leadership development and compensation of our sales force. We're focusing on the aftermarket side of our business. We think there's opportunities to grow there. So, I'm very pleased with what's happening in the front end of our business and the focus on improving organic growth.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, Dave.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, good morning. The prior commentary, you talked about or at least referenced broad-based growth globally, geographically. So, I was just curious if you could drill down into that how the various geographies look, and specifically, I know North America, it kind of lag Asia, Europe through the first half of the year. And specifically, maybe give some color on North America and which businesses you're seeing gain some strength there, because seemingly that's the case.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. That's an excellent point, because what we really saw this quarter was tremendous strength in the U.S. Our U.S. business was up high-single digits, and it was improving sequential trend from about, I think it was low-single-digit, 1% actually last quarter. So, we saw a tremendous strength in the U.S. and it was broad-based strength. It was a military business. It was our aerospace business. It was our metals business, it was oil and gas. It was really strong. It was across the board. So, we're very pleased to see that. In Europe, we were up mid-single digits, in line with recent trends. That was also broad based, and notable strength. I mentioned our Dunkermotoren business was very strong in Europe. Our process business was very strong in Europe. And in Asia, we had another great quarter, up high-single digits, continuing the growth that we've been seeing. So, across the geographies, we're very pleased with what we're seeing.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And so, just one follow-up. So, it has been good to see the outlook ratchet up as we've gone through the year and I think you made reference to higher compensation as well. Any way to size what that year-over-year delta is going to probably shake out for 2017 in compensation or as a margin headwind year-over-year?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, our G&A in Q3 was up about 20%, and it was largely driven by higher compensation expense. So, that would be the best way to-Bill?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: It's a $10 million kind of number for that.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: For the full year?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: For the full year.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. So, with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Andrew. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And as a reminder, a replay of today's call can be accessed in the Investors section of ametek.com. Thank you and have a great day.

David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had another excellent quarter. We delivered results that exceeded our expectations and continue to see very solid growth in both sales and orders. This growth is broad-based across our businesses. Our businesses are executing very well, which is evident in our strong operating performance and cash generation. This strong sales and operating performance is translating into excellent earnings results, with diluted earnings per share in the second quarter up 10% over the prior year. As a result, we have again raised our full year earnings guidance range. Now, on to the financial and business highlights for the quarter. Sales in the second quarter were a record $1.06 billion, up 9% compared to the same quarter in 2016. Organic sales were up 4%, acquisitions added 6%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter. We are very encouraged with the continued strong level of organic sales growth as it again exceeded our expectations. We also saw excellent growth in orders, with overall orders up 20% and organic orders up a very strong 12%. This order performance follows a strong order performance we saw in the first quarter and is driving a record level of backlog at over $1.3 billion. Operating income in the quarter was $232.4 million, up 6% from the second quarter of 2016. Reported operating income margins were 21.8% in the quarter with core margins at 22.7%, up 30 basis points versus the prior year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.65, an increase of 10% compared to last year's second quarter of $0.59 per share. Our strong operating performance continues to translate into excellent cash flow generation. Our operating cash flow in the quarter was excellent, with free cash flow conversion at 123% of net income. Now turning to the individual operating groups; first, the Electronic Instruments Group. In the quarter, EIG sales were a record $657.7 million, up 10% versus the second quarter of 2016. Organic sales were up 2%. The acquisitions of Rauland, Nu Instruments, and HS Foils contributed 9% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. EIG's operating income for the second quarter was very strong at $165.2 million, up 9% versus the same period in 2016, with operating income margins an excellent 25.1%. The Electromechanical Group had another great quarter with robust sales and orders growth. Overall sales were up 7% versus the second quarter of 2016. Organic sales were also up 7%, with 1% acquisition growth, offset by a 1% foreign currency headwind. EMG's second quarter operating income was $85.6 million, up 7% over the prior year, with operating income margins a very strong 21%. Overall, our results for the quarter were outstanding. AMETEK is performing very well and we are poised for a strong second half of the year. Before I discuss our updated outlook for the year, let me touch on developments and our four growth strategies. First, acquisitions. We are very pleased with our efforts on the acquisition front. We completed the acquisition of MOCON on June 22, following shareholder and regulatory approvals. MOCON is the leading provider of laboratory and field gas analysis instrumentation to research labs, production facilities and QC departments, in food and beverage, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. We are very excited about this acquisition, and I would like to welcome the MOCON team to AMETEK. With the acquisitions of MOCON and Rauland, two very high-quality businesses, AMETEK has deployed approximately $520 million in capital thus far in 2017. Our M&A and business development teams remain very active in developing our acquisition pipeline. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deploy our free cash flow on value-enhancing acquisitions. And as we've proven, AMETEK has a robust acquisition process in place to integrate and improve acquired businesses. Next, new product development. We continue to design and develop new products and solutions to solve our customers' most complex and challenging problems. We have outstanding engineering talent, combined with excellent new product development capability. Our vitality index, which measures the portion of total sales coming from new products, was excellent at 25% of sales in the second quarter. This level of vitality speaks to the quality and success of our new product development efforts. I wanted to highlight one example of a new product introduced in the second quarter, the Creaform MaxSHOT Next. The MaxSHOT Next is a new optical coordinate measuring system designed for large-scale metrology projects mainly in the aerospace, automotive and transportation industries. With this new product, Creaform has achieved a major industry milestone by developing an intelligent measurement solution that autonomously guides users to the right measurements with 40% more accuracy and unparalleled ease of use. This product received the prestigious Red Dot Design Award for Design Excellence in 2017. Creaform is an excellent example of a business that has generated significant organic growth and excellent market expansion through the development of new products and solutions around this core 3D metrology. Across all of our businesses in 2017, we expect to increase our investment in R&DE to approximately $220 million, which is roughly 5% of our sales. This is an increase of approximately 10% over 2016. We also continue to expand in new markets around the world. International sales in the second quarter made up 51% of our total sales with very strong organic growth in China, India, the Middle East and other parts of Southeast Asia, due to the investments we have made to expand our presence in these regions. In addition to these incremental investments, we have also expanded our operational excellence capabilities with new tools started improving our sales, marketing and channel management processes. One of the new tools are Growth Kaizens. Growth Kaizens are specific, continuous improvement projects targeted at expanding our market share in an attractive growth market or geography where a business unit may be underpenetrated. About one year into our rollout, we are very pleased with the success we are seeing and expect expansion of this growth Kaizen process across more of our businesses will drive continued incremental growth opportunities. We're also pleased with our efforts to improve overall efficiency and drive operational savings. For all of 2017, we continue to expect approximately $100 million in total operational excellence savings. In addition to this level of savings, our teams continue to drive meaningful improvements in working capital, thus driving improved operating performance and cash flow generation. Bill will provide more specific details on our working capital performance, but I wanted to commend our teams for their great work in this area. Now, let me switch to the updated outlook for the year. For all of 2017, we now expect overall sales to increase high-single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2016. Organic sales are now expected to be up low- to mid-single digits. We have increased our earnings guidance range for 2017 to $2.46 to $2.52 per diluted share, up 7% to 10% over 2016 adjusted earnings. This is an increase from our prior guidance range of $2.40 to $2.48. For the third quarter of 2017, we are expecting overall sales to be up approximately 10% with organic sales up low-single digits. We anticipate diluted earnings per share for the third quarter will be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62, up 7% to 11% compared to the third quarter of 2016. To summarize, the second quarter results were outstanding with high-quality earnings growth driven by sales and superb operating performance. The exceptional work that our world-class teams have put in to the first half of the year has positioned the company for a very strong earnings growth in 2017. Through our four growth strategies, we are focused on maximizing the company's potential in our improving markets, and investing in the future to provide both short- and long-term success. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. As Dave mentioned, our businesses performed very well in the second quarter, delivering excellent cash flow and operating results that exceeded our expectations. I'll provide some financial highlights. In the second quarter, core selling expenses were up less than core sales growth. Our second quarter general and administrative expenses were up $5 million over the second quarter of 2016, due largely to higher compensation expense, including costs associated with the retirement of our Executive Chairman. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 26%, down from the second quarter of 2016 rate of 27.5% due to ongoing tax planning initiatives and the benefit from stock-based compensation. For 2017, we now expect our tax rate to be approximately 27%. Please keep in mind that actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. Working capital, defined as receivables, plus inventory, less payables, was an excellent 17.9% of sales in the quarter, down from 19.8% in last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million for the quarter and $28 million for the year to date. For the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be between $75 million and $80 million. Second quarter depreciation and amortization was $44 million and we expect full year 2017 depreciation and amortization to be approximately $180 million. We continue to generate very strong cash flow. In the quarter, operating cash flow was $199 million, up 5% from the second quarter of 2016. Free cash flow was $185 million or 123% of net income. For the full year, excluding the $50 million pension contribution we made in the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 125% of net income. We've been very active in deploying our free cash flow this year. In the second quarter, we deployed approximately $184 million on the acquisition of MOCON that brings our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2017 to approximately $520 million. Total debt at June 30 was $2.4 billion, up from $2.34 billion at the end of 2016. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of approximately $515 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 34%. At quarter end, we had approximately $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. To summarize, the performance from our businesses was outstanding and provided a high-quality of earnings. We remained well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Bill. Andrew, we're now ready to open up for questions.
Operator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global. Your line is now open.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Thanks. A couple of questions. First, can you talk about the EIG business for a moment and maybe what drove the organic or the deceleration in organic growth in that segment in the second quarter versus what you saw in Q1? And also, kind of what the expectation would be going forward?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure, Matt. Yeah, EIG add 2% organic growth in Q2, but that was really a situation of large job shipping or shifting to the right. The reason that I'm not worried about it because the organic growth of EIG was 8%. So, we're very bullish on the second half of the year of EIG and it really was just a one quarter issue and it really wasn't that bad. And again, with the 8% orders growth organically, it looks good for the second half.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Got it. And then with respect to maybe the linearity, maybe can you comment, the linearity you saw in organic orders in the quarter and whether or not the volatility we've seen in oil prices as of late has resulted in any volatility, I guess, in particular, in the EIG business? And then, if maybe you can just the close the loop on what the issue was in terms of what exactly moved out of Q2 into a later period? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The first point is, there's always jobs that move in and out. So, there wasn't one specific job. The orders for the quarter were generally increasing. They started April where we thought they would, and they increased and they were very strong in June. So, typical quarterly pattern, but it ended in a very strong June.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Got it. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yep.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning all.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Brett.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hey. So, we've heard a lot from the industrial peers around price/cost, it's been a little bit of a challenge in the quarter. Could you just talk about separately what price was? And any commodity input costs that are giving you some challenges here in Q2 or the back half?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure, Brett. Our price across the company was a little over 1 point in Q3, so that's a little over 1 point positive price. And total inflation across the company was about 1 point. So, we were a slight benefit to the P&L. And when we look out for the second half of the year, we expect similar environment. Inflation may pick up a bit, but we think we can get some more pricing also. So, because where we're at with our products, very differentiated in most of our businesses, we really don't see inflation moving through the channel yet. And I expect to maintain positive price/cost ratio throughout the year.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Great. And then you guys have maintained a view for flattish markets for the metal, and oil and gas businesses for the year. Any change to the guidance or expectation here? And I guess, how did orders specifically in these two businesses trend in Q2?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. That's a great question. Our EMIP business, as we went into the year, we called that flat and we mentioned in Q1 that sales were flat, but orders were slightly ahead of sales. And we continue to see improved end-market conditions with orders up sharply, and organic sales up mid-single digits in the quarter. So, if you look at EIG – EMG, had organic orders of 17%, and the EMIP business, the metals business, exceeded that rate. So, really, you've got a situation where the EMIP orders bounced back sharply. In terms of oil and gas, it was a similar story. We entered the year – we were pleased with our first quarter performance of flat sales. Orders were a little bit ahead. Our current forecast now is for oil and gas to be up low-single digits. We now expect upstream to be up high-single digits, and the mid and downstream business to be flat. So, we feel pretty good about both metals, and oil and gas, they were the two end-markets that caused us some headwinds. So, those headwinds are no longer there and we're performing very well, and we're very optimistic for the second half of the year.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And then, specific to the metals business, are you able to parse out what was price versus volume in the quarter?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: I think it was a couple of points of EMIP, which was related to metals inflation, if you will, and then the balance was underlying growth in the business.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Thanks for the color.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. You've actually got Sawyer Rice on here for Nigel. Just wondering if we could – you guys could help us think about the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar here. Just kind of what's the embedded FX in the top-line guide? And are you guys seeing any changes in the competitive environment globally due to the weaker dollar?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. It's a great question. We saw roughly 1 point of FX headwind to sales in Q2, which was similar to what we saw in Q1. With the dollar weakening a bit recently, we expect there to be no real FX impact in Q3 and likely a bit of a tailwind in Q4, if it stays as it is. So, for the full year, we expect a modest FX headwind turning around in Q4. And as we talked about the last year, when the dollar was strengthening – we're a big exporter from the U.S. We export about $1 billion. And with the currency weakening, with the dollar weakening, it's certainly going to improve our competitiveness. So, we're encouraged with that.
Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then maybe if I can just get a follow-up in here on M&A, wondering what the purchase price accounting impact was for the quarter and any way to kind of help us bridge core versus M&A impact on margins into the back half of the year here? Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. What I can tell you is that, as the – we already talked about the core operating income margins being up 30 bps, 22.7%. And if we look at the EIG and the EMG segments, the group level, the operating income on a core basis was up 50 bps and – for EIG, and it was up 60 bps for EMG. So, we had really good performance and we had some below-the-line G&A stuff and that included covering the one-time costs and the acquisition costs that we don't typically carve out. So, the underlying business is strong and what you saw was the reported operating margins of 21.8%, that included all that acquisition-related work.
Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): You know I'm going to ask my typical question about laying things out within the divisions, but I would also like to tack on to it, if I may, what was the sort of one-time isolated cost of the Executive Chairman charge? It looks like it was in corporate?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah, if you look at our G&A costs, we were up about $5 million over last year and about half of that was from the incentive comp that we talked about in past calls. We really had low incentive payouts in 2016 and now we're obviously performing much better. So, about half of that was the incentive comp and about half of it was related to the retirement of our Executive Chairman.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: And going around the business, I'll start with aerospace. Our overall aerospace sales were up low-single digits in the quarter. We saw a solid growth across each of our segments, including continued strong growth in our commercial OEM business. And we saw higher military sales in the quarter. We saw excellent order growth in the quarter driven by a number of large military projects that booked. They were, if you recall, talking about them in 2016, they were sliding to the right. Well, they actually booked in the first half of this year. As well as continuing solid commercial orders. So, for all of 2016, we continue to expect our aerospace business to be up low- to mid-single digits with growth expected to be across all of our each of our market segments. Our process businesses had a solid second quarter with overall sales up mid-teens and organic sales up low-single digits. Orders were also strong in the quarter with broad-based strength. Sales for our oil and gas businesses were up low-single digits in the quarter, continuing their positive sequential trends. We now expect low-single-digit growth for oil and gas for all of 2017. As a result of the solid orders, we now expect organic sales for the process businesses to be up low- to mid-single digits for the full year. Organic sales for our power and industrial businesses were up low-single digits in the quarter with similar levels of growth across both our power and industrial businesses. Given the strong order growth in the first half and improved heavy truck demand, we now expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up low- to mid-single digits for the full year. Organic sales for our differentiated EMG businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter with solid growth across all of our businesses. Our EMIP business continued to see improved end-market conditions. I mentioned previously, orders were up sharply and organic sales up mid-single digits in the quarter. And for all of 2017, we now expect organic sales for all of differentiated EMG to be up low- to mid-single digits versus 2016. And finally, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were up high-single digits in the second quarter as this business continues to perform very well. For 2017, we continue to expect sales for this business to be up low- to mid-single digits organically.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. You don't mind my sneaking one more in here.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Your third quarter organic sales guidance, I think you said low single digit?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes. That's correct. Q3 sales will be up about 10% and we have organic sales up low-single digits.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And when we compare that to the organic orders of the first half, which were up double digit, can you kind of connect those dots?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right, I'll connect those dots. The first point is Q4 will be a bit stronger than Q3, the way the backlog is playing out, and the orders were very strong, as your point, with broad-based improvement across all of our end markets. Many of our orders have multi-quarter or multi-year patterns as customers return to their normal ordering pattern. So, as an example of our EMIP business that we talked about, customers place blanket orders that typically ship over the course of the year. So, we're executing very well. We have a high degree of confidence in our outlook. We do feel good about how the year is playing out, but it's just the fact that the orders that are being placed are more in our mid- and long-cycle businesses, like our military business, like our metals, our EMIP business and those are more multi-quarter, multi-year ordering patterns.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks a lot.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Welcome.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Scott.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Pardon me, Bhupender, please check – okay.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Hey. Good morning, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hello, Bhupender.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Hey. So, my question is around MOCON, if you can just give us some color on how that acquisition is progressing, just give us some color on the sales and orders? And how much of, if any, accretion from that acquisition is going to contribute towards the guidance here in 2017?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, MOCON will be neutral to EPS in 2017. It's about a $70 million revenue deal. It's an outstanding company. MOCON has a very niche hedge position in gas analysis instrumentation. It's a leading brand, very strong technology intellectual property position, strong growth profile. It's been a mid-single-digit grower in a non-cyclical market. Solid aftermarket mix. So, it checks a lot of our boxes and we're very pleased with the acquisition. But again, it will be neutral to EPS in 2017.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Got it. And I just wanted to get a roundup on a geographical region...
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: ...Dave, usual. Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, the U.S. was up 1%, so it continued improving sequential trend. You recall, the Q3 2016, it was a negative double digits, and in Q4, it went to negative 2%. Q1, it was flat; and Q2 was plus 1%. So continue that sequential improvement in orders and sales. But the one thing that we're encouraged with, orders were very strong, in line with the overall company orders. So, we saw a significant change in orders in the U.S. Europe was up 6%, in line with recent trends, and it was broad based. Notable strength in our process businesses. Our Dunkermotoren business continued to perform very strong. The Middle East was very strong for us, and it resulted in a lot of strength in Europe, Asia performed very well, up 10%, driven by strength in our analytical instruments business. China was up 11%, so that's two quarters in a row where China has been very strong. Japan up 9%. India was up 40%. It's a smaller part of AMETEK, but very strong orders growth. So, really when you look across the globe, Bhupender, all regions were – all major regions were improving, and orders were ahead of sales. So, we feel good about that.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Got it. Thank you so much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Allison.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Could you talk a little bit about incrementals in the back half of 2017. If I remember correctly, the oil and gas and metals business typically carried higher incrementals. I mean should we assume that or is there some mix issues in the back half?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes, we have some mix issues that we talked about earlier in the year. But the EIG core margins up 50 bps and EMG core margins up 60 bps, we feel pretty good about the second half of the year. So, overall, for the business, we had incrementals of 30% in Q2, so about the same as Q1. And we said that we'd be up in incrementals from 20 bps to 60 bps for the year. So, we feel we're performing very well. We're getting the pull through on the incremental volume, and I would expect it to continue at the same level it is.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's great. And then, obviously, oil stabilizing sort of at $45, maybe $55 range. As you look at the sustainability of that business for you, are there any concerns, any sort of pullback that you're seeing in inquiries? Can you just talk about maybe customer dynamics sort of in this range, maybe for the next 12 months here?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, we feel really good about it. What we're seeing – we make manufactured capital equipment. So, there was some excess capacity in the market that needed to be utilized. But we're seeing increased activity. We're seeing it in the upstream market, as I said before, up high-single digits. We're seeing strong aftermarket MRO business across the globe. The mid and downstream market, we're calling that maybe down this year to flat. We're feeling more confident because we booked some significant project business in the Middle East. We had some businesses that were not penetrated in the Middle East. We made some investments and we booked some substantial project business. So, that project business kind of takes the risk off the table, from my viewpoint, for midstream and downstream for the balance of the year. So, we feel pretty good about it. We didn't get ahead ourself and we're still accelerating.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Perfect. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter and a good start to the year, although not entirely a surprise, I suppose. I guess, the first question I would have is, maybe you could just kind of give us the latest kind of state of your balance sheet, balance sheet capacity, complexion of deals you're looking at, size and scope, so we just have a good sense of kind of what your M&A firepower is over the next 12 to 24 months?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right, right. I think Bill might have mentioned before that when you take the cash and the existing credit facilities, there's about $1.5 billion of firepower there. But more importantly is the operating cash flow of the business. We're going to generate about $800 million of operating cash flow. It's a CapEx light or an asset light business model. So, we'll spend about 1.8% or 1.9% of sales, about $80 million, on CapEx. So, that leaves $720 million of free cash flow to deploy on acquisitions. And we've already deployed about $520 million on MOCON and Rauland. So, really not constrained with our current strategy with our balance sheet – a lot of optionality and a lot of firepower. You talked about the M&A pipeline. Our pipeline remains active. We're very excited about the quality and breadth of our deal pipeline. As we said before, we have a dedicated team of about 10 M&A professionals who work closely with our businesses to identify strategic acquisitions. We're in a lot of niche markets and this allows for a broad set of opportunities from which we can identify the best fit. So, it allows us to remain disciplined in our return metrics and we select the deals that we add the most synergy to. So, we have excellent capability in the deal sourcing and the whole M&A team from deal sourcing, deal modeling, diligence, integration, and very bullish on M&A and very bullish on the future for AMETEK.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And just a couple more. On the oil and gas exposure, could you just give us some sense of your business in terms of the sizing now? And then, specifically, just given the oil and gas swoon we've seen, how should we get concerned if we see oil pull back again versus maybe some structural or comp-aided led recovery here? Meaning, basically, could we be in a situation where you expect to see line of sight to low- to mid-single-digit growth well into 2018 despite what we could see in normal variations of the price of oil?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. We haven't talked about 2018 yet. But certainly, we've already booked some orders for 2018, those large projects in the Middle East that I talked about two quarters in a row. And we think the price of oil in that $45 to $50 range is fine. It allows us to – we have very differentiated products. We have a captive aftermarket. That aftermarket's about one-third of the business. The business is geographically dispersed, about one-third in the U.S., two-thirds international. And during the downturn, we continued to invest in our market position. So, we feel really good about it. We're not expecting it to turn into the gung ho times of the past. At that time, it was about $400 million in revenue for AMETEK, and now it's about $240 million in sales entering 2017. So, it's about 6% of the company; 20% upstream, 80% mid, downstream. So, 20% upstream, 80% in mid, downstream. And at the current price of oil, we're seeing increased activities. So, customers are talking to us about orders. They have capital spend. The authority to spend is back in the business units, instead of the C-suite. And we had some modest expectations coming into the year, and we feel solid that we're going to achieve them or beat them.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then just the last more of an editorial comment. I mean, have you looked at the potentially – a lot of your competitors have moved – or not competitors, but public comparables, I suppose, have moved to looking at kind of cash earnings, just given the nature of their business models and the compounding kind of the M&A business model, which is similar to yours, obviously. Have you looked at that? And just in the context of just your strong operating and free cash flow generation?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right, we do have tremendous free cash flow generation. And if we reported EBITDA, it would add 4 points or so to our earnings. But we haven't made a decision and we're not looking at changing right now. So, at this point, we figure you're smart enough to figure that out. And we have a GAAP quarter, GAAP 2018 – GAAP 2017 and versus GAAP in 2016. But we have noted that we are getting increased questions, but we really haven't looked at it in detail and we haven't made a decision to move to that, by any means.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Deane.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey. I've got question for Bill on the working capital improvement. Just – well, are you targeting a specific working capital sales? Where are the improvements coming from and how are you getting there?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're pleased with where we were at 17.9%. I think we've been as low in the past as in the mid- to low-17s. I think that'd be a good place for us to get to again and we're certainly working towards that. I think the area for greatest opportunity, and we did see improvement in that this quarter, is around inventories. But we continue to push on all facets, both receivables as well as payables in addition to inventory. But I think when you look at our company, inventories are the greatest area of opportunity, if you will.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then how about pension and you made the contribution last quarter, what's the status?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Plan is performing very well. We're about 110% funded domestically. Internationally, in the UK, we're a little bit underfunded, we're around about 90%. So, from that perspective, our plans are fully, on an overall basis, very, very well funded. Returns of the plan have been very good, this year's year-to-date, as you'd expect, given the state of markets around the world. So, we're very comfortable with our fundings around our pension plans and, at this point, wouldn't expect any further fundings other than the small numbers that need to go in on a regular basis into the UK plans, but nothing of significance.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a question about second half. As I look at your change in your organic top-line growth and I just look at the change in EPS, and if I just sort of base the calculation on incrementals for the second half, are there any headwinds in the second half – sort of I guess, it's the continuation of operating leverage question in the second half. But are there any issues related to M&A or one-time charges in the second half that we should consider thinking about EPS?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No, no, not really. When you look at the second half of the year, the simple economics are we raised our organic sales growth from low-single digits to low to mid-single digits. So, that's roughly on $60 million increase. And if we get a 30% pull through, that gives you about $18 million, and that's about $0.05 or $0.06. So, that's the economics of it, very simply. So...
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Right. And then I sort of took into consideration what you guys did this quarter, maybe I'm nit-picking, right.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. Yeah. And we do expect the organic growth for the second half of the year to be a lot like the first half with Q4 a bit stronger than Q3.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Got you. So, same math. Just a question on visibility. How much visibility do you have in China? You sort of highlighted strong orders there, but do you think you have visibility into next spring after this big party Congress that they're going to have?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, we haven't done any planning for 2018 yet. And we're still focused on 2017. And for 2017, we have solid visibility for the remainder of the year. China looks like it's going to be strong for us.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Terrific. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just one question on your aerospace business, more longer-term question. So, when you seeing Boeing starting to in-source and creating an avionics department, then how does that make you – how do you think about your existing business in light of that kind of trend and how does it make you – does it make you want to think about your positioning longer term differently than you would have a little while ago?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No. It doesn't. I mean, we're now placed on the value chain in the aerospace industry, where, from my view, it's the place to be. We're not at the system integrator level, selling to Boeing. We're down on the differentiated components. And typically, when we do some type of electronics, it's typically around our unique sensing technology, to put together a subsystem for a person that's a system integrator. So, the types of works that we have is driven by our sensor technology, which is proprietary, and also the projects that we get involved, I don't think that we have any effect with Boeing creating the avionics business unit. That may have a bigger effect upstream from us, at the system integrator level, but it won't affect our business.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just to kind of follow-on Andrew's question earlier on the guide. I know I'm probably beating a dead horse here a bit, but a $0.05 bump at the midpoint off of a $0.04 beat to your 2Q, plus with FX moving in your direction, just what are any like offsets that we needed to think of? Obviously, with the organic raise, and the FX, and the beat here, it sums to more than the magnitude of raise. So, what do you look at as the offsets there?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, the one offset will be the continuing compensation in the quarters that we've dealt with the first half of the year. But we're executing very well and we have a high degree of confidence in our outlook. And as you said, we did raise our guidance for $0.05 at the midpoint, and it was more than our beat for the quarter. So, there may be a bit of conservatism, but we feel very good about how the year's playing out.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And if I can just – on EMG, specifically, the incrementals there looked a little bit lighter just given the magnitude of the organic growth in quarter. Is there anything specific in the quarter that you'd point to there?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No, EMG's incrementals are a little bit lower than EIG's. So, there isn't anything that's notable there.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.

Ken H. Newman - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just wanted to see if you can give some color on your aftermarket-oriented businesses versus OE. Just curious if you're seeing normal (47:02) where the units are in their cycles?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right in the aerospace for our third-party MRO business, we expect solid low- to mid-single-digit growth for the year. Those businesses are very steady businesses. They're doing very well. And we've some niches that are less (47:23) right now. So, feel really good about that. And the balance of AMETEK, non-aerospace, we have largely proprietary aftermarkets tied to our spare parts and services of our equipment. So, that's a captive and it's growing very well.
Ken H. Newman - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: It's good color. Thanks for the time.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes our Q&A session for today. So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Coleman.

David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. AMETEK had an excellent first quarter. We delivered strong sales growth and solid operating results with earnings that were above our guidance range. We continue to generate strong levels of cash flow which we are successfully deploying on highly strategic acquisitions. We're also seeing the benefits of the ongoing growth investments we are making across our businesses and geographies. While these quarterly results reflect the benefits of a modestly improving macro environment, they also reflect the strength of AMETEK's business model and the execution of our growth strategies. Now on to the financial highlights for the quarter. Please note that any references on this call to full year 2016 financial results will be on an adjusted basis excluding the fourth quarter 2016 adjustments. Sales in the first quarter were $1.01 billion, up 7% versus the first quarter of 2016. Organic sales were up 4%. Acquisitions added 4% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter. We're very pleased that we've returned to positive organic growth one quarter earlier than we had anticipated. And we're equally encouraged by the broad based improvements in sales during the quarter. In addition to the strength in sales, we saw excellent growth in orders in the quarter with overall orders up 16% and organic orders up 9%. This order strength was also broad based. Operating income in the quarter was $220.3 million, up 6% from the same period in 2016 and operating income margin was 21.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60, an increase of 5% compared to last year's first quarter of $0.57 per share. Operating cash flow was excellent at $193 million, up 27% over the prior year excluding a pension contribution made in this year's first quarter. Now turning to the individual operating groups. Firstly, Electronic Instruments Group. Our Electronic Instruments Group performed very well in the first quarter with strong sales and operating performance. In the quarter, EIG reported sales of $619.8 million, up 9% compared to the same quarter in 2016. Organic sales were up 4%. Acquisitions contributed 6% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. Organic growth was fairly broad based with particular strength in many of our process and power businesses. Sales for oil and gas businesses were roughly flat in the quarter and in line with our expectations. Acquisition growth was also strong as a result of the five acquisitions we have completed within EIG over the last year, including Brookfield, ESP/SurgeX, Nu Instruments, HS Foils and Rauland-Borg. EIG operating income increased 10% to $156.7 million and our operating margins were a very strong 25.3%, up 40 basis points over last year's first quarter. The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $387.9 million, up 3% versus the first quarter of 2016 with organic sales up 4% versus the prior year. The acquisition of Laserage contributed 1% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind for the quarter. We saw solid growth across our Precision Motion Control and Floorcare and Specialty Motors businesses as well as stable conditions across our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging businesses in the quarter. EMG operating margins in the first quarter were $79.4 million with solid operating margins at 20.5%. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong sales, orders and operating results in the first quarter. In addition, we continue to be pleased with the success of our acquisition efforts. In February we acquired Rauland-Borg, one of the largest acquisitions. And in April, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire MOCON. I will provide a brief overview on each of these businesses. First, Rauland-Borg. Rauland is a leading global provider of mission critical clinical communications and workflow solutions to hospitals, healthcare systems and post-acute care facilities. Rauland also provides communication solutions to educational facilities. We see attractive incremental growth opportunities for Rauland by increasing their market share in international markets, expanding through additional acquisition opportunities, and through leveraging our operational excellence capabilities. Rauland adds approximately $160 million in sales. The purchase price was $340 million plus a potential contingent payment of $30 million tied to achievement of certain milestones. The integration is going very well and the Rauland team has hit the ground running and is delivering strong performance. We're very excited about the excellent growth opportunity Rauland provides AMETEK. On April 17, we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire all the outstanding common stock of MOCON, Inc. at a price of $30 per share. The aggregate enterprise value of the transaction is approximately $182 million. MOCON is a leading provider of laboratory and field gas analysis instrumentation to research laboratories, production facilities and quality control departments in food and beverage, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. This is an excellent acquisition for AMETEK as MOCON's products and technologies nicely complement our existing gas analysis instrumentation business. In addition, they provide us with opportunities to expand our gas analysis instrumentation presence in the growing food and pharmaceutical packaging test market where MOCON is the global leader. The company is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including the approval of MOCON shareholders and applicable regulatory approvals. We expect the transaction to close in the late second quarter or early third quarter. We are very excited about our recent acquisitions as they provide us the opportunity to expand our businesses into new adjacent market segments with strong growth characteristics. These acquisitions also provide us the opportunity to drive meaningful cost synergy through the integration into our global infrastructure and to our operational excellence program. Lastly, these acquisitions will provide us the opportunity to better target and service customers by leveraging products and technologies across all of AMETEK. One example of this sales leverage can be found in a recent $24 million multi-year contract award to AMETEK in support of a large automated test equipment program for a U.S. defense contractor. Two of our businesses, VTI Instruments which we acquired in 2014 and Programmable Power, successfully partnered to help win the award. Both businesses are part of our broader Power Systems and Instruments business and provide test and measurement solutions for a wide range of critical applications. One of the main drivers for the selection was the combined capability of VTI and Programmable Power. Along with this technical capability, the customer has the advantage of a streamlined interface for service, sales support and program management. This is a great example of the sales synergies we develop across our businesses through our acquisition integration process. We are seeing great results from our continued investments in research, development and engineering to support our differentiated products in the niche markets they serve. These RD&E investments play a key role enhancing organic growth. In 2017, we expect to increase our investments in RD&E to approximately $220 million or roughly 5% of sales. This is an increase of approximately 10% over 2016 RD&E spend levels. Our vitality index remained very strong at 23% of sales in the first quarter. One new product example this year is the Flex 4K-GS model high-speed camera from our Vision Research business. The high-speed 35-millimeter 9.4 megapixel camera employs a custom sensor capable of recording 1,000 frames per second at 4K resolution. This camera was designed for demanding application in the scientific research, defense and aerospace industries. The camera's design is critical to the defense industry as its isolated electronics and the thermal design allow the camera to operate in environments that range in temperature from minus 20 degrees C to plus 50 degrees C, all while maintaining excellent image quality. We are also seeing continued great results from the execution of a broad set of operational excellence initiatives. Through these OpEx initiatives, we expect to drive approximately $100 million in savings in 2017. Equally important to these savings is the positive impact these operational excellence tools have on our working capital and cash flow generation. We delivered excellent working capital and generated strong levels of cash flow in the first quarter. This strong cash flow provides us the opportunity to support growth investments back into our businesses while providing significant capital for us to deploy in our strategic acquisitions. In addition, we are making excellent progress on expanding and enhancing our operational excellence tools on the sales and marketing processes within our businesses to support improved organic growth. Now turning to the outlook for 2017. Please note that our guidance for 2017 does not include the pending MOCON acquisition. We view the first quarter's results as a positive sign that market conditions are improving and we are encouraged by the organic growth in sales and orders during the quarter. For all of 2017, we expect overall sales will be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2016 with organic sales up low-single digits. We have increased our earnings guidance range for 2017 to $2.40 to $2.48 per diluted share from our prior guidance of $2.34 to $2.46, an increase of $0.04 at the midpoint. Our current guidance range implies earnings growth of 4% to 8% over adjusted 2016 earnings. For the second quarter of 2017, we are expecting overall sales to be up mid-single digits with organic sales up low-single digits. We are anticipating second quarter diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. To summarize, we delivered a very strong quarter with a high quality of earnings and are well positioned for solid earnings growth in 2017. We continue managing our businesses prudently in the short term while also making appropriate investments to support long-term growth. Our talented and experienced management team will continue to leverage our growth strategies to drive growth across our businesses. The company's balance sheet is strong, supported by our outstanding cash flow generation. We will use this financial capacity to compound future performance through niche differentiated acquisitions which we can significantly improve. We are excited for the year ahead. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to thank all of our AMETEK employees for their continued exceptional work. We have a tremendously talented and dedicated team and greatly appreciate all their efforts in delivering strong results in the quarter while working to properly position AMETEK for a strong long-term growth. I will now turn it over to, Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, we had a very strong first quarter with results that exceeded our expectations. Let me provide some financial highlights. In the first quarter, organic selling expenses were up in line with organic sales growth. General and administrative expenses were up over last year's first quarter due largely to higher compensation expense. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 27.4% versus last year's first quarter rate of 26.7%, and in line with our expectations. For 2017, we expect our tax rate to be between 27% and 28%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.4% of sales in the quarter, down from 20.8% in last year's first quarter. Capital expenditures were $13 million for the quarter and we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $43 million in the quarter. For the full year 2017, depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $180 million. In the first quarter, we made a $50 million contribution to our U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans. Excluding this contribution, operating cash flow in the first quarter was excellent at $193 million, up 27% from the first quarter of 2016 and free cash flow was $179 million or 129% of net income. For the full year, excluding the $50 million pension contribution, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 125% of net income. The primary use of our excellent free cash flow was to support our acquisition strategy, and as Dave mentioned, we have been very active on this front. Following a strong year for acquisitions in 2016, we deployed $340 million on the acquisition of Rauland-Borg in the first quarter, and in April, we announced a merger agreement to acquire MOCON. Total debt at March 31 was $2.41 billion, up from $2.34 billion at December 31, 2016. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $570 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at March 31 of 35%. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1.6 billion of cash and existing credit lines to support our growth initiatives. In summary, we delivered excellent results in the first quarter with a high quality of earnings. We are well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and excellent cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great, thanks, Bill. Latoya, we'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. The first question comes from Bhupender Bohra of Jefferies. Your line is open.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Yes, just wanted to get a sense of, as you've kept your 2017 organic sales guidance up low single digits which is kind of unchanged, how are you thinking about your oil and gas and metals businesses here – the previous expectation was kind of flat for the year, any change to that guidance or expectation as we go into the remainder of the year? Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. The oil and gas market played out as expected. It was roughly flat in the first quarter. The interesting point and the positive point is orders inflected up mid-single digits. So while we were flat, our orders inflected up to mid-single digits and it was driven by upstream, and some of the project business in the Middle East. So we continue to expect roughly flat sales for oil and gas for the year. We really like the trends we're seeing, but we want to remain a bit conservative at this point. And we realize, we're about 20% exposed to the upstream and 80% to the mid and downstream. So we're expecting the mid and upstream – the mid and downstream to inflect up later in the year or next year. But we do see positive order results in the first quarter related to the project business in the Middle East. So it played out as expected and flat in the first quarter but were positive on the orders inflecting up to mid-single digits. The metals story is really pretty much the same, played out as expected in the first quarter. Like oil and gas, orders were up mid single-digits so that's positive. We continue to expect roughly flat sales for our EMIP business for the year, but we like the trends we're seeing, but we want to maintain a bit of conservatism at this point.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Got it.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Does that answer your question?
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Yes, you did. Just one more follow-up on here. If I'm looking at the PMI, the export indices, that's been pretty strong over the last few months here despite the strength in the U.S. dollar. Can you talk about like AMETEK's exports market like where are you seeing strength especially region-wise and maybe some color from product-wise perspective? Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, 52% of our sales are international and we saw strong international growth in the quarter. Europe was up 7% organically, so a definite improvement from the recent trends. The Process businesses and our Dunkermotoren business were particularly strong. And Asia was up double digits organically driven by strength in our analytical instruments businesses. China was up high-single digit in sales and Japan was also strong, was up 30% tied to the Japanese government fiscal year-end. So we saw really strong growth in Asia, strong growth in Europe. So we're seeing broad-based international growth.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And can you point to like what was the growth in the USA or North America?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes. Sure. In the U.S., we saw a continued improvement from prior quarters. You remember, we saw sequential improvement in the U.S., and in Q1, it was flat on sales. So U.S. was flat but the orders growth was solid in the U.S. It was up mid-single digits. So across the board in all geographies, recent trends in all regions were up and we feel really good about it.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Thanks a lot.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Summerville of Alembic Global. Your line is open.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Thanks, good morning. Just a question about mix. Can you talk about why, if I'm calculating it correctly, incremental margins on a 4% organic increase were only 19% in the quarter? I would imagine there are some acquisition-related items, whether it'd be inventory step-up for Rauland-Borg, some of the diligence costs for MOCON. So can you flesh that all out?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes, right, Matt. When you look at Q1, actually our operating income margins were up 20 basis points on a core basis and we had 40 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisitions. So actually, the year-over-year Q1 incrementals were a healthy 32%. So we feel real good about that.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Got it. And then you mentioned I think, Dave, in your prepared remarks, you anticipate yielding $100 million worth of cost savings this year. Can you maybe break that down into the various buckets to get you there and where you can see upside to that number as you progress throughout the remainder of the year? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. Yes. We're off to a good start in our cost savings, right on plan. $60 million of that cost savings comes from material cost reductions and $40 million comes from other than material cost reductions, and about $16 million of that comes from the realignment charges that we took in Q4. And we feel that we've got an excellent plan to take cost out of the business, to make the business more efficient, and we're right on plan on executing it.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Thanks, Dave.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Brett Linzey of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning everyone.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Just wanted to touch on price, cost. Could you maybe just talk about price specifically in the quarter and if you can maybe just separate the metals business versus some of the core industrial businesses? And then on the cost side, did you see any incentive comp accrual or anything moving against that in the quarter? And then what are the expectations for the full year?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes, great questions. We saw incentive comp accrual, our G&A was up a bit in the quarter. And you recall that in the last call, we highlighted low incentive comp payouts in 2016 related to our performance, and we reset that for the year's plan, but now we're a bit of ahead of our plan, so we have some additional headwinds there. So it was a $0.05 headwinds for the year prior to the quarter and now it's a bit more and you see that working through the G&A line with the increase in G&A vast majority was driven by compensation expense. And the other question was related to price. Price was about 1% in the quarter and that's across all of AMETEK and our total inflation was about 1%. So we offset total inflation with price, and for the year, we're expecting to increase the price a little bit. We have about 1.5 points of price in our plan, and we think inflation may increase a bit through the year, so we want to stay ahead of that but we're not seeing it right now. And in the first quarter, price was a point and it offset inflation.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. And then if we just aggregate the 2017 acquisitions you've made and as well as the 2016 deals with the stub contribution this year, what's the net EPS accretion you're assuming for this year? And then I guess as we look into 2018 and some of the one-time PPA dates (25:40) what's the run rate accretion for 2018 for the first full year?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, I think working in the number for 2017 is a $0.04 or $0.05 number. And in 2018, that'll be a bit more than that but we're not in 2018 yet.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, all right, great. Thanks, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Your line is open.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a strong start to the year.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Rob.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Maybe we can just first just talk about kind of the state of play of the balance sheet, the capital deployment environment. I mean there has been some articles that would suggest given kind of this looming kind of regulatory and political uncertainty that actually M&A's slowed. And obviously, valuations don't help that because valuations continue to go up and up. And in an uncertain environment, the bid-ask can be distorted. But could you talk about you think your ability over the next 12 to 18 months, 12 to 24 months to kind of live up to your potential in terms of capital deployment and then talk about some of the opportunities you see?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes. Our balance sheet remains strong. We currently have $1 billion plus in firepower after MOCON and the pipeline remains very strong and active. And as you know, with our niche strategy, we have a dedicated team of M&A and deal sourcing professionals who work closely with our businesses to manage and cultivate the deal pipeline. So, AMETEK we buy in up cycles, we buy in down cycles, we buy in uncertain environments and we're very active. And right now our pipeline remains very strong and like to deploy more capital this year. We got off to a great start with the Rauland deal. And MOCON, if that deal closes as we expect, we'll deploy $522 million in the first two quarters of the year, so we're well on our way in our plan of deploying our free cash flow on value-enhancing acquisitions.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And then as most people saw my work know that I just steal, so I'm going to steal Scott Graham's kind of state of the end markets and segments from him, all right, see he goes for that.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. I'll start with aerospace. Our overall aerospace sales were down slightly in the quarter as we had expected. Strength in our commercial OEM business and business and regional jet businesses were offset by lower sales in our military business due to the timing of program shipments. For all of 2017, we continue to expect overall aerospace business to be up low single to mid-single digits with growth across each of our segments. Moving to Process, our Process businesses performed very well in the quarter with strong sales and orders growth. Overall, sales were up mid-teens driven by mid-single-digit organic growth and the contributions from the acquisitions of Rauland-Borg and Nu Instruments. Both sales and orders growth in the quarter were broad-based across most of our Process businesses. Sales for our oil and gas business, as we already mentioned, were flat in the quarter with solid mid-single-digit orders growth. While we're encouraged by the solid growth in the quarter, we continue to expect organic sales for Process to be up low single digits for the full year. Moving to power and industrial, overall sales for our power and industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter, driven by contributions from the acquisitions of Brookfield Engineering, ESP/SurgeX and from low single-digit organic growth. Solid organic growth in our power business was offset by weaker conditions across our heavy truck business, and for all of 2017, we now expect organic sales for power and industrial to be up low single digits. Differentiated EMG businesses organic sales were up low single digits in the quarter, driven by solid growth in our Precision Motion Control business. Sales for our EMIP business, as we mentioned prior, were flat, but we had solid mid-single-digit order growth. For all of 2017, we continue to expect organic sales for all of differentiated EMG to be up low single digits versus 2016. And finally, our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business, organic sales in Floorcare and Specialty Motors were up mid-single digits in the quarter. And for 2017, we now expect sales for this business to be up low- to mid-single digits organically.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Rob.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi, this is Jeff Reive on for Deane Dray. I just had a question about your Rauland-Borg acquisition. I know it's still pretty early, but what kind of strides have been made for international growth? I know that was one of the big pieces behind adding value at AMETEK.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. We've made a lot of progress at Rauland in integrating the business into AMETEK. They came out of the gate strong, very active in the integration processes. We have teams working on international growth. We have some kaizen events scheduled later this quarter to get after some of it. So everything that we see there, we're more confident than ever that we're going to be able to increase international sales as part of our investment thesis in Rauland.
Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, that's great. And then just a quick update on just the trend of order flow. Can you just kind of discuss how it progressed through the quarter and now that we're into May, what the trend's been across AMETEK as a whole?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: In Q1, January started off much as we anticipated and then in February and March, it trended upward and it was stronger than we anticipated and it was broad-based, as I mentioned before. And we just finished April and April orders are right in line with what we thought we'd be to deliver our Q2 plan.
Jeffrey Reive - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. Great, thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning. The free cash flow guidance, 125% conversion excluding the contribution, that's a little bit of a higher conversion rate than you've guided in the past, particularly at this time of year. Just wondering what's behind that, if that's a timing thing for this year or if that's kind of the steady-state go forward after the past year or two of incremental deal flow?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, I think steady-state over multiple years, we'd still guide to 120% but you really have a couple of things. One, the working capital performance was absolutely outstanding in the business and our free cash flow conversion was nearly 130% in Q1. So with that, the confidence of that progress we were able to increase the 2017 expectations to 125% conversion. And again, the operations are executing perfectly. They're converting the orders of sales and they're executing on the working capital management, so we're really pleased with that.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just looking for a little disaggregation of orders in terms of by segment growth and the overall book-to-bill?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. EIG organic in Q1 was 10%. EMG organic in Q1 was 9% and Q1 book-to-bill was 1.11.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Allison.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Just want to get back to the orders. Just trying to reconcile and I understand you want to be conservative. Is there a timing in the orders? Are they more for the back half of the year? Do some of that gets pushed into 2018? Is there something that's giving you some concern on those trends that you didn't want to raise organic yet?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Great question. There are some of the orders that are multi-year orders. The $24 million order with a government defense contractor will ship in 2017 and 2018. So we have a little bit of that in the quarter. But fundamentally, we definitely performed better than we expected in Q1. We saw stronger sales, orders and earnings. We're very pleased with the performance and I'm confident for the rest of the year, but it was one good quarter. And remember, we're just coming out of a 2-year industrial recession. So it feels prudent to be a bit conservative at this point of the year just so we can make sure that our great start is sustainable and we don't get ahead of ourselves.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's great. And then just touching on incrementals, 32% in Q1, is that a sustainable level? Should we look to an inflect up towards the back half of the year? How should we think about those?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Great. We gave guidance that core incrementals would be up 20 basis points to 60 basis points for 2017. So we're still very comfortable with that range.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Scott Graham of BMO Capital. Your line is open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Rob, thank you for asking my question. One less thing to worry about. The two questions that I have are as you exited 2015, you were really on a bit of an acquisition tear, I guess a little bit like you maybe are now. But if my tally is correct, I think over a 4-year period, you added a substantial amount of new sales. And further, if my tally is correct, I think 40% of the company was kind of new at the end of, let's call it, 2015. And the businesses that you added were all slightly higher organic growth and AMETEK proper at the time of acquisitions. So that didn't really show up in the industrial recession, I think, very little for many companies showed up. But I guess my question is a sort of dovetail into what is now a 5% RD&E level. Are those expenditures going more toward those faster growth acquisitions to kind of reinvigorate them?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, you know the philosophy and the way we manage our business, the R&D investments are done by the business units and they'll flow up to the corporate office and we'll review them at our budgets and our strat plans and we do that quite often. And there's certainly a filter to apply those into the higher growth opportunities that we have. But in general, we've been a very consistent spender over many, many years and we plan to do that because we think it's key to our differentiation, it's key to keep our margins and we think we have excellent product portfolios, fresh updated product portfolios. And as we talked about earlier, our vitality index was very solid in the quarter. So the R&D investments are strong. We're going up 10% this year and I do think they're going to contribute to stronger organic growth.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So would it be appropriate to sort of paraphrase what you just said as saying that the faster growth acquisitions through the end of 2015 that they're not getting extra funds per se, but in fact, you expect those businesses to return to their prior growth rates naturally?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes. I believe that they will return to their natural growth rate as we exit the industrial recession. So I think what we saw in Q1, with the 4% organic growth, the 9% orders growth is a one thing that we can look at to get some confidence on that end. But yes, I'm really confident on our portfolio. I'm confident in the way we're managing our portfolio and we're focused on improving organic growth. As you know, we have an initiative to improve our organic growth, and part of that focus is to improve our customer-facing capability, really make it as strong as our operational capability. So we're rolling out best practices across the company. We're working on a lot of tools. So that, combined with our R&D investment is going to take some time, but gives me confidence that we have the potential to grow at an organic rate that's a point or two higher than we've grown in the past cycle.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got you. Thank you. Here's my follow-up, Dave. The power business is certainly one of your larger platforms now. Could you kind of unbundle for us how we did by business, let's say, generation versus T&D versus UPS?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. The UPS business is the biggest part of the business. It had strong orders growth globally. The test and measurement part of it is that had a substantial growth that we talked about because it was the business that booked the $24 million order that I mentioned. And our generation business was in line with what we expected it to be, so in this quarter, we saw solid results from our UPS business, our uninterruptible power business, but the outperformer in orders was really the test and measurement business.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Your T&D business was up as well or no?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, our T&D business was up, yes, but the power and industrial segment is the one of the places we raised the organic growth below single digits and it was because of the orders performance in Q1.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks very much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: You're welcome, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank America. Your line is open.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning Andrew.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Congratulation on a good quarter, returning back to growth.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a question. We've been getting a lot of questions from investors on aerospace. Wide body build is slowing and people are getting concerned maybe about narrow body. Could you just tell us, a, just to remind us what the exposure is in your commercial aerospace business; and what kind of visibility you guys have ahead and what are you seeing?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. I feel really good about our aerospace business and we've called that up low to mid-single digits for the year. If you remember, 35% of AMETEK's business is in the military market. So that's not really exposed to the wide body dynamic that's going on right now. And in the military market, we're quoting a lot of things and we have some program timing issues, because we're not sure when the U.S. government's going to spend money, but we think there's definitely more upside than downside on that part of aerospace. And we think that's going to definitely be up for the year. When you think about our commercial business, that's about 25% of our aerospace business, so military 35%; commercial 25%. About half of that is aftermarket, proprietary parts that we sell directly to airlines. And the other half of that is commercial OEM. Now the commercial OEM market is we're benefiting from the fact that over the past 10 years, we won substantial content on Airbus platforms. So with the A350, with the A320neo, those programs are allowing us to grow faster than the market and that's going to continue for a while. Then you go to the next segment. About 30% of aerospace is our third-party MRO business. That will be up mid-single digits for the year. Feel real good what's going on with that business, and the smallest part of our business, our business and regional jet market, that's about 10% of our aerospace exposure. That had a bad year last year. We were down substantially but we won some new programs and we had an uptick in Q1. So all of our aerospace segments we're saying are going to grow this year and we feel real good about that segment.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: This is very useful. And just on energy, you did highlight that things are getting better. Can you give us a little bit more color by region and also, if you have any view, if you're seeing any kinds of improvement in offshore?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. By region, we saw the North American MRO business strong and the upstream business strong. And the one thing that stood out for me in the quarter was the Middle East was also strong for our mid and downstream businesses. But as you know, this is a global business for us, about one-third of it in the U.S., two-thirds of it international. But those will be the things that stood out. North America for upstream, really MRO across the board and the strong performance in the Middle East where we made investments over the past couple of years and now we're benefiting from those investments.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just to follow-up. First, just follow-up on Middle East and my understanding is it's pretty much everything, Saudi's still maybe weak but everything outside of Saudi is getting better. Is that a fair description?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: We're seeing regions outside of Saudi getting better but some of our projects are within Saudi...
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Terrific. And then just a follow-up on – sorry for taking time, but just a follow-up on offshore, any signs of life there?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Quotations, we're quoting some things in the offshore market but that's more longer cycle.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Really appreciate the time. Thanks so much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Jim Foung of Gabelli & Company. Your line is open.
James V. Foung - Gabelli & Company: Hi. Good morning. Good quarter, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Jim.
James V. Foung - Gabelli & Company: Dave, maybe just talk a little bit about MOCON where you are in terms of meeting the regulatory issues and maybe could you just talk a little bit about on also the market opportunities, how big the market is for MOCON and the tangent markets you'd like to get into?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. We're very pleased to sign a definitive agreement to acquire MOCON. It's an outstanding company with an excellent management team and they have a very strong niche position in gas analysis instrumentation that serves the food, beverage and pharma market. The company is a leader in a couple of niches, the permeation testing niche and the food and pharma package testing. They have a strong growth profile with a mid-single-digit grower. It's typically been a non-cyclical market. There's a solid mix of aftermarket sales at about 35% of the business, diverse blue-chip customer base, smaller competitors. They're the leader in their niche markets. It's an ideal company that checks a lot of the acquisition criteria that we have, so we're very comfortable with the deal and it's going to be a win-win for both companies' shareholders. We signed the agreement on April 16. We expect to close in late Q2 and early Q3. And we'll need – the closing is conditional on MOCON shareholder approval and the antitrust approval. And all of the filings for those have occurred. So we're right on schedule there and we're very pleased and we think it's beneficial to both companies' shareholders.
James V. Foung - Gabelli & Company: Great. And then – I know you talked a little bit about Rauland-Borg a little bit and I know you have some growth opportunities there. Will we see more costs first as you embark on the growth opportunity before we see the benefits from those initiatives?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I think our operational excellence will certainly occur soon in regard to Rauland. We're already working on that. And we saw that with the family-owned business, they weren't really focused on acquisitions and international expansion. So we've already started a deal pipeline for Rauland, and with international expansion that's going to take some time. So you could see a scenario we get the benefits from OpEx initially. We get the growing international business and then we can fill in what Rauland needs with some acquisitions. So it's a lot of value enhancer for AMETEK and we're very, very pleased to own the business. The team hit the ground running and we're very pleased with the performance of the team.
James V. Foung - Gabelli & Company: Terrific, great. Thanks a lot. That's all I have.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Jim.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is open.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask quick. I mean you mentioned heavy truck earlier still weak. Are you seeing any inflection in your businesses, the data from some of those markets are starting to look decently better?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes. Heavy trucks is a small part of our power and industrial business. It's only about 2% of AMETEK. And we went into the year with a pretty negative view on the market and we were down in sales in Q1, but the recent data shows the heavy truck market inflecting up in what was a substantial decline in the market. Now the market is predicting an order rate that's closer to flat or down just a bit. So we're optimistic that that's going to be better than as we have planned, but we're keeping our current thoughts on the market or forecast for the market unchanged.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: And then when I look at your total, your organic outlook and your cost-out outlook, it just feels like the guide is – is it fair to say it's pretty modest in light of what you're seeing incrementally better on the top line and on orders in $100 million in cost out, is that a fair assessment?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I wouldn't say it's modest. It's a bit conservative but there's some – we have to execute to make those numbers. We're coming out of a two-year industrial recession. You've got to make that $100 million in cost outs happen. We're good at that, but they've got to happen. We had one quarter of organic growth. So we're pleased with stronger sales, orders and EPS and we're a bit conservative. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but we have to work to get the number.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: I feel like one of the things that people are a bit maybe, and this is not an AMETEK-specific thing, you mentioned core incrementals are about 30%, which is nice. I think some are concerned that a lot of the cost-out measures we've seen companies take over the last couple of years may lead to some costs having to come back as you start to see volume, so maybe a little bit less fixed cost takeout than people initially thought. How would you respond to something like that?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I think we're going to get core incremental growth and we're also going to invest in our businesses for the long term. And I think the AMETEK model of our strong operational excellence capabilities and our pricing power allows us to do both. So I really don't see a lack of cost reduction opportunities and I see us being able to execute our cost reduction while also investing in our business and growing. So I don't really see a situation where we have to put a bunch of costs back into the business to execute the plan. I mean we've already communicated that we have a healthy investment level this year, $65 million in growth investments. So we're doing the right things for these businesses in the long term, but the cost out in our model is something that's built into our culture. It's built into our strong operating managers and I don't – I see that going on for some time.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Yes. Good morning. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Morning.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Just a quick question, Dave. When I look at the second quarter guide, just kind of back to the incrementals here, the second quarter guide kind of implies zero incremental and I know it's kind of at the corporate average EBIT. And is that – are we picking up there maybe conservatism on the sales side, not driving a lot of EPS?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I think when you look at Q2, the one thing that stood out to me, a lot of the growth is coming from acquisitions. So we had Rauland for seven weeks in Q1. You have a full quarter of Rauland. And if you look at from Q1 to Q2, the core sales, they're roughly flattish. And we had a little bit of more difficult organic growth comp in Q2 that weren't good last year, but it was a little bit better in Q2 than Q1. So it's a bit conservative, but when you work through the numbers, it's a good number.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then also, I may not have caught this correctly, but did you mention that the cost-driven motors business in EMG now look like it might be up low-single digits? Is that...?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I did. We changed that to be up low to mid single-digits organically, so that was a change from the prior guidance and that business is just performing well. And we had a good first quarter so that was prudent to take that one up because we have very strong backlog and visibility.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.: And any big share gain there, or just large order, anything that gives you that visibility? Because that business can be a little tough to predict as the year goes on.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. It can be tough to predict and we've done a good job of migrating to better opportunities and we have a solid backlog.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin Coleman for closing remarks.

David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. AMETEK had a solid fourth quarter. We delivered results that were in line with our expectations with strong operating performance. Following a challenging start to 2016 that included difficult market conditions, we were able to deliver solid results in the second half of the year that were consistent with our guidance and expectations. As expected, market conditions stabilized in the fourth quarter and recent quarter trends reflect this stabilization. We are encouraged with these trends. I am also encouraged by our continued acquisition activity as we announced the acquisition of Rauland-Borg this morning. We are very excited to be acquiring Rauland-Borg given their strong niche position within the healthcare market and the outstanding leadership team that is joining AMETEK. I will provide more background on this acquisition in a moment. But, first, let me provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Please note that any references on this call to 2016 or 2015 financial results will be on an adjusted basis. I will discuss the fourth quarter 2016 charges in a moment. Sales were in line with our expectations in the fourth quarter at $973 million, down 1.5% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Organic sales were down 3.5%, acquisitions at 3% (03:00) and foreign currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter. Overall orders in the fourth quarter were up 1% and organic orders were down 1%, continuing an improving trend in organic orders for 2016. Operating income in the quarter was $212.7 million, and operating income margin was 21.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.58, down 8% over the last year's fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was excellent at $247 million in the quarter, up 24% over the prior year. This was a record level of operating cash flow, and it speaks to the strong operating performance across the company. For the full year 2016, sales were $3.8 billion, down 3% versus 2015. Operating income was $841.4 million and full year operating margins were 21.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $2.30, down 10% versus 2015. Now, turning to the individual operating groups; first, the Electronic Instruments Group. For the quarter, EIG reported sales of $616 million, down 2% versus last year's fourth quarter and in line with our expectations. Organic sales were down 6%, acquisitions contributed 5% and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. The solid acquisition growth was driven by the contributions of Brookfield, ESP/SurgeX, Nu Instruments, and HS Foils. We are seeing solid results from these acquisitions as the teams have done a great job integrating these businesses into AMETEK. The organic sales decline in EIG was driven in large part by the weakness across our oil and gas markets. Although, our oil and gas organic sales were down in the quarter, the year-over-year decline has moderated as conditions stabilized. We expect conditions to remain largely stable across our oil and gas businesses in 2017. EIG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $162.6 million and operating margins were a very strong 26.4%. The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $356.9 million, down 1% versus the fourth quarter of 2015 with organic sales roughly flat versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 1% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind for the quarter. We are seeing improved organic growth trends and good order input for these businesses. EMG operating income in the fourth quarter was $63 million with operating margins of 17.7%. In order to better align and reposition our cost structure to support sustained sales and earnings growth, we have taken realignment actions in the fourth quarter. These realignment actions totaled approximately $25.6 million. We expect a strong payback on these actions with annualized savings of $37 million with an approximate $16 million benefit in 2017. We also took a $13.9 million non-cash charge in the fourth quarter related to the impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles. This was not a write-off of goodwill, but was driven by the weak global macro environment and its impact on the value of certain product line, trademark and trade names. Combined, the total charge taken in the fourth quarter was $39.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Now, let me touch on some of the highlights from our growth strategies. Our four growth strategies of strategic acquisitions, new product development, global market expansion, and operational excellence have been and will be the key drivers of our success. They're well engrained in our business and culture. We view these growth strategies as critical to long-term success of AMETEK. First, let me touch on acquisitions. We are very excited with the acquisition of Rauland-Borg. It's a great start to 2017 as we acquired an outstanding company with a strong leadership position in an attractive niche market. I would like to welcome the Rauland-Borg team to the AMETEK family. Rauland is a leading global provider of mission-critical clinical communications and workflow solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, and post-acute care facilities. In addition to their presence in the healthcare space, Rauland provides communication solutions to educational facilities. They're a global leader with a premier brand name and a strong presence in their markets. We expect continued strong growth for Rauland as the healthcare space continues its shift to value-based care and patient outcome improvement initiatives, both of which are key elements of Rauland-Borg's value proposition to their customers. We see attractive incremental growth opportunities by increasing its market share in international markets, expanding through additional acquisition opportunities and through leveraging our operational excellence capabilities. Rauland was privately held with a distinguished 88-year history. They're headquartered in Mount Prospect, Illinois. Rauland has approximately $160 million in sales. The purchase price is $340 million plus a potential contingent payment of $30 million tied to achievement of certain milestones. This acquisition is an excellent example of our strategy to expand our footprint into attractive adjacent market segments. Rauland provides us the opportunity to expand our medical technology exposure into a strong growth segment, while expanding our broad exposure to the medical market. With the acquisition of Rauland, the overall medical market exposure for AMETEK is roughly 13% of sales. Over the last 12 months, we have deployed approximately $730 million in capital on six acquisitions and we acquired approximately $300 million in sales. We remain bullish on our acquisition pipeline and are excited to continue adding shareholder value through our proven acquisition capabilities. Now, turning to new product development; we remain focused on investing in research, development and engineering in order to support the strong product and technology differentiation across our business. Additionally, we look to RD&E efforts as a key element in our organic growth initiative. In 2016, we spent roughly $200 million on RD&E or 5% of sales. In 2017, we expect to increase our investments in RD&E to approximately $215 million. I'd like to highlight two of our recent new product introductions. First, AMETEK Rotron recently introduced their SemiCool Precision Fans and Custom Cooling Systems for the high reliability cooling of semiconductor processes. The SemiCool system offers precise temperature control in a compact package. It was originally designed for critical military and aerospace applications, and has been expanded to serve critical semiconductor manufacturing processes. The system consists of compact, high reliability fans and optimized heat exchangers. It is designed to meet the needs of heat-intensive processes in the semiconductor production and is a departure from the tall industrial blowers, commonly used in semiconductor facilities. The SemiCool system is compliant with semiconductor industry traceability and configuration control requirements. AMETEK Programmable Power, a leader in programmable AC and DC power test solutions, introduced the new DC power supply for Sorensen family of DC power supplies. The new Sorensen HPX series offers state-of-the-art features and technology in a smaller footprint than comparable DC power supplies. It delivers unsurpassed performance along with fast precise programmability. AMETEK Programmable Power are used for the design, verification, testing, quality assurance and regulatory compliance of electrical and electronic products by customers in the computer, consumer electronics, industrial controls and aerospace and defense industries. These are just two recent examples of the success of our research and development efforts. One way in which we measure the success of our RD&E efforts is through our vitality index. Our vitality index reflects the revenue from products introduced over the last three years. In 2016, our vitality index was 24%, up slightly compared to 2015. Operational excellence continues to be an important driver of our success given its focus on cost and asset management, as well as its focus on process improvements impacting all areas of our business. Our teams are making outstanding strides utilizing our expanded operational excellence tool kit to drive continued operating improvements in their businesses. In 2016, we generated $130 million in our total operational excellence savings. Our operational excellence activities include lean manufacturing, global sourcing, strategic procurement, value analysis, and value engineering, designed for Six Sigma and strategic cost effective manufacturing initiatives. Additionally, our activities include various tools that are focused on the frontend of our businesses to support improved organic growth. We are continuing to expand our average in this area across all of our businesses, which we believe will yield improved long-term organic growth. Now turning to our outlook for 2017. Market conditions are improved from this time last year. The most challenging markets from 2016 have stabilized. We are realigning our cost structure, while continuing to invest appropriately in important growth areas. Our operational capabilities and cash flow generation remain unquestioned and we continue to identify and close attractive acquisition opportunities. Although we will be appropriately cautious as we start the year, we're excited to return to sales and earnings growth in 2017. As a result, we are anticipating overall sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2016. Organic sales are expected to be up low-single digits from 2016. Earnings for 2017 are expected to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.46 per diluted share, up 2% to 7% over 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, we are expecting overall sales to be roughly flat, with organic sales down low-single digits. We are expecting first quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.57, flat to down 4% from 2016's first quarter. In summary, we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, and our business is stabilizing. We continued to aggressively manage our business for success in the short-term, while ensuring we are investing appropriately for the long-term. Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. We have a talented and experienced management team, and we see tremendous opportunity to drive improved performance through the expansion of our operational excellence tools. I am excited for the future of AMETEK and believe we are well-positioned to drive strong growth. We asked a lot of our teams in 2016, and as usual, they stepped up and delivered. I want to recognize the efforts of all our employees and thank them for their hard work. I'll now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details for the quarter and the year, and then, we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, we had a solid fourth quarter with results in line with our expectations. I'll now provide some financial highlights. In the fourth quarter, organic selling expenses were essentially flat versus the prior year. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales in the quarter, slightly above last year's fourth quarter level of 1.2% of sales. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 27.1% versus last year's fourth quarter adjusted rate of 26.0%. For 2017, we expect our tax rate to be between 27% and 28%. As we've said in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was very strong in the fourth quarter at 18.4% of sales, down from 20.8% in the third quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our team in this area. Capital expenditures were $23 million for the quarter and $63 million for the full year. 2017, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $57 million for the quarter and $180 million for the full year. We expect a similar level of depreciation and amortization, $180 million, for the full year of 2017. Our cash flow was outstanding in the quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was a record at $247 million, up 24% from the fourth quarter of 2015. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was $225 million, up 28% over the fourth quarter of 2015. Looking forward, for 2017, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income. The primary use of our strong free cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In 2016, we deployed approximately $390 million on acquisitions. And thus far in 2017, we have deployed $340 million on the acquisition of Rauland-Borg. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of our stock for $100 million. At year end, our remaining share repurchase authorization was $376 million. Total debt was $2.34 billion at December 31, up from $1.94 billion at the end of 2015. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $717 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at December 31 of 33%. These amounts reflect the private placement agreement we entered into on October 31 to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes denominated in euros and sterling at a weighted average interest rate of 1.82%, with an 11.5 year average maturity. The proceeds of the debt offering were used to pay down our revolver balance and to repay an existing British pound note. Overall, the private placement offering provides us with a larger financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. After the acquisition of Rauland-Borg, we have approximately $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter. We are excited as we look ahead to 2017 given our proven growth strategies and the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows to support these growth initiatives. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Bill. Brandy, we'd like to open it up for questions now.
Operator: Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi. Good morning, all.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah. I thought I'd start with the market commentary, and specifically your mention of stabilization in the businesses. I know, historically, you've pointed to some different shorter cycle or quick shift businesses that are really a guide post for those cycle turns. I mean, could you just talk about orders in some of those proxy businesses? And may be just the trend as you move through the quarter and into January?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The stabilization comment was really related to 2016. And we had real weakness in our oil and gas and our metals business. And as we spoke to in the last couple of quarters, we saw them stabilizing, and is charting out just as we had predicted. So, we're feeling, this time last year, we're feeling a lot of uncertainty about those two markets. But we're feeling significantly different this year. We're feeling more positive, because we think our footing is on a solid ground, and those businesses sequentially have stabilized. We also feel good about the continuing organic orders growth in the business. I mean, when you look at the organic orders, they've slowly improved each quarter throughout 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2016 our organic orders were minus 1%, and our total orders was plus 1%. So we're feeling really good about that also. So those are a couple of factors looking at orders and looking at our markets that make us feel much more positive going into 2017 than we were going into 2016.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. And then, if I could just shift back to the Rauland deal. Could you just talk about the competitive standing in those served markets? And then, it seems like somewhat of a new adjacency for AMETEK, I mean, obviously it is an expansion of sort of the medical play. But could you just give us any color on strategic fit as well as profitability or return economics for the deal you announced this morning?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. We think we have a solid return for the deal. We're very excited to acquire Rauland, as I mentioned. The market has strong growth characteristics. It's a mid to high single-digit grower. It's a regulatory driven market. But it's also benefiting from some demographics in an aging population and a perpetual shortage of nurses. So they have some great demographics driving our business. There is high barriers to entry. There is high switching cost. Key driver is value based healthcare. Rauland products help their customers reduce cost and improve nurse productivity and efficiency, that's the core product offering they have. They're a leading provider of mission-critical communication systems. Their product mix is about 80% hardware, 20% software. Their primary product in healthcare is called the Responder series. It has extremely high market share in the United States in a good product cycle. It's really a good product cycle in terms of the new business and also the retrofit business they can win. They are a leader in the niche. Their competition is companies like Ascom, but that's mainly international. They are a strong leader in the U.S. market. When we think about the company, we think we can help them grow internationally. They have about 10% of their sales outside the U.S. and there is also some acquisitions that they wanted to acquire. And being privately owned by a family, they really didn't want to have that risk tolerance. So we think it's a great opportunity for AMETEK to fund the business to grow internationally and also look into additional acquisitions. So, we did a lot of market work on the business and the market study that came back for this business has some of the highest scores that we ever saw on customer satisfaction. So the people do a great job around our businesses and we think that we can add a lot of value to it and it will be a great deal for our shareholders.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: That's good color. And anything you could provide on profitability maybe relative to the corporate structure of AMETEK today?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. It's less profitable to AMETEK obviously. It will be a – a mid-teens EBIT kind of number would be a good number to look at.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, gents.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hello, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. So, David, you mentioned oil and gas stabilized. So, does your outlook for 2017 – does that bake in a flat outlook for your oil and gas process markets in general?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, it really does. There is a – we expect 2017 sales will be flattish, but we think the upstream business will be up a little bit, and the mid and downstream businesses will be down slightly to flat. So we expect a little bit of sales improvement throughout the year. It's similar to when we went in for the oil and gas downturn, the upstream goes down first. While we are coming out of it, the upstream is starting to pick up. But we'll expect the midstream and downstream markets to improve later in the year, and maybe even next year. So it will be flat to down slightly for mid and downstream and up for the upstream.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the 1Q guides, I'm sorry if I missed this, what organic sales estimate are you assuming for 1Q, and any commentary on January trends would be helpful, too?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. January came in, in line with what we thought and organic growth for Q1 is down low single digits. We're feeling better, but we're really calling a transition from negative organic growth to positive organic growth. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, and we think the trend will improve for the year. But Q1 is down low single digits.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just one more. Can you make just a comment on EMG margins. They are a bit, little bit lighter than what we are looking for (26:26)?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, sure. EIG had a great quarter, and EMG was down a bit, and the EMG margins were driven by mix in our EMIP business. That business has a little higher fixed cost than the average AMETEK. So when the orders are lower, they are going to – margins are going to drop a bit. But the positive thing is we saw positive orders growth. Actually, EMG orders turned positive in Q4, and when you look at sequentially from Q4 to Q3, we had 50% contribution on the incremental volume. So we had a great quarter. EIG did a little better, and EMG did a little worse.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Dean.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, just to follow-up on the Rauland acquisition, just a couple of data points. How much is aftermarket as is typical in the mix? And then, are there any concerns with the Affordable Care Act, and how some of the funding for products and services like Rauland that might be impacted?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, great question, Dean. About 10% to 20% of the business was aftermarket, and the aftermarket is evolving because software is becoming a more important product offering for the business and software upgrades will increase that in the future. The repeal of the ACA, we did a lot of work on that and it really in the middle and long-term does not impact the value proposition of Rauland. They are strong demand drivers and minimum risk in the near-term. The fundamental issue is that, they help nurses work more efficiently. They're in a sweet spot of driving value-based healthcare and we got very comfortable with it. However, we had the same concern, and we were concerned that the potential market uncertainly could cause some spending delays in the near-term, that the market pause with all the changes. So we expect it to be minimal, but to be prudent, we structured the deal as an earn out, tied to revenue levels within the first two years. So we feel we acquired an excellent business and we have protected – we've added a degree of protection to our shareholders and we feel confident that we will earn our return on capital in both outcomes, either outcome. But we think we're going to pay the earn out, and we think that business is going to perform.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Is that earn out – is that a year from now where that gets trued up?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. It's a couple of years and it's tied to revenue.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And I was on the website this morning. It's real helpful. Did you say what that split was between healthcare and education markets?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The healthcare part was 90% and the education market is 10%. The education market is growing quite nicely. They have a new product called the Telecenter U and it's really involved in mission-critical communication. So, along with connecting classrooms and facilities across school districts, it also managed emergency communications for school districts, so it's seeing a good demand in the current environment.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And then just on the quarter, and I might have missed this, but what's the – how did it play out in terms of typical seasonality for typical fourth quarter? Did you see any budget flush? Did you see any kind of year-end ordering? How did that play out this quarter?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: When we were in Q3, we had a bit of a ramp projected for Q4 and we talked about we see some kind of year-end spending, little bit less than typical we expected it to occur and it occurred just like we thought. So, there's a little bit of year-end money returning to more typical patterns, but not like it was a few years ago.
Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a question on free cash flow. What do you think is the good run rate for AMETEK in terms of free cash flow conversion to net income going forward?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I think in the 115% to 120% on a go-forward basis is a reasonable place for AMETEK to be.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got you. And can you just talk about M&A environment after the election? How does tax uncertainty and deductibility of interest, and but probably more regulatory visibility interplay when you talk to people?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: It really hasn't affected our business that much. I mean, our acquisition pipeline is strong. We mentioned, with the Rauland deal, we had some additional market work to do there, but for most of our businesses, it seems that our pipeline work is going strong and there are ample people trying to sell the business, and ample buyers. So the market is still running at elevated pricing. It is still more money chasing deals, and we haven't seen any change in that in the last day since the election.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And if I could just squeeze one more in. On your oil and gas upstream business, how much of it is domestic versus international?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: About one-third is domestic, and two-thirds is international.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And what's the region, is it Middle East?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: It's distributed throughout the globe, but the Middle East is a strong area for us.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I think I'll just go ahead and steal Scott Graham's question, and just do the state of the organic growth on the orders. Sorry, Scott. So, if you just could go around and do that?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: So you want me to go around the sub segments.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, that would be great.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I'll start with the aerospace. The overall sales for our aerospace business were down mid single-digits in the quarter. Fourth quarter results were similar to the full year of solid organic growth across our commercial business was more than offset by continued weak markets in business jet and regional jets. Looking ahead to 2017, we expect our aerospace business to be up organically low single-digits to mid single-digits with growth across each of our aerospace segments. Our Process segment, organic sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven largely by our oil and gas businesses, we talked about that. As expected, conditions stabilized in the quarter. Our Ultra Precision Technology business had another very solid quarter to cap an excellent year with notably strong growth in both our Creaform and TMC Precitech businesses. We are encouraged with the stabilization we're seeing on the Process segment and expect this will continue into 2017. And for all of 2017, we expect organic sales for our process businesses to be up low single-digits with organic growth for our oil and gas businesses roughly flat. In our Power and Industrial segment, overall sales were up 10%, driven by the contribution of the Brookfield Engineering acquisition. Organic sales were down mid single-digits in the quarter and in line with expectations. The weakness was largely a result of softness in the heavy truck market. Switching to 2017, we expect organic sales for Power and Industrial to be roughly flat with modest growth in Power offset by weakness in our Industrial. In our differentiated EMG businesses, they were down low single-digits in the quarter, with weakness driven by our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses. As expected, conditions have stabilized across our EMIP businesses. And for 2017, we expect organic growth for all of differentiated EMG to be up low-single digits versus 2016, with our EMIP business expected to be flat. And finally, our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business, organic sales in our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business were up 10% in the quarter and we expect sales for this business to be down low-single digits organically. So, to summarize, for the full year, we expect overall AMETEK sales to be up mid-single digits and for organic sales to be up low single digits. For EIG, we expect overall sales to be up mid-single digits and organic sales to be up low-single digits. And for EMG, we expect overall sales to be up low-single digits and organic sales to be up low-single digits.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks very much for that. As a follow-up, maybe – and you might have spoken to this before either in your prepared remarks or questioning and I might have missed it, so I do apologize. But, have you talked about the EPS accretion for 2017 and 2018 for the existing deal? And then could you just give us an update of your M&A balance sheet firepower capacity, now that this deal has been closed?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Now that the deal is closed, we have about $1.5 billion in firepower. So we're very active and we'd like to do more deals and use some of that capacity this year. In terms of the Rauland deal impact on 2017, I think what you'll see, when you buy a business, there's a lot of accounting and one-time things that go on and you'll see some benefit in the second half of the year, not much benefit in the first half of the year, and you put that benefit in the $0.03, $0.04 range in the second half.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: $0.03, $0.04, so embedded in your guidance this year is probably $0.03 to $0.04 of earnings accretion from this deal?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Good morning. Just – kind of a follow up to the oil and gas and specialty metals business. Can you remind us sort of if we call 2014, 2015 the peak and we call 2016 kind of the trough, how much revenue have you lost in both of those businesses? Try and size that up for me a bit?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. So if you go back to the peak on oil and gas, there was about $400 million in revenue and entering 2017, it will be about $240 million in revenue, so we lost $160 million in revenue. So it was down about 40% from the peak. The upstream was down about 70%, and the midstream and downstream was down about 23%, 24%. And if you look at the EMIP business in metals, at the peak that business was about $500 million and we lost about 25% or $125 million, so that's about $375 million now going into 2017.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Got it. Thank you. And then, just with respect to the aerospace side of the business, can you provide a little bit more granularity around kind of what transpired in 2016 and what the expectations are for 2017 with large commercial being a bucket business regional and then military, and maybe if you can just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the aftermarket side, including third-party MRO that would be helpful? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. As I said, we're expecting low to mid-single digit for our aerospace segment in 2017. When you think about the commercial market, we expect that to continue strong. I think Boeing and Airbus are projected to increase build rates this year in the low-to-mid single-digit range and we have new additional content that we want on aircraft. So we expect to be up mid-single digits due to the ramp in new aircraft in the commercial area. In regard to the third-party MRO business, we expect to be up mid-single digits, just grow solid growth as revenue passenger miles expand and we're well positioned in a couple of niche areas to grow our services. The military market, which is about 35% of our total aerospace exposure, we expect that to be up low-single digits in 2017. And in 2016, there was – we had some – we were down mid-single digits and we expect that can be positive for us going up low-single digits in 2017. And in terms of the Bizjet market, that's a smaller part of our aerospace business. We expect modest sales growth off of a reduced sales level and the market we're expecting to be flat, but we do have some new program wins driving the growth.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Great. Thanks, Dave.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Rick.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Dave and maybe Bill, I wanted to just maybe explore, if I look at the guidance for 2017 from an EPS perspective and walk up to P&L, it looks like the incremental margin assumption for 2017 is something on the order of 0% to maybe 18% at the EBIT line and that's kind of adjusted. And I am curious, there is – it looks like maybe your RD&E is going up. There should, however, maybe be some restructuring save in there, and also – is there any – what are you kind of bearing in the numbers for operational excellence costs? And maybe can you just kind of walk me to the incremental margin assumption that underlies your EPS guide?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. I'll try to do that. I mean, first of all, OpEx, we have about $100 million of OpEx working in the numbers. As I said before, we got some acquisition growth, about $0.03 or $0.04, total acquisition growth. RD&E is up about 5% – 7% to $215 million. We do have some discrete incremental headwinds. FX will be about a point of sales and capital (41:56) $0.03 is the headwind.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Tax and interest will be about a $0.05 of headwind.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: The other thing is we have some incentive comp resets. So we're down substantially off our targets, and (42:12) next year.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: When you think about pricing, we were about 1% in 2016. We think it will be a slightly better pricing environment at maybe 1.5% range, but inflation will also be slightly higher. So we have price less inflation only slightly bother the 2016. Our CapEx is budgeted to be $75 million.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Cash flow will be 115% of net income. Our core operating margins for 2017 are expected to be up 20 basis point to 60 basis point.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. 20 basis point to 60 basis point.
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Can you touch on the growth investments, Dave?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The growth...
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: We have growth investments in sales, marketing and engineering and that's offsetting some of the savings you'd see from our typical material sourcing efforts as well as other cost reductions, which would include the realignment activities that Dave talked about earlier.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The growth investments will be about $65 million on incremental sales, marketing and engineering.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just what is the procurement – operational excellence procurement and sourcing savings that you're targeting out of the blocks for...?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: It was $130 million in 2016 and out of the blocks, we're saying it will be $100 million in 2017.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So down, okay, I get you. And then just one last question. You did give a little bit of a description around the metals businesses and we enter a $375 million of revenue and I am curious what was the – is that kind of captured in the EMIP growth rate? Are you expecting the $375 million to be flattish and then...
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then what does the margin look like there? I mean, we've talked about that being a pass through contribution. We are seeing metals prices starting to ratchet up a little bit. I mean, is flat revenue associated with maybe a lower margin relative to where metals prices are going in 2017?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The EMIP business is about at the AMETEK average profitability. And in terms of metals prices, I think it's a little bit of a mix for the key commodity trends for our business – for our business, vanadium is a key metal, that's plus 30%. Titanium sponge, molly, and nickel are flat to down and titanium scrap is down about 15%. So it's a mixed environment for the metals that matter most to EMIP.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Isn't that business pretty heavily weighted towards aerospace and just the driver being maybe GE on the LEAP engine side there. But, should that business perform a little bit better than flat in 2017?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. We're being conservative calling that business.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. We talked extensively in some of our past meetings about where multiple levels removed from the end customer and inventory levels are difficult to estimate. And we're seeing better buying patterns from customers, but there is still some inconsistency.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: So, we may be a bit conservative there, but we'd rather be that than aggressive on the projection.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I understand. Okay. Thank you again for the questions.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hello, Bhupender.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes, Bhupender, we can hear you. Go ahead.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Yeah. Can you talk about Rauland-Borg acquisition? You did mention, I think you gave the mix in terms of equipment versus software. Could you give us a sense how the software part of the business has grown historically? I think, Dave, you gave a number in terms of, I don't remember that, but if you can just give us how the software is going and where would the investment from AMETEK come into the business in terms of, on the equipment side of the software side? Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. It's a – the history of the businesses is predominantly hardware, but software is becoming an increasingly important part of the future software offering. And as we try to extend the nurse call platform to multiple hospitals, you get an enterprise wide platform and that's more software intensive, and that's a part of the business that's very attractive and growing.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: And I'm sure you guys have done some market studies. Could give us a sense of how big the market is here? Or in terms of international, any particular geographies you plan to extend sales from this acquisition?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes. As I mentioned earlier, because it's a family-owned business, they ran the business exceptionally well. But they saw risk in acquisitions and international expansion, and only about 10% of the business is international. And we think the market is about half international. So we think we can help them with that and we think there is considerable runway to improve the business.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And lastly, I just wanted to get a sense of, in terms of BRICS, how did that do actually in the fourth quarter, and how we're thinking about the markets like in terms of 2017, especially China?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. Yeah. We had – 52% of our sales were international in the quarter, and from my view, the two highlights in the quarter were; the U.S. market was much stronger than prior quarters. And we were down about 10% for several quarters in a row in the U.S. and it was down only 2% organically. And that was the strength in our process businesses really across the board, so the U.S. was improving and Asia was about flat organically, and China was up 5%. So the fact that China was up 5% and the U.S. was improving, we're encouraged by that. Europe was down, low mid single digits in line with recent trends. When you look at the BRIC countries in total, they were plus 1% organically in sales in Q4, again with China dominating that, India was flat. So, overall with the U.S. improving and with China now stabilized and starting to grow, we feel pretty good about what we're seeing geographically in our end markets.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. Thanks a lot.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Foung with Gabelli & Company.
James V. Foung - G.research LLC: Hi. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hello.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Jim.
James V. Foung - G.research LLC: Hi, good morning. So just getting back to Rauland-Borg, maybe you could just kind of highlight some of the key products they make on the hardware side since 80% of their business is there? And then, who your competitor has been of (49:57) your hardware and software?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. I'll talk about the products in the healthcare space. The primary product is called the Responder series and it connects all the nurse call stations in a hospital. It's really an indispensable tool for nurses. It provides multiple levels of functionality. It provides a virtual whiteboard status for each patient, so they know the patient status, a nurse at the nurse station can know the patient status for each patient. It provides voice communication between the nurse and patient and it also manages the patient and hospital alarm system, so the alarms in the hospital are controlled by the Rauland system. So it's a indispensable tool for hospitals and an indispensable tool for nurses, and as I mentioned earlier, it's a fantastic tool for hospitals to manage and efficiently utilize our nursing capability. As we know, there has been a perpetual shortage of nurses. So, they're right at the sweet spot of demographic trends, perpetual shortage of nurses and there is a high degree of regulation in the market, the switching costs are very high. So they're right from the product operating cycles and we're bringing new capabilities. So we feel really good about the product offering. As I mentioned, the big competitor will be Ascom internationally, Hill-Rom also has some products in the market, but Rauland-Borg in the U.S. is the market share leader by far.
James V. Foung - G.research LLC: Okay. And then what's the CapEx in that business?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: It's about at the AMETEK average, it's 2% or less CapEx.
James V. Foung - G.research LLC: Okay. Terrific. And then just on getting back to the energy and then the metals business, I guess, you're forecasting flat sales and you say that's kind of conservative. But, what has to happen for you to be more optimistic, as you can reach some growth in that market and may be climb back up to that peak level in a couple of years?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I think the trends that are – we're working through a long cycle, and it's a predictable cycle, and past cycles have been very similar, although not as deep. And it's going to start with the upstream business picking up, and then it's going to flow through to the midstream and downstream, and will probably be a year or two years before the market totally gets returns. At the current price of oil, it's a lot lower than what it was, but it's enough for a positive business to take place. Rig counts were up and that's key for our upstream business. And what customers are telling us is, they actually have capital to spend this year. Last year they really didn't. The authority to spend is back on the business units instead of the C-Suite. They were – all purchase orders had to go to the C-Suite before they'd buy anything. And for our equipment there is some excess capacity out there, and it needs to be utilized. But we're seeing increased activity in the upstream space now, especially in the U.S., and for the midstream and downstream business, we think that's going to be flat to down a bit this year, but we're seeing some good project business in the Middle East. So we're feeling much better this year than we were last year at this time.
James V. Foung - G.research LLC: Okay. Great. Look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks time. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen and Company.
Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe today. I just wanted to talk about the size of your M&A. You've talked before about doing a larger deal, and then, by the way, congrats on the one this morning. But, what drove that change in mindset, and why the change now? Is it because do you see perhaps the distortion in pricing between small companies and larger ones?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No, as I said before, our bread and butter acquisition is still the $50 million, $100 million, $150 million deal, and that's going to stay that way and we had tremendous value to those kind of businesses. But we've been successful in slightly larger deals. So about 9 months ago we expanded our pipeline to include revenue size one notch higher, between $200 million to $500 million. And really we did that because as the business scales and we want to continue our track record of doubling the earnings for the company, we felt that we had to add those larger businesses to our candidate list and we also felt that we've been very successful doing a larger deal. I mean the bigger deals that we've done, we bought ZYGO a couple of years ago, that business is performing extremely well for AMETEK. We bought Dunkermotoren a few years ago, the business is performing extremely well for AMETEK. We've acquired Haydon Kerk. The business is performing extremely well. So we're getting comfortable doing larger deals, but at the same time, we have not stopped doing the bread-and-butter deals. So we just think as we grow and we continue to generate more cash flow, we want to expand our opportunity set.
Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company LLC: Great. Thanks. And then just a second quick one here. Do you feel like you have maintained your market share throughout the cycle or this cycle?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes, I do. Yeah. Just finished our...
Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company LLC: Okay.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: ...strategic planning process about three months ago. We went into that in detail and we're very comfortable with that.
Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Just with Rauland being less of immediate adjacency, you've talked about evolving your process for deal sourcing. Could you describe the process for sourcing Rauland, how it exemplifies some of your, kind of expanded look on cultivating the pipeline?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. I mean, in situations with private companies who are looking to sell their business or looking for a credible seller that has the business model that's flexible enough to deal with the private company. And AMETEK has shown that capability. We have the reputation of being able to do that. And I think Rauland approached a banker and they approached very few companies, because of the uniqueness of the situation, and we're lucky enough to work with the family and get the deal done, and now part of AMETEK. So I think it's really the reputation of AMETEK and the work we're doing in the medical space that kind of in combined brought that business to AMETEK.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And I just wanted to try a little more succinctly, sync up the 1Q bridge to the full year. It looks like a little bit of a slow start that's maybe a little inconsistent with the full year expectation. So just maybe a comment on the bridge?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I mentioned earlier, we're calling a transition from negative organic growth to positive organic growth and in our business with the very high contribution margins, when you get positive organic growth, it's very accretive to profit. But, on the converse, when you have negative organic growth, it's difficult to call that turnover. And we called low single digits for the first quarter, we think that's the right call. And we think that some markets talked about oil and gas are going to grow slowly throughout the year. We're going to see that continuing trend of slight improvement. The benefits also, of course, the benefits of our realignment are a bit back-end loaded. We talked about the realignment and we talked about the benefits of $16 million, and those are going to more favorably impact Q3 and Q4 than Q1 and Q2. And as we've mentioned earlier, Rauland really impacts Q3 and Q4 more than Q1 and Q2 because of some of the acquisition accounting. So those are the three things I'd point you to look at the – a little bit of a ramp in the earnings for the year.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks for summarizing.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Allison. Good morning.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Dave, you talked about the medical and marketing 13% of sales today now with the Rauland acquisition. What's your comfort level in terms of waiting there? I know you mentioned a number of potential opportunities in the pipeline on that side.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. AMETEK's strategy is to be in a bunch of diverse end-markets and we run businesses very effectively in a niche position. So even in the medical space that same limitation occurs. So we don't have a fixed percentage, but any time a product or a market area gets 20% of the company, then we start to think about our diversification and – but we still have room to go and we're still active at looking at the medical space.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. And then just to touch on that, just management capacity in that specific business line or end-market space. Are you comfortable there to continue even though with the latest two acquisitions there?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, we are. The one thing that I mentioned in my opening remarks was, we're getting a very good management team with Rauland. Sales and marketing capability is outstanding. We spent time with the management team. We feel really good. It's going to be a good cultural fit and we feel really good that we're going to bring what we do well to them. So feel really good about the future and the management capability with Rauland.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. And then just R&D, you stepped it up. Is there a specific weighting towards the allocation? Is it broad? Any changes there relative to 2016?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No, no. I think you know our system. I mean, it comes from the bottom up in terms of R&D and the business managers have to tell us what they want to work on and show us that it's a good project to fund and they'll get the funding. But the only thing is we really focused on taking our R&D dollars and spending it in the growth area. So there is a little bit of that, but really it was the same process. It's distributed. It's across all of our businesses. It's a low risk approach, and as I mentioned, we have 24% of sales from new products, so we think that's a healthy level and we have really good engineering capability throughout the company.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks so much, guys.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Allison.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with A.O. Smith Corporation (sic) [BMO Capital Markets].
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Scott, did you join A.O. Smith?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Brandy, I think he might have – Scott's not on the line.
Operator: Scott, your line is open.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yes. I am speaking. Can you hear me?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Now, we can, Scott. Yeah.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: We hear you now, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I have no idea how I am identified with A.O. Smith. I'm going to blame it on Rob McCarthy though.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: He took all of your question.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Wow, that was odd. Okay. So, two questions for you. The one is on the $100 million of cost saves. That's a number that is a little bit higher than what I was thinking. Could you tell me what the procurement piece specifically was in that and then also give us the 2016 final number there?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. The procurement number was $60 million for 2017, so $60 of a $100 million.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Sorry.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: And in 2016, the procurement was $60 million also.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Now, to the same end, Dave, you entered the year with a better organic growth view with the incremental margins from the last restructuring higher on the upside. We have an accretive acquisition and you have guidance that captures the expectations. So I'm sitting there wondering is the $100 million of savings, we're going to see a larger percentage of those savings now being reinvested under Dave Zapico than in the past, those savings were reinvested?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No. I don't think that's necessarily true. I mean we talk about $65 million of growth investments, and we feel it's important to properly fund our sales and marketing expenses on our engineering, but we had a similar amount last year. So, I don't think there is a meaningful change in that area. We're going to make sure that we invest for the future, but it sits in line with the past.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Is there anything specifically about the spending however going forward that you're changing under, sort of under your lot shares that maybe a little bit more focused on areas where there has historically been more growth? What type of shifting in that spending view and vision?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. That's a great question, Scott. I mean, if you want to look at it at the overall level, I think there will be incrementally more spending in sales and marketing expenses, but the same amount of expenditures will be put back in each year. I mean we'll have healthy cost reductions offsetting the investments, but there are some opportunities in sales and marketing, and we're funding some of them this year. So we think they're going to adequately return for AMETEK over the longer term or to benefit from them later this year.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And sort of the last add-on to this, is there – do you envision more spending perhaps to build out channels in the BRICS countries, perhaps in Europe? Is there anything that you see that you may have an opportunity to put some money down and to generate sales growth off that?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. That's a great question, Scott. I mean, one of our investments that we're making this year is an expansion in Southeast Asia. So that's exactly what we're thinking. We see some opportunities in our UPT business, our Ultra Precision Technology business, our Materials Analysis division in Southeast Asia, and one of the key investments that we're making is expansion in sales and marketing channels in that area.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Very good. That's all I had. Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc.
Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks for getting me in. Just two quick ones on Rauland. Do you see – are there adjacent products that you're developing to sell on to that platform? Or do you see the opportunity as more getting the platform into more facilities?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. It's both. I mean, there are adjacent product areas in the non-acute care facilities. There are adjacent product areas in the existing customer base and there are adjacent opportunities internationally. So we feel really good about all the avenues of growth.
Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Are some of those products already under development or is this something that you've looked at the platform and you see the opportunity and now the work starts?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Now, Rauland has some of these products under development, and some of the other product areas are more driven by acquisition than organic development.
Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Got it. And you said half of the market opportunity could be international which is they haven't really pursued. But do you have a dollar amount of what you see is the total addressable market for both the healthcare and the educational side?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. We did the market work and the existing SAM, the served addressable market was about $500 million and the TAM, the total addressable market, was about $1 billion. And we didn't include a lot of the TAM in our discussions, but those are the kind of – it's a niche market, it's a $500 million sort of market. They don't participate much internationally and we feel good about the potential growth opportunities.
Steve Barger - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to the speakers for further closing remarks.
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining. And as a reminder, a replay of the call will be available shortly at ametek.com and at streetevents.com. And certainly, I'm available if there is any further questions. Thank you very much.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the AMETEK Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's third quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are Dave Zapico, Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. AMETEK's third quarter results were released earlier this morning and are available electronically on market systems and on our website at the Investors Section of ametek.com. This call is also webcasted and can be accessed on our website and at streetevents.com. The call will be archived on both of these sites. Before we get started, I want to remind you that any statements made by AMETEK during the call that are not historical in nature are to be considered forward-looking statements. As such, these statements are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risk and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll also refer you to the Investors Section of ametek.com for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures used during this conference call. We'll begin today with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. AMETEK performed well in the third quarter with results in line with our expectations. We feel business conditions across our most challenging markets are beginning to stabilize. Although we remain cautious about the short-term demand environment, we are encouraged with this stabilization. Also, I am pleased to announce that subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Laserage Technology, a provider of laser-based fabrication services for the medical device industry and an excellent fit with our engineered medical components business. With this acquisition, we have now acquired five businesses so far in 2016 and have deployed approximately $390 million in capital. We also deployed approximately $100 million on share repurchases during the third quarter. To support our capital deployment activities, we announced today that we entered into a private placement agreement to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes at attractive rates. We will provide more detail on the recent acquisition and our private placement later but as these activities show, AMETEK remains committed to the disciplined deployment of capital. Now let me provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales were in line with our expectations in the third quarter, at $945 million, down 5% versus the third quarter of 2015. Organic sales were down 8% while acquisitions added 3%. The impact from foreign currency in the quarter was negligible. Operating income in the quarter was $201.1 million and operating income margin was 21.3%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.56, down 14% over last year's third quarter. Now turning to the individual operating groups; first Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $579.3 million were down 3% versus last year's third quarter. Organic sales were down 8%, acquisitions contributed 5%, and foreign currency was flat. The strong acquisition growth was driven by the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Brookfield, ESP/SurgeX, Nu Instruments and HS Foils. The organic sales decline was driven in part by weakness across our oil and gas markets. Results for our oil and gas businesses were as expected, with conditions beginning to stabilize across each of our upstream, midstream and downstream businesses. EIG's operating income in the third quarter was $142.7 million and operating income margins were 24.6%. The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $365.7 million, down 9% versus the third quarter of last year with organic sales down 7% and foreign currency a 1% headwind. The largest driver of the sales weakness was our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. This business has also begun to stabilize and we expect to see similar conditions in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter. EMG's operating income was $71.4 million in the quarter and operating margins were 19.5%. Now let me provide some background on the acquisition we announced this morning. Laserage is a leading provider of laser fabrication services to the medical device market. They offer precision tube fabrication of minimally invasive surgical devices, stents, specialty catheters and catheter-based delivery systems. They also have excellent design capabilities for medical devices. Laserage is an excellent addition to our growing presence in the medical industry. It is a very strategic fit with our engineered medical components business that provides excellent market and technology synergies. In addition, the business operates in markets and applications with strong growth characteristics. Laserage was privately held, is headquartered in Waukegan, Illinois, with a manufacturing facility in Milpitas, California. Laserage has annual sales of $22 million. I would like to welcome the team from Laserage to AMETEK. We remain very active in identifying and executing highly strategic acquisitions across our businesses. The pipeline of acquisitions remains very solid and our teams continue to do an outstanding job supporting our M&A efforts. In addition to our continued focus on investing in strategic acquisitions, we continued to make investments to support long-term organic growth. In particular, we continued to make sizable investments in research, development and engineering and in 2016 we expect to invest $205 million or 5% of sales. I want to highlight just a few of our recent new product introductions. Our Solartron Analytical business, a global leader in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for materials in electrochemical research has added four new application specific instruments to their Apps-XM series of laboratory instruments. The XM stands for extreme measurement and each new instrument was developed with specific capabilities for highly targeted research applications. Each occupies less than half the footprint of similar laboratory instruments and provides increased measurement performance. These instruments are used for testing energy storage devices such as batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells as well as for testing materials used in photovoltaic and solar cell applications. AMETEK Aerospace and Defense developed a patent pending exhaust gas thermocouple with a sheath made from an advanced ceramic matrix composite. The thermocouple is used to measure temperature in jet engine exhaust gases and its highly-advanced ceramic matrix sheathing extends the thermocouple's high temperature performance range. The sheathing material is one-third as dense as steel and nickel alloys, exhibits better performance than pure ceramic materials and extends the life of the thermocouple, helping to postpone costly jet engine overhauls. Our Vision Research business, which is a leader in high-speed imaging systems, unveiled its new family of Phantom VEO high-speed cameras. These compact rugged cameras are designed for a wide range of applications, including scientific analysis, material testing and defense research. The VEO family includes eight individual models across four performance levels and two body styles providing users with flexibility for their specific needs. These high-speed high-resolution cameras are packed full of features in a 5-inch cube that is designed for durability and can withstand up to 100 Gs of force. These investments in research and development, combined with our strong engineering talent across the company, are driving excellent new product development results. Revenue from new products introduced over the last three years, our vitality index, was an excellent 25% in the quarter. We also remain focused on driving our operational excellence strategy. Our teams are doing an excellent job driving continual operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging our operational excellence toolkit. Overall in 2016, we expect to generate $130 million in total operational excellence savings. These operational excellence activities include; lean manufacturing, global sourcing and strategic procurement, value analysis and value engineering, design for Six Sigma and the movement of production to low cost locales. These OpEx initiatives also include various tools that are focused on the front-end of our business. As I noted last quarter, we are focused on leveraging and broadening tools in this area across all of our businesses to ensure we are properly positioned for long-term growth. Now I will turn to the outlook for the balance of the year. Our expectations remain unchanged for the year. We continue to expect 2016 revenue to be down low single-digits on a percentage basis from 2015, with organic sales down mid-single digits. We have tightened our guidance range for 2016 to a range of approximately $2.29 to $2.31 per diluted share, leaving the midpoint of the guidance unchanged at $2.30. Fourth quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low-single digits versus the fourth quarter of 2015, with earnings of approximately $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share. In summary, we delivered results that were in line with our expectations. We have reaffirmed our full year sales guidance and the midpoint of our earnings guidance. We have acquired five high quality businesses in 2016 and our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is excellent. We generate strong free cash flow and have the balance sheet flexibility to continue to acquire great businesses. We remain focused on aggressively managing our businesses in the short term while ensuring we make appropriate investments to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. We have a deep and talented management team that'll continue to execute our four growth strategies. I am very bullish on the future of AMETEK and believe we all are well positioned to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward. Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details and provide more information on our private placement. Then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, our businesses performed well in the third quarter with solid results that met our expectations. I'll provide some of the financial highlights. In the quarter, organic selling expenses were down roughly in line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were up over last year's third quarter on higher consulting costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, down from last year's rate of 26.1%. We continue to expect our tax rate for 2016 to be between 26% and 27%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables was 20.8% of sales in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $15 million for the quarter and we expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $42 million and for the full year we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $165 million. Operating cash flow was $169 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $154 million, representing 118% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be a strong 125% of net income. We've been very active deploying our free cash flow this year. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $65 million on the acquisitions of Nu Instruments and HS Foils, and subsequent to the end of the quarter we deployed approximately $32 million on the acquisition of Laserage. These acquisitions bring our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $390 million. In addition, during the third quarter we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our stock for approximately $100 million. The highest priority for our cash flow remains acquisitions, however, as we have shown, we will look to opportunistically deploy our cash flow on share buybacks. Total debt at September 30 was $2.15 billion, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $445 million resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 34%. At September 30 we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. As we announced this morning, we entered into a private placement on October 31 to sell the equivalent of approximately $825 million in senior notes. We are issuing €500 million and £225 million, all with maturities ranging from 10 years to 15 years. The proceeds of this offering will be used to pay down our revolver balance and to repay a $40 million British pound note due later this month. The private placement was well received by our lenders. Overall, this issuance had a weighted average interest rate of 1.82% and a weighted average maturity of 11.5 years. This offering provides AMETEK with a larger financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses managed very well in the third quarter in the face of challenging market conditions. We remain active in deploying capital and are well positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Bill. Brent, we'd like to open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Scott. Good morning.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning to you all. Thank you. Could you just talk about the tone of sales as the third quarter progressed and maybe give us kind of the same on order rates, maybe also tell us the organic order rate change in the quarter?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. Sure, Scott. I'll start with sales. I mean overall, sales came in in line with our expectations. We said we'd down mid-single digits and we were down 5% and so it's right on. Organic sales were down close to 7.5%, which is very close to our expectations. We did see some weaker growth on our aerospace segment mainly because of the business and regional jet market slowed a bit, but it was a bit stronger growth in our Ultra Precision Technologies business. So when you look at the whole picture, during Q3 it played out largely as we expected. If you recall, we did a deep dive at the end of the second quarter to reforecast and it turned out exactly as we thought. In terms of orders we – the organic order rates in the quarter were minus 3.5%. So the organic sales were down 8%, so we got some momentum, book-to-bill was 1.02 and the orders trended up in the quarter, so we're feeling good going into Q4.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Very good. And that typical analysis that Frank did and then you kind of jumped in on last quarter, Dave, would you mind doing that, the divisional analysis?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. Sure, Scott. Overall, aerospace sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter. We continued to see strong growth in our commercial OEM business. We won excellent content across a wide number of next generation commercial aircraft platforms, and we're really well positioned to benefit from this continued growth. Our business and regional jet business continues to be weak, and the military was down a bit in the quarter due to program timing. So, for all of 2016 we expect aerospace sales to be down low-single digits, solid growth in our commercial OEM businesses offset largely by weakness in the business and regional jet. Now jumping into the Process segment, organic sales in Process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, this was in line with our expectations, and driven by weakness across our oil and gas businesses. We did see stabilization within our oil and gas businesses during the quarter, as we expected, and we expect this stabilization to continue through the fourth quarter. Our Ultra Precision Technologies, our UPT business, again had a very strong quarter with good growth across their businesses and as a result of new product rollouts and global and new market expansion initiatives, it was a very positive quarter. For all of 2016, we continue to expect organic sales for our Process businesses to be down mid-single digits to high-single digits, driven largely by oil and gas. Our sales for our Power and Industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in the quarter driven by the contributions from acquisitions, ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield. Organic sales were down low-double digits in the quarter driven by a difficult prior year comparison. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales from Power and Industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which is unchanged from our prior forecast. Organic sales for our differentiated EMG businesses were down mid-single digits driven largely by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. We are starting to see stabilization in this business also as expected like oil and gas. For all of differentiated EMG, we continue to expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. Floorcare and Specialty Motors business, the last segment, our smallest segment, organic sales were down high-single digits in the third quarter, driven by softer demand across key markets. And for all 2016, we expect sales for this business to be down mid-single digits organically, unchanged from the previous expectations. When you look at it from the group level, for all of EIG, it's unchanged from prior guidance we provided last quarter. We continue to expect overall sales to be down both single-digits with organic sales down mid-single-digits. Do the same for EMG, it's the same as prior guidance we provided last quarter with both overall and organic sales down mid-single digits and for all of AMETEK our guidance remains unchanged. With overall sales expected to be down low-single digits and organic sales down mid-single digits.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Very good, Dave. Thanks very much for your time.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Hi, good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Matt.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Just a couple follow-ups, on the oil and gas side of things, can you size that business for us today in terms of where you think it comes in overall for 2016 and not just in EIG, but also if you want to call it kind of your collateral exposure that you have in other parts of the businesses and then are you able to put some numbers around the point you're making that you're seeing stabilization, can you kind of walk us through how that business has maybe progressed to get you to that conclusion? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. Right. Yeah. I'll start with entering the year, the oil and gas presence for AMETEK was about $360 million and that's across our entire business. The majority of that is in Electronic Instruments though in our Process segment. As the year played out that business is going to be down about 33% or down about $120 million. That's a – we had a 60% decline in our upstream business and a 60% decline in our mid and downstream businesses. So, if you go back to at the peak, our upstream sales are down about 70% tied to the rig count decline and our midstream and downstream businesses are down about 20% driven by cuts in capital spending and delayed maintenance work. So we saw the peak in 2014, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. We got into – in 2015, we saw an initial decline in our upstream business. In 2016, we saw a continuing decline in the upstream and then flowing through to the midstream and maybe we'll end up down about a third again, we're about $240 million coming out of 2016. We you look at it, I feel good about it, one, I look at the order rates. I mean, the order rates for our businesses are supporting a flat Q4, largely in the – that's a longer backlog business with some short-term MRO business, but I feel good about the backlog we have entering the quarter. When I think about the beginning of the year, we were down large percentages in oil and gas, 35% in Q1, about the same in Q2. In Q3 we're down about 20% and we think that will continue till we're down even less in Q4. So, the sequential run rates in the business definitely have stabilized, our order rates have stabilized and I think we took a good look at it at the end of Q2, and it feels the same right now.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Great. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Hi, Allison.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Just – I know you talked about maybe military spending spilling over, but has there been any noted changes in customer buying patterns? I know you're comfortable with orders, but just, do you feel like anything is getting deferred into next year as we're close to exiting 2016 at this point?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No, I don't really feel that way. I mean, in the quarter, we did see some additional weakness in our business jet business. And there were some, on the military side, some programs that were some timing issues, but in general, we didn't see much change in the ordering pattern, so the orders accelerated through the quarter and we feel well positioned for Q4.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. And then just – thanks for the color on oil and gas – but as we look, things have stabilized, how should we think of your business or the flow-through to your business, if we start to see activity start to improve as we enter 2017 for you guys?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. We haven't done our planning for 2017 yet, so we're not going to have much guidance on that. But I think, what we're seeing is rig counts have started to pick up, activity is beginning. The market is starting to come back in equilibrium. That will continue through 2017. Certainly, in 2017, we aren't going to have the same headwinds that we had this year. And we're going to sit down with our business during our budgeting cycle and all of our businesses during our budgeting cycle, during the next few weeks, and get a real good feel for what's going on and we're going to communicate that guidance to you at our Q4 earnings call. But it really played out as expected. And going into next year, we'll find out but we certainly aren't going to expect to the headwinds that we had.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. I guess what I'm – I mean, is there a certain lag effect that we should expect for you guys traditionally or historically? I mean, what have you experienced when we've come out of something like this?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I think, there is – you really have a situation where there is excess capacity built up in the industry. And that excess capacity has to be utilized. So there may be a bit of a – if you look at our upstream business, that business typically, long term follows the Baker Hughes drilling rig index. But it doesn't follow it directly, usually, the rigging index picks up and then we'll follow as capacity is used. So, there could be a lag but – and I think, during 2017 that will play out. Again, we're going to get detailed insight from our businesses, but one thing that we're sure of is that any small increase in organic growth, we've leaned the cost structure of these businesses out. These businesses are very well managed, they have strong market positions, high market share in our oil and gas businesses, and we're poised to capitalize on any market growth when it returns, but we're not forecasting any right now.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Bhupender.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: So, I think just on the geographic, if you can give the growth in different geographies around the world. And especially, can you remind us how much BRIC is for AMETEK in terms of sales and how those regions actually performed in the quarter? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure, sure. I'm glad to do that. I'll start with the U.S. We were down low double digits versus the prior year. It was driven by broad industrial weakness, but the key factors driving the negative growth were oil and gas and metals. And if you look at our trend, it's really been that way for the last three quarters. We've had about low-double digit, 10% decline the last three quarters. So it's stabilized at that level. If we jump over Europe, it was down low-single digits, in line with recent trends there; we've been down low-single digits for the better part of a year. Asia was the one positive, it was up 1% organically. If you think back over the past year, year and a half, it was down low-double digits and down low-double digits, down 10%, down mid-single digits sequentially in quarters, now it's up 1%. And China, the biggest driver in Asia, was down slightly, so down about 1%. So we feel pretty good about Asia. We had good performance in Japan and Korea and some other markets, so it was up 1% organically. When you go to the BRIC countries, now overall the BRIC countries are 11% of sales. We've been very successful historically in the BRIC countries, but the emerging markets are challenged right now. Our emerging market exposure is dominated by China, it's the largest by far. And as I already mentioned, we were down about 1%, but when you look at places like Brazil and Russia, they were down very significant double digits, 20% plus in each of those markets. And India has been a different story, it's been growing at mid-single digit rates. This quarter it was a little different, it was down a bit, about 20%, but that's more from large program orders. We don't really have a base business in India yet, so it will bounce around, but I really see that trend continuing. So, basically, in BRIC countries we have China stabilized, that's the biggest market, India on a slow growth path and Brazil and Russia in the dumps.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay, got it. I know you give the organic growth orders rate here. Can you give the orders growth rate for EIG and EMG on a core basis?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I'll go through the whole orders profile for you. We booked about $964 million of orders in the quarter. The total orders were down 2%. As I mentioned earlier to Scott, the organic orders were down 3.5%. EIG organic orders were down 5%, and EMG organic orders were down 1%.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay, got it. And lastly on the EMIP business, I mean, you said that that business had stabilized quarter-to-quarter and you – now can you give us some insight into the destocking which you have seen over the last three quarters in that business, especially on the metals side, how that's progressing and where we are with that? Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. We continue to expect sales will be down roughly $125 million, that's about 25% in 2016, but the year-over-year declines will moderate in Q4 due to easier comps; so we're seeing stabilization begin in the market. The pricing trends, we talked about the pricing trends for key metals we have exposure to, are mixed, with some increasing, like nickel and vanadium over the last quarter, and some decreasing, like molybdenum and titanium; so that's mixed. As I mentioned last quarter and to your point, our visibility into inventory levels within this market, this channel, is limited, but it's largely playing out as expected. We're seeing orders coming from inventory depleted businesses, customers and we're not seeing orders in other places where the inventory is still there. So, we're certainly not saying the inventory destocking is complete, but we're seeing enough order rates to be comfortable that our fourth quarter is going to be a lot like our third quarter and that's our forecast for EMIP.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, Dave.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Vertical Research.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hi, good morning, all.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Brett.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hey, just wanted to come back to the comments regarding business stabilization. It sounds like the optics of easing comps is helping that narrative. Are you seeing an actual fundamental inflection in the tone in those businesses or is it more an element of comparisons? And then any early view on 2017 expectations as you see some of these headwinds abate?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, the first point is, you're correct, we are seeing easier comps as we progress through the year. But in our last call, we spent a lot of time comparing the second half of the year to the first half of the year, and they were essentially carbon copies of each other. So along with the easier comps, the business has stabilized, because the second half of the year we're going to do very similar to the volume and profitability that we did in the first half. Regarding 2017, I'm just not going to give guidance right now. We typically don't give it till the – we release our fourth quarter earnings. We have a very fulsome budget process, where Bill and I sit down with each of our business units. We have a very detailed process that we work through. Certainly, we're not expecting a major change in the global macro environment, we'll be focused on driving cost reduction through our operational excellence activities. But we're not going to comment on it until we get to the fourth quarter earnings.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And then just with regards to the private placement offering, sounds like a smart transaction there. Do you expect any interest savings? And then I guess as you look at available cash and free cash flow generation and the new capacity it provides, how should we think about that over the – capacity over the next 12 months with this new arrangement?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. I think the – from – this is Bill Burke, I think from an interest rate perspective, certainly, the rate that we're talking about is very close to the revolver rate that we're paying which is about 1.7% before any Fed action. So, I think it's pretty much of a wash from that perspective. But what it really does is it gives us a lot of capacity to go after, whether to – in terms of capital deployment, in particular going after acquisitions. So, I think it's really just a retooling of that capacity, and if you think about it, we took short-term debt and put it out for 11.5 years at essentially the same interest rate. So it was a no brainer from that perspective, but I think most importantly, it also gives us the capacity to continue our capital deployment.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: And would you be able to maybe size that, the incremental capacity that it does provide?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. We have with cash and unused revolver capacity, we have approximately $1.5 billion of firepower to go at acquisitions. So we're pretty pleased with that. We've got a strong balance sheet and we're looking to deploy it. We have a great pipeline of deals and we're aggressively working a lot of them.
Brett Logan Linzey - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. And sir, please make sure that your line is not on mute.
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Brent, why don't we to the next caller. We can get back to Deane.
Operator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): So, I think the outlook for the year is up low-single digits, that really implies the absolute sales level in the fourth quarter is up meaningfully from the third, otherwise we're really talking about down mid-single digits reported for the year. So, I'm just wondering where you see the volumes ramping sequentially, what the dynamics are to get to that rate.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Sure. Sure. There is a ramp on our sales from 3Q to 4Q as you mentioned. We typically see a sequential ramp from quarter four to quarter three, so the increase was as expected and it's largely driven by the normal seasonality patterns that we expect to play out in our businesses. The places where our business, our seasonality plays out is our Process businesses and we're seeing those order entry rates indicate that that's going to happen; a little bit of our Power business has a bit of seasonality. So, when you look across our portfolio, we have businesses that have a bit of seasonality. It's built into the forecast and as I mentioned last quarter, our Q4 is a lot like our Q2. So, we don't have anything heroic forecasted, just a typical sequential ramp up due to seasonality.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. It's interesting, because a lot of companies have talked about, kind of not seeing the seasonality into year end. So, is there anything kind of lumpy that's helping with that bridge maybe in the fourth?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No. I don't think so. I mean – yeah, I'd look – I'd point you to our organic rates at – or our organic sales in Q3 were, as I said, down about 7.5% and our orders were down about 3.5% and we have a little ramp to get through, but it's very similar to what we did in Q2.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then maybe try to sidewalk around the aversion to 2017 comments at this point. But as you get out of this year the comparisons do reset meaningfully, any areas where you – it kind of feels like the comparisons could be a point of particular differentiation for you?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. If you think about our narrative, our first half of the year was much like our second half of the year. So, it's kind of flattened out. So, there aren't big comparison benefits that we'll see going into next year. Now certainly, we won't see the oil and gas headwinds. We don't expect to see the headwinds in the metals business. So those will be better. But it's not like we're entering next year with a bunch of easy comps. The business has flattened out, we're glad it's flattened out. We've got our hands around it and now we're focused on our budget. And profit improvement that we're going to get in 2017 is going to come from what we learn in those budget meetings, it's going to come from our operational excellence activities and it's going to come from M&A.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Great, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, gents.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, on the timing of the prior placements, it sounds like it's more driven by the Fed – like the Fed goes in December and therefore, the revolver rate goes up, is that right or is that more an indication of your confidence in deploying that capital?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah. It wasn't – that wasn't the primary driver. That may happen but as Bill said, it was a no-brainer. We had revolver debt at short-term rates that we can term out to 11.5 years, and have a very, very small interest rate change, so. And that was the primary reason, but we do have confidence that we're going to be able to deploy the capital. We have a – we're well positioned I think in our acquisition world right now, it remains the primary use of our cash flow, it's a core competency and key driver of long-term value. We have disciplined processes around our sourcing, around our diligence, around our integration. We told you that we've added capacity and made some changes in sourcing new deals, and we expanded our pipeline to slightly larger businesses, while leaving our bread and butter deals in the $50 million to $200 million range. And it's been – we got five deals done this year, deployed $390 million in capital, and the year is not over, our pipeline is very good, it appears to have picked up a bit. And the private placement feeds right into that, because we have about $1.5 billion in cash and unused space on our revolver. So, we're feeling really good about being able to deploy the capital and we're feeling really good about the opportunities also.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Oh, sure. I mean, long-term debt at 1.7% is a no-brainer, but we are seeing more large deals getting done and...
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Actually, Nigel, it was 1.82%. 1.7% was what our revolver debt is now. We termed it out at 1.82%.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for clarification. But we are seeing larger deals get announced in the public market, so I'm wondering if the texture of your M&A backlog, if that's changing and whether we've seen a mix towards more large opportunities?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, we expanded our pipeline of opportunities to include businesses in the revenue of $500 million. So certainly those deals are working its way through the pipeline. So, in terms of mix there is a larger mix of bigger businesses, but that doesn't change the fundamental bread and butter of the business, the $50 million to $100 million to $200 million deals, and I think the backlog that we're seeing right now is a healthy mix of $50 million, $100 million, $200 million deals and a couple of the bigger deals we're looking at. So we're very active right now and we don't have anything for sure, definitely, but we're spending a lot of time and effort evaluating these opportunities and we have the balance sheet to execute on them.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: No question. And then on the – a quick one on pricing, any change in the price environments by business?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No it's about the same, we got about 1.2% of price during the quarter, largely it's playing out the same as the prior quarters where the oil and gas market, the metals market are where the pricing is most difficult, but overall we're getting positive price.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks a lot.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thanks, Nigel.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Well, I guess...
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ...we didn't have the cut for 2016, so that's good. And I guess there's not going to be much about 2017 and there's been a lot of questions asked. Just expanding on Nigel's comments around price, could you talk a little bit about kind of the pricing environment this year versus previous years? And what would be your expectation if we did see kind of an uptick in either material inflation or a better pricing environment, what it would mean for your margins going forward?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, because of our strong niche market positions, I definitely feel that we have pricing power in our business. What you saw this year is a lot of migration to lower capability products within our portfolio, so instead of buying the high end product that can do just about everything with all the bells and whistles, the customers migrated to more basic functionality and that really happened in the last downturn, back in 2009 also. So we expected it. So along with that price effect we have, which has been very difficult in the markets that are under duress that we've talked a lot about like oil and gas and metals, you also have a mix effect where people are buying down the product line. So, those will be the two big factors that I would see and I think as the market stabilizes that we'll see a slow migration back up to the high end of the portfolio and we expect to get positive price. So, our pricing was greater than total inflation in the business by a bit in the quarter, so we've been able to offset our total inflation. And it's not a good pricing environment. If I look back a couple of years, we were getting two points of price, so it's definitely down, but we're pricing in excess of inflation, and I think that will improve as the general economic global macro-economic trends improve.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Well, I mean, obviously, slow macro environment does create opportunity, perhaps increased focus on global excellence, increased organic improvement in the business, maybe even some restructuring. How are you thinking about that going into 2017 from a planning perspective in terms of, if you're in a slow macro environment, what levers can you really pull here to drive longer term value in 2018 and beyond?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. So, in 2015, we did quite a lot of restructuring. We had two restructurings, and we just really completed them recently. And as we look through our businesses through this budgeting process, we're going to look at all the tools we have, low cost production, sourcing, lean manufacturing, all the tools in the AMETEK toolkit. And I feel comfortable, this year, we had $130 million in cost reductions from the restructuring and the cost reductions and I feel confident that we'll have another healthy number going into 2017, but I'm going to wait to comment on that because I have to get through the budgeting process and we have to look at what each of our businesses plans on doing.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Congratulations on a good quarter.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America: Good morning.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Good morning, Andrew.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America: Just a question. Looking where you're able to do your private placement, seems like the rates are quite attractive. As we're sitting at the bottom for interest rates, does that change your view on how much you – what kind of multiples you can pay up for deals, given just how attractive financing is? Because historically you guys have been an absolute return company and what we see is that the companies who are able to do deals in this environment more of a spread approach, are you reconsidering that?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: No, not reconsidering that, Andrew. We're still an absolute return company. I think the key metric for us is our return on invested capital in year three. That number has been 10% for quite a long time and it's still 10%, and that means we have to parse the deals that we're looking at and we need a strong viable pipeline, which we have now, to find a deal that we can get the hurdle rate to10% ROIC in year three. So, we have not taken a relative approach on pricing. It's still absolute and the returns and pricing on deals and the pipeline that we have is better than it's been in the past, and I feel positive that we will deploy the cash and unused revolver capacity to get some deals done moving forward. Now, we can't predict when deals happen any quarter, or because we have to finish our diligence and we have to get through a lot of things, but we have a lot of activity going on, and our teams are active and working many processes, so I'm optimistic that some of that will turn into a positive, and we'll be able to deploy some of our cash.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America: And just a follow up on your markets, historically you have described your portfolio, the bulk of it was very steady, then part of it was doing well, part of it was not doing well, within the part that's doing steady, what parts of the business are you paying attention to going to 2017 with potential inflection points?
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah, Andrew, I'm going to come back to the same comment about working through our budgets, but I will comment that our Metrology businesses are doing well, our UPT businesses are doing well. The exposure we have to the medical market is doing well. The commercial aerospace market, our OEM commercial aerospace sales are strong and we don't see an ending to that. So, I'd point to those for positives and a lot of our other markets are flat to down a bit and they are dealing with the same slow global macro conditions and the same that all businesses are dealing with.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America: Well I tried. Thank you.
William J. Burke - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Margot with Cowen & Company.
Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions here. Do you consider yourself to be a more cyclical company now than if we would have asked maybe before prices made their big decline?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: I believe that just about all markets cycle in the long run and we do have cyclical exposure in our portfolio, 20% of our business is down nearly 30% and we've talked about that. And when you think about AMETEK, our strategy is to focus on a broad, diverse set of niche markets and to look to grow and expand in these niche markets, both organically and through M&A. So, we don't want to become overexposed in any one single market. In fact, we have the same philosophy of any one single customer, or any single technology. So we'll look to continue that balance. We don't have exposure to some of the markets in which have been growing recently, like the construction markets, non-residential construction or residential construction. We don't have a big exposure to the consumer market, we have a limited exposure to the automotive market. All these markets are cyclical as well, but they're doing well right now and will cycle down at some point in the future. So the way I look at it, we weathered the worst of the cyclical market downturns in oil and gas and metals. Our cost structure is leaned out. Our businesses remain well positioned in their niches, we have excellent niche positions. So, we're very optimistic we're going to see sizable profit improvement when the market returns.
Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. And then I think you mentioned your thermocouples and using exhaust gases in your prepared remarks, and...
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Correct.
Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: ...I was wondering if you could use that ceramic protection in other application, I don't know, maybe inside heaters in refineries or any such applications?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yes. It's possible to use the material in other applications certainly. The right spot is in exhaust gas thermocouples though because they're right in the high temperature exhaust gases and if you have a thermocouple that can – there are multiple used on every aircraft engine, and if you can get your thermocouple to last a bit longer and allow the airlines to fly the planes a bit longer, that adds value and that's the application that we're focused on right now and we're very optimistic about it.
Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Absolutely. Thank you so much.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Sorry to get another bite at the apple here. The mix was a big margin headwind this year, presumably a lack of mix next year. So, relative to the organic headwinds this year and assuming more neutral next year, what does that mean to lose that mix headwind? How much did that hurt you this year, do you think?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Well, I think the mix has been a substantial issue and one of the components of our margin decline. The biggest issue has been the drop in organic growth rate, to be clear. Then there is a mix effect also and we didn't get the pricing that we like this year. So, all that will go into the mix of figuring out how next year looks, but I would – I don't think – it really depends on the overall global economic environment and I can't predict an improvement in mix at this point, but I understand your point, you think it could get better, but I'm really not saying that at this point until I've gone through the budgets with our folks.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Just a quick one from me also, although the answer is probably longer than the question. Dave, as you are going through the budget process for 2017, obviously you're going tend very carefully to the organic situation, which it does not look like your organic sales have declined more than your end markets have, particularly in the two businesses that have been problematic. But I think historically, the view has been that because of the types of businesses that you're in, that they would not decline as much as the end market. That does not seem to be the case. So really two questions stem from that, number one, what is the plan for those businesses to sort of make them outperformers in their market? And secondly, as you approach organic in the other businesses, is there more of a portfolio change that might be needed here more toward the faster growing businesses and markets that you purchased in recent years and maybe away from some of the more basic industrial ones that you kind of took with you from last decade?
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Right. There's a lot of questions there, Scott. We'll start with the last question first. As I mentioned before, our strategy is to play in a broad set of diverse niche markets and we look to grow and expand these niches, so and really diversification is a key point, we don't want to get over exposed to any one single market and even though we've had tremendous headwinds in oil and gas and metals markets we're still a very profitable company. Some of the best margins in the industrial space. So the diversity is serving us well there. When we think about parts of our portfolio that we're doing well in and I mentioned our UPT business, I mentioned the medical space, I mentioned commercial OEM aerospace, those are in the acquisition queue with all the other business. So we'd like to acquire more businesses in those areas for sure. When you asked – I'll answer the first part of your question saying, I'm actually pleased with the performance of our businesses in the cyclical markets, the oil and gas and metals business. We've leaned out the cost structures, those are excellent businesses, with excellent niche positions and I'm not sure how the organic growth is going to play out, but I can tell you when it comes back we're going to make a lot of money, because those cost structures are leaned out. And regarding the organic growth of the company, I mentioned last quarter that we want to focus on the organic growth and making sure we're getting our fair share of the business, and really focus on the front-end of the business and get as good in our sales and marketing functions as we are in our operational functions. So we need our customer facing capabilities to equal our strong operational capabilities and we're working on that by looking at best practices and tools around our company and doing the same thing we did in the operations of apply them to our entire business. So we're focusing on key initiatives in that area and that's largely driven from the fact that the next five years, we might not be able to – if you think back from 2005 to 2015, AMETEK grew 3% compounded annual growth rate and organic growth. We grew 8% in M&A. So 11% top-line and we've got 16% compound annual growth and EPS for the bottom line. If we want to continue that over the next few years, the next five years, which we clearly do, we're just going to take some efforts to work on organic growth across the company to make sure that we can outperform in that area. We're not talking about a meaningful change in it and not a needle mover long-term, certainly not any benefit in 2017, but in 2018 I hope we'll see some benefits of some slightly better organic growth.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks a lot, Dave.
David A. Zapico - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time.
Kevin C. Coleman - AMETEK, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks everyone for joining our call today. And as a reminder, a replay of the call may be accessed on our website at ametek.com and at streetevents.com. Thanks and have a great day.

Operator: I would like to welcome everyone to the AMETEK Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Kevin Coleman, you may begin your conference.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. Good morning. Thank you everyone for joining us for our second quarter earnings conference call. With me this morning are Dave Zapico, Chief Executive Officer, and Will Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. AMETEK's second quarter results were released earlier this morning. These results are available electronically on market systems and on our website at the Investor Section of the ametek.com. This call is also webcasted. It can be accessed on our website and at streetevents.com. The call will be archived on both of those sites. Before we get started, I will remind you that any statements made by AMETEK during the call that are not historical in nature are to be considered forward-looking statements. As such, these statements are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update, or revise any forward-looking statements. I'll also refer you to the Investor Section of ametek.com for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures used during this call. We'll begin with some prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning. AMETEK delivered a second quarter results that were in line with our expectations, reflecting the strong efforts of our businesses in managing in a challenging global environment. Also, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired two businesses, Nu Instruments, a leading provider of magnetic sector mass spectrometers and HS Foils, a provider of radiation detector components. Both are excellent strategic fits with existing AMETEK businesses. I'll talk further about these acquisitions in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales were in line with expectations in the second quarter at $977.7 million, down 3%, organic sales were down 7%, while acquisitions added 4%. The impact from currency in the quarter was negligible. Operating income was $219 million and operating income margin was 22.4%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.59, down 8% over last year's second quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating cash flow was very solid in the second quarter at $189 million, up 16% from the last year's second quarter, free cash flow conversions and net income was a strong 126%. Now, turning to the individual operating groups. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales of $596 million were in line with last year's second quarter, organic sales were down 6%, acquisitions contributed 6% and foreign currency was flat. The contributions from recent acquisitions of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX were offset in large part by the weakness across our oil and gas business. As noted, we continue to face challenging conditions across our oil and gas business. Despite the modest rebound in the price of oil from it's February lows, customers remain cautious. They continued to defer maintenance work, and capital projects are being delayed. However, it appears as if conditions are stabilizing at lower levels than we previously anticipated. EIG's operating income in the second quarter was a $152.1 million, and operating margins were a strong 25.5%. The Electromechanical Group reported overall sales of $381.7 million, down 6% versus the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 8%, acquisitions contributed 2% and foreign currency was flat. EMG sales remained pressured by weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses, driven largely by the continued headwinds from our Specialty Metals business. This business has stabilized. However, we do not anticipate improvements in the second half as we previously expected. EMG's operating income was $80.3 million in the quarter and operating margins were a solid 21%. Now let me provide background on the two acquisitions we announced this morning. First, Nu Instruments. Nu Instruments manufactures magnetic sector mass spectrometer used for elemental and isotopic analysis. Nu's mass spectrometers utilize a magnetic field to separate the isotopes of elements in order to analyze the material characterization of the sample. Their products are used in advanced laboratory analysis within earth and environmental sciences, material characterization and nuclear applications. Nu is an excellent strategic fit with our CAMECA advanced elemental analysis business. Nu's strong R&D capabilities and highly complementary product offerings will allow us to expand our presence in existing markets, we're opening up opportunities to expand to new attractive market segments. In addition, Nu will be able to leverage to meet the strong global sales and service channels to help accelerate growth.Nu Instruments is headquartered in Wrexham in the UK with additional offices in Beijing and Tokyo. It has annual sales of approximately $25 million. The second acquisition is HS Foils. HS Foils develops and produces the key components used in radiation detectors. Each components include ultrathin radiation windows, silicon drift detectors and x-ray filters. HS Foils was an excellent technology acquisition for AMETEK. It provides us with unique patented intellectual property around silicon nitride window technology as well as extensive knowledges in silicon PIN and silicon drift detector manufacturing. HS Foils' technology will enable world class instrument performance across many of our Materials Analysis businesses, including Amptek, EDAX, SPECTRO and CAMECA. In addition, HS Foils operates out of the state of the art semiconductor lab in Helsinki, Finland, which will help accelerate new product development initiatives. With these two acquisitions we've now deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired over $150 million in revenue on four acquisitions, so far in 2016. Our business unit and corporate teams remain active in identifying and pursing acquisition opportunities and we remain encouraged with the acquisition pipeline. The highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. Let me transition from highlighting our recent acquisitions to highlighting an acquisition we completed in 2013. Creaform, which we acquired in October 2013, is a leading provider of 3D measurement technologies and services. They are the industry leader in standalone portable 3D scanners. Creaform's optically-based devices are used across a number of high growth applications within the aerospace, automotive and general industrial markets. Key applications for their products include reverse engineering, dimensional inspection, precision manufacturing, automated quality control and 3D printing. Creaform has been a tremendously successful acquisition for AMETEK, with impressive results across all key financial and operational metrics. They have leveraged AMETEK's growth strategies, to help deliver outstanding results. Here are just a few of the highlights of their success. Organic sales have grown at double-digit rates since acquisition, operating margins have more than doubled, working capital as a percentage of sales has improved over 700 basis points to its current level of approximately 13% of sales. And sales from new products have increased from just over 40%, to now nearly 65%. This new product capability has been an important driver of Creaform's success. They have introduced a number of innovative new products, which help them penetrate new markets, and capture additional share in their existing markets. Most recently, Creaform's new lineup of quality control solutions were awarded the prestigious Red Dot: Best of the Best Award for their quality and breakthrough designs. For over 60 year, Red Dot has been one of the largest and most influential independent product competitions in the world. So, this is a great honor. Specifically, Creaform's products were recognized for their unmatched accuracy and reliability of the 3D measurements in harsh and unstable production environments. The new Creaform products recognized were the HandyPROBE Next, the MetraSCAN 3D and the C-Track. Within global end-market expansion, the Creaform team has done an outstanding job actively expanding and growing their strong market presence, and quality control, and reverse engineered into new markets such as non-destructive testing and healthcare. Creaform has also expanded their aftermarket calibration and repair capabilities globally to help further improve their value to the customer, to also leveraging AMETEK's global footprint to expand their direct sales activities in the US, Brazil, and Southeast Asia. I would like to congratulate the Creaform team for their tremendous efforts and outstanding success. They have created a truly dynamic business for the execution of our growth strategies. Now, let me take a moment to comment on current market conditions and their impact on our outlook for 2016. We fully understand and acknowledge the headwinds we face in this environment, given our mix of end-market exposures. These headwinds, especially within the oil and gas, and metals market have been deeper and more sustained than we initially expected when we started the year. Visibility has remained limited as customers are cautious and are aggressively managing their inventory levels and capital spending plans. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we believe the business has stabilized. We do not anticipate a modest second half improvement as we had expected, but rather believe demand in the second half to be largely consistent with the first half. As a result, we now forecast 2016 revenue to be down low single-digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic sales down mid-single digits. We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.32 per diluted share, down 9% to 11% from 2015's adjusted diluted earnings per share. Third quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down mid-single digits versus the third quarter of 2015. And we estimate our earnings to be $0.54 to $0.55 per diluted share. In summary, we remain focused on executing our four growth strategies despite economic uncertainty in many of our markets. We'll continue to aggressively manage our business in the short-term, while assuring we continue to make appropriate investments in our businesses to properly position us for 2017 and beyond. While we have short-term market headwinds, I am very bullish on the opportunity for AMETEK to drive meaningful earnings growth and shareholder returns moving forward. Our balance sheet remains strong. We generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our businesses are highly differentiated with strong market positions and excellent profitability. We have right-sized the cost structure and we'll realize meaningful incremental margins as the current market headwinds subside. Bill Burke will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be glad to take your question. Bill?
William J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Dave. As Dave noted, our businesses performed well in the quarter, meeting our earnings expectations and generating strong cash flows despite that difficult end-market conditions. I'll provide some of the financial highlights. In the quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the recent acquisitions. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.5% down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 27.7%. For 2016, we expect our tax rate to be between 26% and 27% as a result of the success of our ongoing tax planning initiatives. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventories less payables was 19.8% of sales in the second quarter, down from 20.8% in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million in the quarter and full year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $41 million for the quarter, and we expect full year depreciation and amortization to be $165 million. Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $189 million, up 16% over the last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was also strong at $175 million in the quarter, up 15% over last year's second quarter. And as a percent of net income free cash flow was a 126% for the second quarter and we expect the full year free cash flow to be 125% of net income. Total debt was $2.14 billion at June 30, up approximately $200 million from the 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $456 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 33.4%. At June 30, we had approximately $1 billion of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. We remain active on deploying our strong free cash flow with our highest priority for capital deployment being acquisitions. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we closed two acquisitions, HS Foils and Nu Instruments bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2016 to approximately $360 million. During the second quarter, we repurchased 417,000 shares of stock for $19 million and as well in the first several days of July, we repurchased just under 1 million shares of stock for approximately $45 million. In summary, we had a solid second quarter. We're well-positioned to support our growth initiatives with our strong balance sheet and cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Okay, great. Thanks, Bill. Hey, Brandi, we are now happy to open it up for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Yeah. So, I guess obviously tough end market conditions. But if I compare – the last time we had big end market declines back in 2009 to today, you held the line on margins much better then. I'm just wondering maybe, David, if you could just maybe compare and contrast 2009 to here, what led you to keep margins pretty flat to slightly up during that period. And obviously we're seeing a bit more pressure today.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. That's a great question, Nigel. You'll recall, 2009 was much different than it is in the current environment. All of the markets were down and we took action to deal with all the markets then it returned very quickly. But in the current environment, a couple of our markets are down, but some of our markets are hanging in there fine. So, the difference really is, it's a much slower market and the market has drug on for some time. And we have a much higher margin company right now. Remember that we were a mid-teens operating income margin company. Now we're much higher. And the two markets that are down, about 20% of our company, oil and gas and metals are down 30%. So, that's a difficult tailwind to offset, but we've done a good job to do it. We still have 22.4% operating margins and we had a good operating quarter.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. No, I understand that. And then, just maybe a related question, just thinking about your exports from the US. You've got a relatively high U.S. export exposure and I'm wondering the impact of the stronger US dollar particularly on your Process business what impact that's having on pricing within Process and maybe on top of that, any hedge impacts on margins would be helpful.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. Yeah. The question of price, across our whole business, we were up about 1 point and we had total inflation of a little less than that. So, it was still a positive contribution. We are seeing additional headwinds as you talked about, so, we call that flat for the year, meaning price will offset inflation. So, it's a different environment and our Process businesses, they were very successful in expanding in the emerging markets. Also, very successful in the oil and gas market. So, that is one point that we're seeing issues. Certainly, with a strong US dollar when we're manufacturing in the US, we see competitive pressure because of the strong dollar. There is no doubt about that. We are dealing with that by relocating to low cost locations and in most situations, we don't have competitors in different market segments that give us an advantage. But in terms of the translation and transaction effects, now we are in a relatively stable environment. We're not seeing much effect and you know we're naturally hedged in most of our markets. So, I hope those answers your questions.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Is the pricing flat? Or price cost plus the...
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, pricing is up a point across the business. And price, less total inflation, that's all costs in the business, is still slightly positive for the quarter. But our outlook for the year is calling price, less total inflation to be flat.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. How are you doing today?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Rob.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. A couple of questions. One, I think I it was customary in the past that Frank would kind of go through the state of some of the sub-segments in terms of what we're seeing, in terms of growth and just a little bit of more color. If you could do that kind of State of the Union for AMETEK, right now, that would be helpful?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, Rob. I'll start with EIG aerospace. EIG aerospace sales were flat as compared to the last year, as we saw continued strong growth across the commercial business that was offset by weakness in the business and regional jet market. For all 2016, we expect a similar trend to continue as the second quarter, with the commercial market being strong and offsetting weaker business than regional jets. This business continues to deliver strong new programs wins. These wins are across a wide range of platforms, including commercial OEM, business and regional jets, military. And year-to-date they have already won $230 million in life of program wins. So we're really excited about the new business we're winning in that market. And you know that's important for the future of any aerospace business. Next sub-segment where we process. Organic sales in process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, driven largely by weakness across our oil and gas business. Our Ultra Precision Technology business performed very well in the quarter. That team has done an excellent job managing the business. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for our Process business to be down to mid-to-high-single digits driven by the weakness in oil and gas. Going to the EIG, Power & Industrial sub-segment, we have overall sales for our Power & Industrial businesses were up double digits driven by the contributions of recent acquisitions of ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield, organic sales were down mid-single digits in the quarter. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down mid-single digits versus 2015, which Is unchanged from our prior forecast. So when you step back, in 2016 for all EIG, we expect overall sales to be down low-single digits, with organic sales down mid-single digits. And if we switch to EMG, first the differentiated parts of our EMG business, organic sales were down mid-single digits, driven largely by continued weakness across our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. We did see sequential stabilization in this business. However, the second half improvements that we had anticipated are going to be delayed and delayed out of 2016. As a result, we expect second half sales across our EMIP businesses to be largely flat with the first half. And for all of our differentiated EMG business we now expect organic sales to be down mid-single digits versus the prior year. And finally, our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business. Although a small part of the AMETEK, organic sales on our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were down low-teens in the second quarter as a result of softer demand across our key markets. And for all of 2016 we expect this business to be down mid-single digits organically as comparisons ease to the back half of the year. So, if you look at only EMG, we expect the overall sales to be down low-single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: And all AMETEK...
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: ... we expect overall sales to be down low-single digits and organic sales to be down mid-single digits on a percentage business. Hope that helps.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, it does. Thanks for that run through. I guess, the next question obviously is kind of cadence of M&A, size of M&A. I mean, obviously you have deployed a fair amount of capital here. You are in an environment where – I hate to typify it – but you have eroding fundamentals of the margin yet, very high equity valuations which would imply high valuations for deals in both the public and private markets. So, the bid ask is really kind of nettlesome at this point. I mean, do you think, this causes a challenge to transacting deals or deals of size? And how do you think about public deals because I think that was an area of potential opportunity for you?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Right, you have a lot of questions there. I'll try to unpack them. I think, the first point is we have four deals done this year, and we deployed $360 million in free cash flow. And we're about half way through the year, so we're pretty much online for what we're doing. So, we agree that the environment is tough, but we're still getting it done. The second point is, we're bullish on our pipeline. We talked about expanding our pipeline past a couple of quarters, and we're starting to benefit from the efforts of the pipeline identification efforts. And as you mentioned and recall, our sweet spot is that $50 million to $200 million deal. But we've expanded our horizons now, we're looking for deals up to $500 million in revenue, and we're looking at both private and public companies and we're really optimistic, because our pipeline is starting to reflect the efforts of the last couple of quarters as those businesses are working their way through the pipeline. So, in terms of the acquisitions, it is a tougher environment, we're getting deals done. We have a solid pipeline, we end up parsing those deals and selecting the deals to do that we can add the most value to and we're still very selective. And it is a key driver of our future value enhancement, so I'm really optimistic, we have plenty of fire power, $1 billion of capacity within our existing credit lines and cash on hand. More importantly, our operating cash flow is $750 million, free cash flow of about $670 million and I think this can be a significant driver for the balance of 2016 and 2017 performance.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Last question if you indulge me. In terms of the guidance for the full-year, you have visibility in kind of your end markets to the back half and some of the inventory challenges you've had in the stabilization. But, suffice it to say, you feel good about this guidance, is it conservative, is it unlikely we'll get another cut in the back half?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: No. There is not going to be another cut in the back half. We feel the business has stabilized, key markets, headwinds have stabilized, and our second half looks very much like our first half.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I'll leave it there. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Okay. Great.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning. And welcome to chair your first call, Dave.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Bill, as well Kevin. Unfortunately, it comes under not terrific auspices, but I certainly did like the answer to, or how you finished Rob's question just now. I guess maybe more surgically, I was wondering if you could tell us what were the pressure points on the second half effective guidance reduction here? What changed? You seem to have pretty good line of sight, you gave us some really good numbers in the first quarter as to why the guidance needed to come down. Could you maybe do something similar to that for the second half to perhaps make us feel as good as you feel about the full-year guidance at this point?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So there is kind of two questions there. One, really what's driving the takedown and why do we feel good about the stabilization. So I'll take the first point. Really, if you look at it, it can be explained really easily economically. Our organic growth is dropping 2.5 points versus the prior forecast or approximately $100 million. And it's really driven by oil and gas, and metals. That results in a 50% decremental. Oil and gas is one of our most profitable businesses. So if you take that $50 million and you look at the number of shares we have, it turns out to $0.16. So that puts you right in the mid-point of the guidance range. So that's what happens economically. When we look out for the balance of the year, really our EMIP business we thought that was going to pick up and now it's not. And we can talk about that a little more in a bit, but fundamentally we got comfortable with it because it's flat. We saw the same demand patterns in Q1 as we saw Q2 and we're forecasting that for the rest of the year. In terms of our oil and gas business, it dropped lower than we initially anticipated and we had modest improvements in that business and now we're forecasting it flat. And when we look at that business, we really think it's bottomed, based on what our customers are telling us, based on some of the commentary that you have heard from Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger where rig counts bottomed in Q2. So that business is down, but we think it's bottomed. To your point, how do we get comfortable with the stability in the year, I'll talk a little about the first half being the second half, being similar, and really embedded within our guidance is really our Q4 is really a carbon copy of what we just did in Q2. So we're not really forecasting a major uptick in the second half. In fact Q3 is down a bit seasonally because of some typical slowness that we've seen in Europe in the summer and we've normal seasonality in Q4, but really Q4 is very similar to Q2. And to your broader point about the forecast and then how we're accurate, why we feel more confident, many of you've followed AMETEK for quite a while and in the past our forecasting process has yielded very consistent results and it hasn't the last few quarters. And it's a difficult environment where we have visibility is weak from our customers and demand is weak in many of our markets, customers are delaying capital projects, customers are managing inventory aggressively, the emerging markets are challenged. But all that said, we have to do a better job forecasting our environment. And I asked Bill, and the Group Presidents to take a look at our forecasting process with a focus on making it more robust given the environment. So we took a different approach to forecasting, we got our entire executive office involved, we took a deep analytical review of each business to understand their forecast and to better assess potential risk. We had conversations with the financial community, so we understood what was happening. And although it was a more time-consuming process, we felt it was the right thing to do at this point. It allowed our executive office, which has a broader field of view than those of our P&L leaders running our niche businesses, who by definition are only going to see a more narrower view of the global economy. We took that broader view, we applied a consensus view of risk, it's reflected in our guidance and the final point, this is a rigorous process and I feel confident in the results.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Dave, that was very helpful. I very much appreciate that. But obviously the thing is, is that we – with the exception of the new rigor and the new sort of construct you have around the guidance, we did hear that in the first quarter, oil prices are now lower again, I know it's a small business but truck is falling apart. And then you have Brexit potentially affecting Europe. So if your reduction in guidance is only around oil and gas and metals, is there essentially a lift in the cost savings number to make sure you get there, that's kind of where I may be coming up short?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. Yeah, our cost reductions are $130 million for the year. So, it's the same number that we communicated last quarter and really on lower volume, we're purchasing less material, but we're confirming the $130 million number. So, the cost reduction is embedded in it. You mentioned Brexit, there is a situation where we are balanced in revenues and expenses. We have 5% of our sales in UK. We're balanced in revenues and expenses, so we have a natural hedge. So we're not going to have any transaction or translation surprise, so we have, expect a short-term impact to be minimal. We've been checking with our UK businesses on a weekly basis. So we haven't seen any downturn in orders yet, mainly because we're in a market that's not maybe tied to the consumer there. And you're right, longer-term impact; it will be driven with the economic growth, on the European and the global growth. And then, this uncertainty is going to go on for some time, but we're feeling pretty good about our exposure. And there are weak global macro conditions. I mean we highlighted oil and gas and metals, but certainly the global economy is not good, and you have the spillover effect from oil and gas into the other markets. So, all the markets are tough. Again, with the first half or the second half they're essentially carbon copies of each other and we are very comfortable with it.
R. Scott Graham - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. That's great, Dave. Thanks very much.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys, good morning.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Allison.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Dave, I just want to go back, you said, to sort of that metals commentary, I guess, high-level. I agree we would have thought that we would have seen improvement there, can you kind of walk us through what happened, what changed in that business that's driving sort of a lower expectation for the back half now?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Right, sure. First, let me take a moment, in this business, we take metals, metals such as Titanium, Vanadium, Cobalt, Nickel, Molybdenum and process them with very unique processing capabilities into specialty alloys, powders, components and we are very – we have strong niche positions and we feel very good about this business. What's happening is two things, visibility and inventory. In this business, we tend to be four to five levels removed from the ultimate end customer or application. So, as a result the visibility is limited and we can get misaligned with the broader end-market demand given the inventory buildup in the channel and we are seeing this play out right now. To give you a tangible example, we produce specialized master alloys which is a critical component in that the making of titanium parts for aircraft, we're one of the few producers who can make the specialized alloy, but – we're far down removed on the food chain. So, we sell to a titanium melter, who sells to an ingot maker, who sales to a part manufacturer, who sells to a sub-assembly manufacturer, who eventually gets on the airframe. So, we are quite a way removed in this business, different than most of our businesses. And we really, we identify some secondary inventory locations who have some inventory. So although the long-term demand for titanium master alloy, in this case an aircraft, is very strong with new aircraft using more titanium, the short-term demand for alloys has been impacted by this excess inventory in the supply chain.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Is there any sense of when that excess inventory would be cleared?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. It's not going to clear in 2016, but we're still bullish that it's going to clear and it will be in 2017.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you. That's helpful. And then on the new acquisition, you had talked about expanding it into the new market; can you expand on that, like where would that sort of a new market be for AMETEK?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Right. That's a great acquisition. We're talking about Nu Instruments and they are very analytical high-end magnetic sector mass spectrometers and the markets that we're in currently are similar to the markets that our CAMECA business is in, the research market and environmental, I mean in the environmental sciences, material characterization, nuclear. But the one new market that we're interested is, they have a new product that's in the food and beverage testing market. And the interesting thing about it, in the news, there is a lot of questions about food contamination and the interesting thing about the new equipment is it is so sensitive, and has a unique processing capability, it can actually tell if there is a contamination, and it's sensitive enough to tell where in the world the food is from. So we're very optimistic for the food testing market, and that business, if you take a step back, the business had basically one sales person. And they have great technology and we're going to plug it into our CAMECA business with a tremendous sales and service network and really optimistic about the potential for Nu.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's great. Thanks so much.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning, Dave. You referenced a bit of a 3Q step down clearly on the EPS. Is that all volume related and what exactly drives the step back in 3Q versus the kind of run rates for the year?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Right. Yeah. Its change from Q2 to Q3 can be explained by lower sales volume. So, our EPS is lower because of volume and typically we have a – Europe has some slower months and we have seasonality in Q3 that drops back a bit. And in Q4, there is really our normal seasonality. And as I said before, Q4 is really a carbon copy of the quarter, we just completed. So, we feel pretty good about it.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. It make sense. And then on the deals, I think you mentioned, a $150 million total sales acquired to-date, disclose Nu if I look at the first quarter deals. I think it all implies HS Foils is similar in size, do I have that right, to Nu.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think the numbers are wrong, it was a $115 million.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Oh, $115 million. Got it.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: So, what you really have with Nu – we've paid a price that was a little more than two times sales, close to two times sales. And the, it's nine times the first year EBITDA and HS Foils is smaller. It's significantly smaller. It's a technology acquisition, that's really going to help us drive organic growth and we're optimistic about it, but it's in the low millions of dollars in terms of the technology.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. That clears it up. Thanks.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. No problem.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Matt.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Just a follow up on the specialty metals business. So, and I certainly understand that these end-markets are fundamentally pretty healthy, so is this a permanent change in how the supply chain is managing inventory, or are there any competitive shifts going on here that are notable? And just, any permanent change in the level of activity in the specialty metals business?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: No, it's not a permanent change, Matt. I mean, it's an issue where the metals market that I talked before, about the complex supply chain, it's kind of in between us and really good end-markets. And that market is in – it's into stress right now. So the customers are managing their inventories for cash, they're being very aggressive in terms of working capital, but long term, we're very bullish. I mean, if you look at the titanium used in aircraft, if you look at – that's all growing with the A315 and 787, if you look at the other end-market applications in medical and specialized industrial, we're very bullish. I mean, certainly, we have a FX that's creating headwinds with that business along with some of our other business, but there really is no competitive dynamic that's major, and the market is going to return and we're going to have good businesses in good positions, and we just have to wait it out. And we – I talk a lot about the visibility and the inventory, but that's the key factor. It is not an issue where it's not going to come back.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you. And so, following up on some of the stabilization comments you made. You gave great insight around your level of conviction to that comment for oil and gas, some customer comments and actions, how about outside oil and gas? Any other – do you have orders or backlog or any other comments to give you confidence about stabilization ...
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: ... in the other parts of your business?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, our backlog is $1.1 billion. I mean, if we look at the run rates and we spend a lot of detail on it, it gives us confidence for the back half of the year. So again, we mentioned that the metals business is already performing from – and that's flat sequentially from Q1 to Q3. There's not much change in the other parts of our business. And there's not much change in the market. You really have a slow global macro environment and the two things we've been trying to get our hands around are really oil and gas, and metals, but the balance of the business is performing as we expected.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good morning.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Richard.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Dave, or maybe this is a question for Bill, but could you just explain the decremental EBIT in EIG? And roughly flat core sales, we delivered something like $9 million less of profit. Is that all mix shift with oil and gas being weak?
William J. Burke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think in EIG, we had a negative 6% core. So what you're seeing is roughly, I think it's a 50% kind of decremental margin in that business. You've got some of the higher margin businesses going down, and that's really what's driving the decline quarter-over-quarter in terms of the profitability in the business.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Another point I would add to that, Richard is, really as you think about what happened last year, our mid and downstream oil and gas businesses were still running very strong. So, you have that business as very profitable and now it has started down. So, that's a – one of the...
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: ...the profit impacts in Q2 year-over-year.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then I noticed from your comments, Dave, when you kind of laid out some of the sub segment expectations for sales, the cost driven motors business now is going to be down mid-single digits verus flat, but probably more to the point the EIG aerospace commentary suggests, the second half is flat and maybe the full year turns out to be flat versus – plus low single to plus mid-single. So has there been a down shift on the aerospace side in that regional bizjet market?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. The regional bizjet market, if you recall in 2015 we talked about some wins and new product wins and some retrofit opportunities and this year really in that regional business jet were down about 18% and you have some of the wins we talked about, I'll threw a couple of examples out with HondaJet. Well, we were design into the HondaJet. We're making significant shipment commitments, but the HondaJet has been delayed. So there is – that market is down. We were over performing in 2015 when the market was flat and we're really at the market levels but dropping back. And I point to some programs that are not repeating or delayed.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I see.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: The commercial market is strong and there is really no change in that. We have – there we have – if you look historically we're mainly a Boeing airframe company and over the past 10 years we've diversified our market to be even between Boeing and Airbus. So we're kind of don't care who wins, we win with both and we got more content on newer aircrafts. So even though the airframes are relatively flat, we're so growing in commercial and we feel good about that right now.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. And then just one, maybe a strategic question for you, Dave. As you kind of step in the role, and I know there is this kind of bullets flying all over the place here in terms of end-market conditions, but historically, AMETEK has targeted this framework where our core businesses and our core business prospects are kind of plus 5%, and then we're going to add 10% through M&A, but given where we are with the acquisitions over the last five years on the metals side, our oil and gas exposure was bigger than we had thought perhaps, but how do you feel about the next three years to five years, targeting a core growth rate for your current mix of businesses? I mean, should we think about that downshifting to more of a GDP number, and then we'll have fits and starts that maybe are plus or minus the GDP, is that a more realistic view, given the set of businesses, and the mix of business that you have kind of inherited and are now moving forward?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I see your point, it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in the first few years. And I did a lot of assessment of AMETEK's performance obviously, before I got into the role. And I'm a bit biased and look at our earnings growth through that – through the cycle of the last 10 years, we grew earnings 16% compounded annually. And I'd give our self a good grade for that, an A. Margins, same kind of thing, highest margins in the industrial space, cash flow generation has been outstanding, our return on capital well in excess of our cost of capital. And our capital deployment spend has been excellent. We're using our free cash flow to acquire good businesses and make them better. But in my role, dealing with your question, organic growth is important and certainly over the next few years when the environment can be slower, we can deal with flatter markets, and taken the current aftermarket headwinds aside with oil and gas, and metals, but separate from that, when we return to more flattish, stabilized markets, we need to adapt our strategy to the potential new reality in the marketplace. And really, when I look at it to ensure that we're going to be able to double our earnings over the next five years by low to mid-single digit organic growth and adding on acquisitions of 5% to 10% a year, we need to do a better job of organic growth. And in our organic growth, we've been average, we've been average compared against some good companies, but we can definitely improve. So we can do this under the construct of our existing growth strategies and expand our operational excellence toolkit and put more tools in that toolkit to focus on our sales and marketing processes. Really, making the front-end of our business as good as our operations. And that's going to be an area of focus for me and my team, and it's going to take some time, it's not going to be something that moves in the short term, but I'm confident they can get better. So we're focused on making organic growth better. To your exact question, I think in a slow environment, we're going to have to boost it a little bit to get that low to mid-single digit organic growth that will allow us to double the earnings of the company.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. All right. Well, thank you.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, Richard.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.
Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, and this is Akshay Bhatia on for Andrew. I just wanted to dig into your energy exposure a little bit, could you remind us what your exposure is between upstream, midstream and downstream after a couple of years of downturn, and maybe could you talk about some of the trends you saw over the course of the quarter, how April compared to June across these different business lines?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Right, it was difficult to hear you, but I think I have your question. Yeah, the oil and gas business as we talked before was lower than forecasted in Q2, but stabilized. So we saw orders in that second quarter that really matched our Q3 volume level. So we feel good about that. Coming into the year, it was about a $360 million business for AMETEK, about a third of that is upstream, a third of that is midstream and a third of that is downstream. The business is one-third in the US and two-thirds international. So we have a $120 million take down this year. So the $360 million is going to be down $120 million, that's about a third, and it's about $60 million down in upstream, and $60 million down the combination of midstream and downstream. So if you look at our upstream exposure, that's down about 60%, and our midstream and downstream exposure is about 20%.
Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And I know you talked about pricing overall being up 1% but maybe could you discuss pricing that you're seeing specifically in the energy market?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. The pricing in the energy market is below the average for the whole company. It's a very difficult environment. They've had to reduce costs to stay in business. We still can maintain pricing because we have very premier positions with niche-differentiated technologies. But it's certainly not at the AMETEK level on average and it's down a bit in the energy market, more in the upstream than the midstream and downstream.
Akshay Bhatia - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning, guys.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning, Bhupender.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Just on the orders growth here. Could you give us the number and organically what the orders growth were for EIG and EMG in the quarter?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Organic orders were minus 7%, so that was in line with sales. And our EIG organic orders were down 5% and EMG organic orders were down 9%.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And we have been talking about products in the end-markets. I think, I just wanted to focus on the geographic mix here, if you can give us some color how the emerging markets did actually in the quarter, because oil and gas is like two-third is international, just wanted to get a sense of how it did in like a Europe, Asia Pacific and outside the US, too?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, sure, Bhupender. I'll go around the world. In the US, we were down high single-digits versus last year. There are broader industrial weakness, but the key factors driving the negative growth were oil and gas and metals. In Europe, it's been – it was down low-single-digit. So we've been at that level for several quarters. Oil and gas impacted the region, but we don't have much metals exposure in Europe. And in Asia, we were down mid-single-digits and China was down mid-single-digits. So, there is a little bit of an improvement in China, there was a better trend for Asia where we were down double-digits for three quarters in a row and now we are down mid-single-digits and China was a negative for us. So, orders for the region, the entire Asia region were a little bit better than prior years. So, it seems to be that, that Asia is stabilizing, China is stabilizing and the one emerging market that I'd point out is doing better than the others is India, that's about the mid-single-digit growth, and it's a much smaller exposure but our investments there are paying off.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: And how should we think about how these markets would act or what kind of assumptions you have for the second half? Like which of these markets would be kind of remaining stable along the lines you just mentioned or they would deteriorate further?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. If I look at the trends in the US even though we're down high-single digits, it's slightly better from last quarter. Europe, that same trend is continuing and in Asia, we are improving a bit but really it's – we don't have anything factored in, it's really a down mid-single-digit. So, geographic-wise it's square with our concept of stabilization. I mean fundamentally our business has stabilized and then – and we are working on our earnings growth for 2017 now. We're focused on our business. We are getting ready to go into our budgeting process and that budgeting process that we go through in Q3 and spreads into Q4, there is really no area immune from efficiency improvement. We are going to look at things like global sourcing, low-cost region production, value analysis, value engineering, plant consolidations, engineering, all of the tools that we have and we are going to get a healthy cost reduction target. And we're going to pair that with acquisitions and that's how we are going to grow our earnings next year. So the geography is not a big factor in thinking through what we have to do for the balance of the year or what we have to do next year.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And if I go back like a few quarters here when Frank was there, he did mention that AMETEK could actually grow their margins by 30 bps to 40 bps I believe, if I'm right even in a declining organic growth sales. Now, how should we think about the back half of this year, are we – any assumptions here, where the focus will be more on the cost side as the macro is kind of...
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Right, right. For the year, we're saying operating income margins will be down a 130 basis points to 170 basis points. In the longer term – I mean given our high margin contribution margin businesses and given our operational excellence capabilities as far as the eye can see, when we get out of these market conditions and we return to internal growth we have the same 30 bps of margin expansion for the long-term.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay got it. And lastly, just wanted to tap into your oil and gas, you just gave a number of $360 million, is that company-wide, that's the direct exposure or ...
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. That's direct exposure, it's not indirect exposure, saw some impact in other markets that are not oil and gas related but that's a direct exposure and that will be done about a $120 million this year.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Right, that's what, I just want to get a sense of – because when we think of AMETEK we think of oil and gas to be about like let's say 9% of total sale, which is about like $360 million which we just gave.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: When we look at indirect exposure within EMRP and some other markets where oil and gas is definitely one of the markets where you're serving. I don't know if you've done some work internally to kind of give us a sense of what the indirect exposure would be.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: No – yeah, the total market exposure for AMETEK, most of it's in process. But, the total market expansion for AMETEK, exposure – going into the year with $360 million, that's the entire exposure. I was talking about the indirect exposure. For example, when you look at the helicopter market, I mean they're using helicopters to fly to offshore platform. So there's less demand for helicopters and that's in our business jet, regional jet segment. That's what we report it. So when I was talking indirect, I was talking about the total oil and gas exposure is the $360 million.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.

Frank S. Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered solid earnings in the first quarter, despite a very challenging global macro environment. Overall demand across a number of our markets remains weak. In particular, we’re seeing meaningful headwinds within our oil and gas and metals markets. These headwinds are larger than we anticipated when we started the year. Although these short-term headwinds are challenging, we remain confident in the long-term positioning and growth prospects for our business. Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references made to 2015 results, will be on an adjusted basis, excluding the realignment costs in 2015. Now onto the financial results. In the first quarter, sales declined 4% to $944.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%, acquisitions added 5%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind during the quarter. Operating income for the first quarter declined 12% to $208.5 million, and operating income margin in the quarter was 22.1% versus 24.1% in the first quarter of 2015. Net income for the quarter was $134.2 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.57 were down 10% over last year's first quarter, meeting our Street guidance. Operating cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 24% over the prior year. Now turning to the individual operating groups. The electronic instruments group reported a sales decline of 4% to $569 million for the quarter. Organic sales declined 8%. The acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield Engineering and ESP/SurgeX contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. The lower sales versus prior year were driven largely by our process businesses, which had exposure to oil and gas markets. We’re seeing incremental weakness above our prior expectations in oil and gas, both in the upstream, and in the mid and downstream markets. EIG’s operating income declined 12% to $141.8 million, and operating margins were 24.9% in the quarter versus 27% in last year’s first quarter. The electromechanical group reported overall sales down 4% to $375.4 million. Organic sales were down 9%. The acquisition of Global Tubes added 6%, and foreign currency was a 1% headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by the impact from commodity price deflation in our Engineered Materials Interconnect & Packaging Business, as well as from soft demand in our floor care and specialty motors business. EMG’s operating income of $79.4 million was down 10% from last year's first quarter, and operating margins were 21.2% in the quarter, versus 22.7% in the first quarter of 2015. I’ll now provide some updates on our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions. Each of these strategies plays an integral role in the overall growth and success of AMETEK. We’re focused on consistently executing on each of these strategies over the business cycle. However, in slow growth environments, we increased our focus on strategic acquisitions and operational excellence initiatives, while ensuring, we continue to make targeted investments in research and development and global expansion. First, let me touch on acquisitions. We’ve had a good start to the year, acquiring two businesses in the first quarter, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales. ESP/SurgeX is a leader in power protection. Their patent protected products operate at the plug level, and monitor, protect, analyze, and diagnose power-related issues remotely or on-site. In addition, their products help control power to mission critical equipment. ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Powervar business, providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. The company has annual sales of approximately $40 million and is headquartered in North Carolina. Brookfield is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control applications. The company provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers, as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield’s products include research, development, and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint, and petroleum products. The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. They’re headquartered in Middleboro, Massachusetts with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China, and India and have annual sales of approximately $55 million. The integration of both of these acquisitions is going very well. As part of our acquisition integration process, we conduct monthly integration meetings with each acquired company for at least the first six months following acquisition. These meetings are important drivers of the success of our acquisition strategy, as they allow us to closely monitor progress on key integration activities and value drivers during the critical early stages of the integration. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us. They will continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities. Our acquisition and business teams remain very active, and so we’re quite bullish on our opportunity to continue to deploy capital and create meaningful shareholder value. Now turning to operational excellence, our management teams and employees are doing a great job, driving continued operational efficiencies and improvements through their businesses by leveraging our operational excellence tools. Our operational excellence initiatives take on even greater importance, and become more of a focus in slow growth environments. For all of 2016, we now anticipate approximately $130 million of total operational excellence savings, with our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives driving approximately $60 million of the total savings. The total operational excellence savings is up from our initial estimate of $120 million, as a result of the continued strong efforts of our teams. Now moving on to new products. We are pleased with the continuous success of our new product development activities. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing and introducing exciting new products. These new product developments are targeted at both expanding in existing markets, and penetrating adjacent markets. Despite the slow growth environment, we continue to invest meaningfully in our new product development activities. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E, up 5% from last year. We continue to see excellent results from this investment, as our vitality index which measures revenue from products introduced over the last three years, was 22% of sales in the quarter. We have a number of notable new product introductions within the quarter. The new Xepos energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer from our SPECTRO Analytical Instruments business is considered a breakthrough product for performing elemental analysis. The compact bench-top unit incorporates a number of advances, that allow it to perform rapid multi-element analysis with greater accuracy and precision. The instrument's enhancements make it suitable for demanding environmental and geological research, as well as precise at line quality control in chemical and petrochemical production, food processing, and pharmaceutical production. The new Extreme Performance Series of MIL-XTM fans from AMETEK Rotron delivers best-in-class airflow for harsh and demanding military, aerospace, and industrial environments. The new fans feature shock proof Mil spec construction, and are optimized for electronic cooling applications. The fans are offered with a range of features that permit their use in a variety of situations and configurations. They can be used alone, or stacked with multiple fans to cool electronics, equipment racks, and personnel in airborne, land-based, and sea-borne installations. Our Zygo business provided high precision optics that were used in the recent detection of gravitational waves that confirmed one of the key predictions in Einstein’s 1915 general theory of relativity. The international team of scientists that collaborated on the discovery relied on advanced LIGO detectors that incorporated very high precision optical components manufactured by Zygo. The optics manufactured to some sub nanometer tolerances are among the most precise optics ever made. I’d like to recognize the Zygo team on their contribution to the success of this important global scientific project. Now turning to global and market expansion. Global and market expansion continues to be an important part of our long-term growth. In the first quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. We remain committed to expanding our presence in attractive higher growth regions and market segments through continued investments in our sales and service capabilities, and through the expansion of our technology into new adjacent market segments. I want to highlight one of the recent success of our adjacent market expansion initiatives. Our process instruments business has pioneered near infrared tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, or TDLAS technology. This technology has been very successful for use in online process applications within natural gas processing and petrochemical production. The process instruments business is now adapting to TDLAS technology for use in online pharmaceutical processing, through modifying its existing Model 5100 Series analyzers to provide continuous process control of pharmaceutical drying. The use of this technology as an online analysis tool, allows manufacturers to obtain a clearer picture of the drying process in real time. It is an economical and efficient technique for determining dryer endpoint detection, since it eliminates the need for pharmaceutical manufacturers to stop, analyze, and restart the drying process. The process instruments team is starting to see strong interest in this new market application for an existing technology. Now turning to the outlook for 2016. As a result of the end market challenges, we now anticipate overall sales for 2016 to be roughly flat versus 2015, with organic sales down low to mid single-digits on a percentage basis versus 2015. We expect earnings for 2016 to be in the range of $2.42 to $2.52 per diluted share, down 1% to 5% over last year. Our overall second quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single digits, versus the second quarter of 2015. We estimate our second quarter earnings to be approximately $0.58 to $0.59 per diluted share, down 8% to 9% over last year's second quarter. In summary, while the economic environment across many of our markets remains challenging and very difficult to predict, we remain focused on executing on the factors within our control. This includes deploying capital on strategic acquisitions, making growth investments in new product development and global expansion, and executing on our operational excellence initiatives. Our strong cash flow and prudent operating model give us confidence that we will continue our long track record of strong performance and shareholder value creation. Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be glad to take your questions.
Robert R. Mandos: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid first quarter. I’ll provide some further details. In the quarter, organic selling expenses on a percentage basis were down the line with organic sales on a percentage basis. General administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales in the quarter, slightly above last year's first quarter level of 1.2% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%, down from last year’s first quarter rate of 28.1%, and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing tax planning initiatives. For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we’ve said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from its full-year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables was 20.8% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital and management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. Full-year 2016 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million. Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $152 million, up 24% over last year’s first quarter. Free cash flow was $141 million, representing 105% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 120% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the first quarter, we deployed $300 million for the acquisitions of Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX. In addition in the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock for approximately $115 million. Total debt was $2.22 billion at March 31, up $280 million from 2015 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $386.9 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at March 31 of 35.7%. At March 31, we had approximately $900 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. This amount includes the incremental financing capacity provided through the amended revolving credit facility we announced on March 11. This amended facility increases with the size of our revolving credit facility from $700 million to $850 million and extends the maturity date to March 2021, provides AMETEK with a larger financing capacity, and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, our businesses performed well in the first quarter, despite challenging macroeconomic conditions. We are well positioned, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives.
Kevin C. Coleman: Great. Thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. Jenisha, I’d love to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg of Vertical Research.
Brian Konigsberg: Yes. Hi, good morning.
Frank S. Hermance: Hello, Brian.
Brian Konigsberg: Hey, I just want to start off, maybe just more of a conceptual question. So, Q1 March, this may be the second or third quarter in a row where you fell short of expectations, on an operational basis. Just thinking about how you’re thinking, when you go into the planning process for guidance, what is it that’s changed that it’s becoming a lot more difficult to guide in this market? We know obviously things are difficult, but we’re not used to AMETEK falling short, like it has over the last few quarters. Have you cut kind of too close to the bone potentially, where it’s becoming a little more difficult to guard against some of the shocks in the market, or are there other issues at play that you could maybe discuss?
Frank S. Hermance: No. The key factor here is, it surely it’s not in terms of anything we’ve done in terms of cost reductions, et cetera. The key issue is that we’ve exposure on both sides of our Company to markets that are in a pretty significant downturn. Oil and gas is a major part of our Company, and we’ve just seen over the course of the last several quarters, that it has deteriorated further than we had expected. You may recall that we had called oil and gas, in terms of the downturn last year. When we called it in January, we hit it right on. But this year, we did not hit it right on, and the conditions are worse. If you look at oil and gas, we initially thought for 2016 with respect to 2015, we would be down around $50 million. Our best look now is down around $90 million and that changed. There was an inflection point actually, right around the time of our last earnings call, when oil hit $26 a barrel. And when that happened, we just saw a large number of projects just move to the right and that we were actually anticipating that we were going to get sooner. Most of those projects are still going to happen. But they're going to be moved, and probably moved, many of them into next year. So we miscalled that particular business. And it’s simply because the changes have been so dramatic, and it’s very difficult to predict them. It has really nothing to do with how we're operating the Company itself. It's just predicting the future is not an easy thing. And I’d say, similarly, if you look at the other side of the company with EMIP, with the issue with metals pricing, and the deflation that happened, and we talked about this in the fourth quarter. In a way, a similar thing happened that when metal prices went down so drastically, the buying levels from our customers just went very, very soft and have remained soft through the first quarter. And now the good news, in that particular market is we’re starting to feel improvement, where actually our order intake is improving. So we actually believe that one will improve as the year goes on. But we are not predicting that the oil and gas business will improve. So this is really a market related issue, with dramatic changes on each side of the Company, that’s causing this problem. Now given that and the contribution margins of our businesses, we are actually quite pleased with the operating performance in terms of profitability. We met our first quarter guidance on profitability. Margins, although down a bit, are still extremely good, one of the better ones in the industry. So we’re managing a difficult situation, as well as I believe anybody could manage it so, but that's fundamentally what happened. I hope that helps.
Brian Konigsberg: That is helpful. Thanks, Frank. And maybe just secondly and obviously there are a lot of numbers that are going into this, but I don’t know if you could simplify it. When I just look at your bridge, talking about flat sales for the year, obviously 4%, 5%, 6% -- percentage points of acquisition contribution, organic down. I presume there hasn't been a change in the assumption on price and inflation. I guess, price is offsetting inflation by a modest amount still. And then you're talking about productivity savings of $130 million. I still have a hard time kind of bridging the guidance to the new range that has been provided. In fact, I'm actually coming above the range. So, when I think about, when I put together the qualitative components, I'm coming out to an EPS that should be higher than where you're guiding. I thought that, probably for the last four or five quarters, and clearly that didn’t materialize. But I was just curious if there are -- maybe you can kind of walk through some of the components that get you from the 2015 EPS, to the -- to your new guidance of, the new guidance range that you provided today?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, actually you can view it in relatively simple economic terms. The organic growth, if you look at the entire company, and you look at it for the year, we think we, and our guidance assumes, that we’re going to be 2 points less on organic growth. And that’s as a result of the two factors, predominantly that I talked about in answer to your first question. You take 2 points on a $4 billion company, that’s $80 million. $80 million, the detrimental -- excuse me, they are detrimental too. Detrimental margins of this company, similarly to when they got, when volume goes up, are on the order of greater than 45%, roughly 50%. So just take the $80 million, multiply it -- I’ll take -- make the numbers easy, 50%. You’ve got $40 million of pre-tax operating income. And that’s $0.12 or $0.13 a share. Yes, we haven’t put it through more cost reductions, about $10 million of additional cost reductions, over what we talked about last year -- or last quarter, excuse me, and you take that. And what happens, in many businesses, when the economic environment gets tough, is that basically people buy lower in the product portfolio. So that the overall sort of mix of the Company, for lack of a better word, goes down a bit. And that has, in essence, offset that $10 million of other cost improvements. In terms of price and inflation, what we told you at the beginning of the year, was that we expected price to essentially offset inflation, and that’s still our expectation. So that is a very high level look. Obviously, there are puts and there are takes. But that’s the overall thought process. And you take that, and that is the reduction in the guidance essentially.
Brian Konigsberg: And the investment spend of $60 million …
Frank S. Hermance: It’s $60 million on investment, absolutely. We have not changed the investment spend. So we’re continuing to make the investments, so that when we get some market lift, the contribution margins are obviously going to be extremely high in the other direction, and we are going to make a lot of money.
Brian Konigsberg: Understood. Thank you for the detail. I appreciate it.
Frank S. Hermance: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance: Hello, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: On the energy side, Frank, let me just ask you -- I know historically you’ve had some level of visibility, and that’s fallen off again pretty dramatically with -- which is what happened last financial crisis. I guess, what's your confidence, now that we are sort of modeling this well, as we are -- as we stand today. Obviously, oil is a little better right now, but I guess your confidence and just thoughts on the visibility as we move through this now?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure. It’s a great question, and we’ve asked that same question of ourselves, a number of times over the last few months. We are giving this our best shot. And from everything we know in talking with customers, and also quite frankly in listening to some of our peer companies, I believe right now, we got it called right. And we have not assumed any improvement in oil and gas as the year goes on. The levels are low. It’s hard to believe they could get a little bit worse, but we also put a range on our guidance. So and the guidance, just to be very clear, the guidance is balanced both ways, plus and minus. It’s not a conservative estimate. It’s what we really believe is going to happen. And if things do get a little weaker, we are going to be at the low end of the guidance. If things get to be a little stronger, we are going to be at the high-end of the guidance. So, we think we’ve got it. But predicting the future is not an easy thing to do, but with our best people and our best thought process and it’s fairly consistent with what other companies are saying. The only release that I saw that hinted at improvement in oil and gas, at the latter part of this year was in GE's report. Just about everybody else, at least the ones I listen to, and I don't listen to that many, maybe four or five, we’re predicting pretty much what we’re predicting.
Allison Poliniak: Okay, great. And then, just RD&E on a high level, up 5%. In this kind of environment, does the bar get set higher in terms of what you're investing in? I mean, any change to sort of the process now, in sort of a softer versus stronger market for you?
Frank S. Hermance: It’s, probably the last expense in the Company that we do not like to touch. It’s so critical to our future, in terms of -- as you know the level of technology in our products is quite high. And if you make dramatic cuts in that cost, you are going to hurt yourself. You won’t see it for two or three years, so you could improve the short-term performance of the Company, but not the -- you just don’t want to sacrifice the long-term. So we’ve not made any substantial changes in that number. It’s the same number that we talked about at the beginning of the year, and it’s also up over last year by that 5%. It is a lever that we’d have if things did by any chance get any worse. But again, we don’t anticipate that at this point in time.
Allison Poliniak: Great. Thanks so much.
Frank S. Hermance: You bet, Allison.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of Alembic.
Nick Chen: Hi, guys. This is actually Nick Chen for Matt this morning. Thanks for taking our call. I was hoping that you could just talk a little bit more about total and organic orders, in terms of the backlog, and what we are seeing for book and bill?
Frank S. Hermance: Sure. Book and bill in the quarter was 1.02. Orders overall, were up 3%. Organically, they were down 8%.
Nick Chen: That’s very helpful. Thanks so much. And then, just finally, can you talk a little bit about the M&A funnel. And just -- I know you sort of got into a little bit earlier, but just sort of your thoughts on the ability to deploy meaningful capital in regard to the balance sheet of 2016?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, we feel real good. There is a high likelihood that we are going to be able to deploy a sizably larger amount of capital as the year goes on. We have actually beefed up our energy on the acquisition front. We’ve set up a couple other teams within the Company to look at opportunities. We are working with external advisors, and we’ve got a lot that’s in the pipeline. They are varying sizes from the smaller deals like the two we talked about earlier in this meeting to the larger deals. And I would say, it’s probably one of the top priorities of the Company right now. We have got extremely strong cash flow, and we believe that this is the best way for us to create value for our shareholders, while our markets are in a depressed condition.
Nick Chen: That’s great. Thanks so much guys. I will jump back into the queue.
Frank S. Hermance: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets.
Frank S. Hermance: Hello, Matt.
Matthew McConnell: Good morning, guys. Just to touch on the guidance reduction, so $40 million is probably half or a little bit less than half than the guidance reduction, that’s the oil and gas piece. So what …
Frank S. Hermance: No. No, that’s not right.
Matthew McConnell: What’s that?
Frank S. Hermance: No, that’s not right. No, you take $40 million, this is pre-tax, $40 million at the pre-tax level that goes to the bottom line at about $0.12 to $0.13.
Matthew McConnell: Okay. On the revenue side, just going down to flat versus prior outlook for up low single digits, I was figuring -- that’s about $100 million on revenue. And if oil and gas is $40 million, there is another bucket there that got weaker, is that …?
Frank S. Hermance: Oh yes. No, okay. Now I’ve got your question, yes. No, it’s the other part that I was talking about. On the EMG side, with the metal price deflation that I talked about, that’s the other $40 million. So the total is not $100 million, it’s about $80 million.
Matthew McConnell: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance: The contribution margins are a bit different between those two $40 million. That’s actually higher on the oil and gas businesses, and a bit lower than the 50% number that I was using in EMIP. So you take the $80 million times the 0.5 you get basically $40 million of pre-tax. And that’s what I thought your original question was, and that’s how you get to the $0.12 to $0.13 number.
Matthew McConnell: Okay, great.
Frank S. Hermance: Does that help?
Matthew McConnell: Yes, it does. I’m thinking more along the lines of strictly end market weakness and top line weakness, what changed since February? And just getting at what might have gotten worse, besides oil and gas but …?
Frank S. Hermance: Well, it is what I said in response to Brian, is that also the metals deflation in EMIP was deeper than we had anticipated, and it’s also slower coming back. Now we’re seeing a trend where it’s starting to come back. But it’s not coming back at a rate that we think could achieve the original guidance. And that’s why we also reduced that part of the Company by the $40 million. So it’s a double hit. That’s what’s happening here. I mean, it’s pretty simple actually. We got a hit on the oil and gas and EIG, and a hit on EMIP on the metal side, and that’s the core issue of what we are dealing with.
Matthew McConnell: Okay, great. Thank you. And just on the, you mentioned a greater importance put on the operational excellence initiatives, and that’s up a bit, but the contribution would still be less than what you saw last year and I’m wondering if that’s a realistic expectation, given the incremental effort that you are putting on those [multiple speakers] initiatives?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. Let’s -- yes, right. If you remember last year was -- and we said it when it happened, it was an exceptional year. We did several restructurings last year. One in the first quarter of 2015 and another one later in the year. So yes, that number last year was bigger, but I hope we set the expectation that was not the run rate. And what we are doing now at $130 million level, we think it’s pretty darn good, and we feel great about it. And it comes back to one of the original or initial questions that, you don’t want to destroy these businesses. These are phenomenal businesses, and you don’t want to go in and take so much cost out, that you then will not be able to recoup. So we think we’ve done the appropriate amount, we are pleased with it. You can see it in the overall performance of the Company. And we are talking about earnings being down here, if you take the average of our estimates about 3%. So, it’s not like we are going to be down 10% or 15% on earnings. So we are actually pretty happy with that, although I know it’s not good from the change in guidance viewpoint.
Matthew McConnell: Yes. Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets.
Scott Graham: Hi. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance: Hello, Scott.
Scott Graham: Hey, Frank. I wanted to maybe slice this organic sales question a little bit differently. If we were to maybe pull out oil and gas and EMIP, it looks to me like your organic still would have been down, let’s call it 4% to certainly 5%, which is a third deterioration in the last three quarters, which of course includes those numbers as well. But the point, of course, is that the $80 million if you straight line it, it’s still kind of looks like organic was weaker than certainly I’d have expected. And so, I guess, my question is, one of your four operational model points, legs of the chair, if you will, is in fact new products. And had there been thought given to maybe finding a way to bump up the cost reduction target a little bit more to let’s say fund a little bit more organic growth? Because there has got to be some reason why that the organic has been kind of stubbornly weak for really six quarters now. So I was just wondering what you were thinking about terms of your model, tweaking it to promote more organic?
Frank S. Hermance: Well, I mean, you look basically at our strategies and clearly RD&E and global and market expansion are definitely focused on the organic growth side of the business. If you look at the organic growth of AMETEK, and Kevin has done this analysis over the last -- almost any period you pick, say a year, three years, five years, and I think he even had a 10 year chart, our organic growth lines up quite well with our peers. But obviously when you’ve got the impact of these two market conditions that I’m talking about, it’s not -- just not -- you can’t overcome that is basically what happens. Your number, if you really look at it, isn’t as significant as you think. It’s not a 4% to 5%. It’s a lower number than that. But it’s running slightly negative I’d say, for the rest of the Company, and that’s what’s in our guidance. But the overwhelming impact is really from those two areas, and that will change when those markets change. So in terms of tweaking the model, yes, we do that all the time. And as I mentioned to Allison’s question, that’s why we are keeping the RD&E expense up, when the top line is weak. And sure we are doing everything we can, to help the organic growth picture of the Company. And we are continuing to invest in higher growth regions of the world, and those are really the two key drivers to the organic side of the question.
Scott Graham: Got it. Thank you, Frank. And I was wondering, if you could do your typical across the business divisions’ summary for us?
Frank S. Hermance: Sure, Scott. I’d be glad to do that. So, let me start with EIG. EIG aerospace sales were down low single digits against a difficult comparison in last year’s first quarter. We had very good growth in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket business in the quarter. But it was offset by a difficult comparison in our business and regional jet business, which you may recall was very, very strong last year. For all of 2016, we expect EIG aerospace sales to be up low to mid single digits, again driven by strength in our commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket businesses. Our process businesses, organic sales and process were down about 10% in the quarter, reflecting obviously what we’ve talked about in terms of greater than expected weakness in our oil and gas business. And as I mentioned, while some of the incremental weakness was in our upstream business, project delays and push outs also impacted our mid and downstream business. And as a result, for all of 2016, we now expect sales for our process businesses to be down mid single digits organically. And the last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. There we had a solid first quarter. Overall, sales were up 10% driven by the contributions from the acquisitions of ESP/SurgeX and Brookfield that I talked about in my opening comments. Our organic sales were down low single digits. And for all of 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down a mid single-digit number. So if you sum that all up for EIG, we are expecting overall sales to be roughly flat. And that’s obviously driven by the acquisitions of Surface Vision, Brookfield and ESP/SurgeX with organic sales down to the mid single-digit kind of region. Moving to the other half of the Company, Scott, in EMG and the differentiated side, organic sales for our differentiated business were down high single digits versus the first quarter of 2015, driven largely by weakness across our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging business. And the weakness, as I’ve already indicated, was really due to the impact of commodity price deflation. However, here we do expect sequential improvements over the rest of 2016, and we are really basing that on current order trends which have strengthened, and thus we really do expect a stronger second half than first half. So if you sum all of that up for the differentiated piece, for all of 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses organic sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year. And the last and now much smaller part of our Company, Floorcare & Specialty Motors, they were also down approximately 10% in the first quarter as a result of softer global market conditions. And for 2016, we expect sales for this business to be roughly flat organically versus prior year. You take those two parts of EMG, so overall then for EMG we expect overall sales and organic growth to be roughly flat versus 2015. And then lastly, obviously, you sum EIG and EMG, and that’s where we get to the flat overall sales, and organic sales down the low to mid single digits on a percentage basis.
Scott Graham: Thank you, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance: Hey, you bet, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy of Stifel.
Robert McCarthy: Good morning, everyone.
Frank S. Hermance: Hi, Robert.
Robert McCarthy: So, a couple questions here. I mean one question that’s come up from an investor is just thinking about and maybe drilling down on this question about the size of deal. I think investors have been concerned about perhaps in the context of a lower structural organic growth and some of the challenges there, that doing a larger deal is kind of a priority, just given the law of large numbers. And could you just talk about your capacity to do a deal now, of what size, and then ultimately how you think about your funnel? I know you did allude in previous comments, how you are looking at a variety of deals. And then, clearly there is a priority, all things being equal to do a larger deal. But could you just talk about that, particularly, in the context of -- I do think you brought up your revolver and your leverage a little bit this quarter. So, could we get a sense of what is kind of the outward bound of your capacity right now?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure. You’ve got a bunch of questions in there. Let me start with what we consider a larger deal. First of all, we’re not looking at mergers of equals here. If you look at most merger of equals, they don’t create shareholder value. So, when we look at the size of deal that we’re focused on, it’s really between in volume between $50 million and a couple of $100 million. And if a larger deal comes along, up in the $400 million or $500 million region, we’d consider doing that. In order to meet the model that we’ve discussed with you, where we basically want to achieve on a yearly basis -- it’s not going to be every year, but on average 5% to 10% of our sales coming from acquisitions, that’s the basic model we’ve talked about for years. You take the upper end of that and its $400 million. We are $4 billion right now, so you take the upper end of 10%, you need to do $400 million in volume. And there is different ways you can say, what’s the purchase price based on that, but you take $400 million and multiply that by maybe 1.2 or 2, say 2, just to make the numbers easy, you got to deploy $800 million a year in capital on average to make -- to get to the high-end of that range. What’s our capacity? Right now our capacity is -- with everything we’ve got, we’re well in excess of $900 million in capacity. But more important than that, if you look at the free cash flow of the Company, the operating cash flow is going to be this year, on the order of $775 million, which means the free cash flow, we’ve our CapEx set around $70 million, is around $700 million. So -- and when you buy companies, you get an EBITDA stream. So, basically we could easily deploy $1 billion plus, probably a $1.3 billion. I haven’t run the numbers recently without affecting significantly the leverage of the Company. We will remain investment grade. That’s absolutely our thrust. We don’t intend to float equity. We don’t need to based on the numbers that I just told you. So we are in a great position. Now if you look at it from the viewpoint of capacity, from a management viewpoint, the way we’ve put the -- made changes in the Company really over the last number of years is to basically put enough resource in the Company, which is already there now, it’s already done. So, that we could handle three deals a year or three deals simultaneously, excuse me. And if you take on average how long it takes to do a deal, it means you could easily do 10 deals a year, probably even do a few more than that. The key point is we don’t have to do that larger deal. We can get to that $400 million number by doing a bunch of smaller deals. But on the other hand, if we can find something, and we’ve looked at a few and we are actually very close on one or few quarters ago that we talked about, that’s larger we will do that. So we are not management constrained. We are not financially constrained from a cash flow viewpoint, and it just comes down to finding really good companies. And we’ve got a lot of effort going in, and the backlog is good. We are looking at deals. I can tell you that Dave and I are involved in deals on a daily basis. And I can’t tell you exactly when the next one is going to close, but I can tell you that we are fairly optimistic that we are going do well. And that’s the best way that we can take the strong cash flow of the Company, and create value for you. So I don’t know if I’ve answered all of your questions. I tried to bundle them altogether, but did that get at them?
Robert McCarthy: That’s encyclopediac. Thank you for the full response and for the audience, we didn’t collude on that question, because it was a very well scripted response. In terms of two other points, one on restructuring, I mean, do you think we will continued to see call outs here going forward or just given, I mean, how do you think about the sense that what’s ongoing and what should be just built into your earnings base, just cost of doing business, [indiscernible] what you do versus [indiscernible] fortune?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, that’s -- we think of this number of -- I will call it a $100 million plus. We are at $130 million now. That’s what we think we can do on a year in year out basis. We’ve put the infrastructure in the Company to do that and we believe that can continue for a substantial amount of time. And the majority of that is sort of built into our revenue and our guidance, as we give it to you guys and ladies. And the reason for that is the structure that we’ve put in place. As you know we’re an operationally focused Company. So, in terms of just our normal operational excellence strategies, we can get $50 million to $70 million a year. And in terms of our materials strategy, we are in that same ballpark, and therefore, that’s an ongoing cost. In terms of any, what I would call major restructuring of the Company, no. We are not envisioning that, and we’ve to modify these strategies as time goes on. And I will give you an example and Dave maybe you can speak to this, that on the material side, we had to change the strategy a bit and we’ve done it incrementally over the last number of years and we’ve added a value analysis tool into our toolbox. And Dave, why don’t you speak to that a little bit? You’ve really led that activity and done a great job with it.
David A. Zapico: Sure. It really comes down to getting that $50 million a year of cost savings that you talked about. And for some of our maturer businesses, where we’ve already globalized the supply chain, we really focused on charting the bill material from an engineering viewpoint. So, we’ve taken our bill of materials focused on the highest cost items and used both our engineering capability and supply chain capability to attack that, and very quickly go through projects than we are introducing cost out designs in a matter of three or six months. And we’ve done that across the Company, and we’ve institutionalized it as one of our operational excellence tools. And that was the largest driver of our material cost savings. So, if you think about we bring a new company in, we go after the supply chain hard and we get big savings. We often can take 25% out of the company’s material costs, because of our global sourcing. Well, if we owned the company for 5 or 10 years, we’ve to find other avenues to take material costs out and that’s where the value analysis, value engineering comes in, and now let’s institutionalize across the whole business. And as I mentioned, it’s the largest driver of the material costs now. So we are very happy about that.
Robert McCarthy: Thanks for your time.
Frank S. Hermance: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra of Jefferies.
Bhupender Bohra: Hey, good morning, guys.
David A. Zapico: Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance: Good morning.
Bhupender Bohra: My question, Frank, if you can give us some color on the BRIC countries, the global [technical difficulty] especially China. What you assume …
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, yes. Good news and bad news is the best way to say it. Overall, BRIC countries organically were down 8% and China was the driver down about 9%. If you look at the other countries, Russia continues to be weak, Brazil weak, but actually a little bit better than it was doing in terms of decremental organic growth versus last year. But obviously, the driver here is China and I should mention India is good. That’s the one that was good last quarter and it remains good. We had mid single-digit kind of organic growth in India.  The good news is that we are feeling a stabilization in China. And if you look at the numbers we’ve provided over the last three quarters on China, they are not the best in the world, but the key thing is the orders in the first quarter were flat organically. So -- and in talking with our people there, they’re feeling a bit of stabilization, I would say, is probably the best word. So we are feeling a little bit better about China, but obviously, the BRIC countries, which for a while for us were growing at 25%, 30% overall are now more of a challenge. But hopefully, what we saw in orders in China is an indication that things are going to get better there.
Bhupender Bohra: Okay. So just a follow-on, on the energy business here. You talked about the shortfall of $40 million. Can you give us some color into upstream, the midstream, and the downstream portion? And where did you …?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, basically if you look at -- you are talking about the incremental $40 million that I talked about. It was evenly split between downstream at about $20 million and the combination of upstream and downstream at -- or upstream -- yes, upstream and downstream at $20 million. So, $20 million in upstream, $20 million in the combination of mid and downstream. I don’t think I said that right a moment ago. Okay. And then, between upstream -- between midstream and downstream, it was more downstream oriented.
Bhupender Bohra: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance: Okay.
Bhupender Bohra: And the other $40 million on the metals business, now I thought when we saw the commodity kind of prices jump in February, that your customers would have actually come into buy the metals, but I don’t know what …?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, here -- it’s a great question, absolutely a great question. And the issue is what metals are key to AMETEK? And in our case, the key metals on the EMIP side are molybdenum trioxide, cobalt, vanadium and to a lesser degree nickel. And if you actually look at those three metals, they are down and they have not come back. And that’s why, when they do come back, our customers -- right now, they don’t want to buy when they are very low, right? So, we don’t have an impact on our cost, because we pass basically the price of the raw material on. So we are not sort of -- we don’t have an issue from that viewpoint. The issue from us is when metal prices are very low, our customers are just going to hold off as long as they possibly can and before they start buying, and that’s what’s really happening right now. And it was -- and the fact that those metals have not rebounded yet, is the issue. So you can’t look at us in terms of the standard metals that you think of.
Bhupender Bohra: Okay, right. Thanks a lot.
Frank S. Hermance: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.
Frank S. Hermance: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher Glynn: Hey, good morning. So, question on the full-year guide versus the first half. It looks like we are implying a couple points of margin improvement in the second half versus the first. That’s steep, so just wanted to get some thoughts, get my brain around that?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. We feel pretty comfortable as we move through the year in terms of the improvements. And I’m going to talk sort of about the overall improvements in EPS, and there is three drivers for this. The first is that in our process businesses, there is a seasonality impact of several of our non-oil and gas related businesses, where they always have a stronger second half than first half. The second thing is that in one of our oil and gas divisions, thermal process management, they’ve actually won market share with a good share of that improvement from the market share gain viewpoint already in backlog. And they’ve done that really through several initiatives. The first was increased penetration in the Middle East, and also a partnership that we’ve with Pentair. So, the first factor is, we expect the process businesses to have some improvement because of those factors. The second factor is what we’ve already talked about in terms of EMIP, that we believe that situation, and we are already seeing it in order intake, will have a gradual improvement through the year. And therefore we will see incremental improvements from that volume, and we are very confident in that. And then, the third thing is really the cost improvements. And if you look at how the cost improvements layer in, they become much more significant in the latter quarters in the year. So you take the organic growth of the first two reasons I outlined, and obviously when that goes to the bottom line, that improves your margins, because of our very high contribution margins. And then, you put these incremental cost improvements through the business. That’s why we feel those margins will in fact improve.
Christopher Glynn: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance: Does that help?
Christopher Glynn: Yes, that’s helpful. And then, in terms of M&A, I think you did mention a heightened focus on energy related assets, in particular. So, if I heard that correctly, I’m wondering how you match that focus up against, maybe gauging the risk of a commodities super cycle that could be a mirror image of a 10-year emerging markets boom?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, our focus is to fundamentally buy good businesses. We’re not afraid of buying a business, when it’s in a down cycle. We believe oil and gas is going to be a good place to play on the longer term, and we’re in a substantial down cycle. Now is oil going to get back to $125 a barrel? No, I don’t think so. But I think it’s reasonable to assume that it’s going to get back to a healthier level, so we’re not afraid to buy assets. And you can get extremely -- potentially extremely good pricing, because you’ve got businesses in distress and -- but it’s not, I wouldn’t say, we are focused on oil and gas, and I don’t think I’ve said that. I just said, we -- we are not afraid to buy a business in a down cycle. Actually, you’ve there almost a reverse problem. If you are in a very strong up cycle, and you look at the sellers who are selling that business, they of course will take where they’re at the top of the cycle, and say they’re going to grow organically from that point, and they will never put a cycle -- down cycle in their estimates. So, you got to be careful on that side of the equation. So, we always put cycles in our acquisition models. We actually have an approach, where we can do Monte Carlo analysis and change the magnitude of the cycles, change the timing of the cycles, et cetera, so that we make sure we are paying the correct amount for the assets.
Christopher Glynn: Okay. And I know it’s getting late, but last quarter you kind of pushed us to the low-end of the guidance, that proved prescient. Any way we should handicap the current range?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I mean, that’s a great point. And if you recall, what I said at -- in one of the questions that one somebody asked in this meeting, right around the time we released guidance, I don’t remember exactly when oil hit $26 a barrel, but we were starting to feel that. And so therefore when I came out or we came out with guidance at -- a quarter ago, I pushed you towards the low-end, and I did that, because of the concern that did in fact materialize. I’m not sure; I think I’ve ever done that before in my 16 years of being a CEO. Normally we come out with a very balanced view on the guidance, not trying to push it one way or the other. And as I’ve already mentioned on this call, the guidance we are giving you now is balanced. In other words, we think there is as much upside potential, as there is downside risk. So, if things are weaker than what I’m saying, you could end up at the low-end. If things are better, you are going to be at the high-end. So it’s a balanced view and it’s not weighted in either direction. And so, which is much more consistent with what we’ve done in the past.
Christopher Glynn: Sounds good. Thanks.
Frank S. Hermance: All right.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen.
Joe Giordano: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Frank, I just want to clarify, did you mention earlier, in the Floorcare business, you mentioned down 10% organic in the first quarter and then expectation of flat for the full-year.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes.
Joe Giordano: So can you kind of talk us through where -- how you are getting to bridging that?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. That’s real simple. The second half of the year, last year was very weak. So the comp [indiscernible] easier.
Joe Giordano: Okay, easy enough. And then a question on the guidance. Just I know we’ve talked about this a lot, but when you gave your initial guidance, and you were pointing us to the low end, were you contemplating like a second half appreciation in underlying markets that just didn’t materialize or …?
Frank S. Hermance: No, it’s the reverse …
Joe Giordano: [Multiple speakers] further.
Frank S. Hermance: No, it’s the reverse. It’s really what I talked about in answer to the first question. It’s that oil and gas and the impact of metals deflation got worse. And I was feeling that around the time of the call, but we were unable to quantify it, because the market -- both of those markets sort of just clammed up, is what happened.
Joe Giordano: Yes, So both guidance kind of ….
Frank S. Hermance: I did the best I could to try to give you the best call I could give you, with what I knew at the time. [Multiple speakers] guidance. I mean, we did make our guidance so.
Joe Giordano: Right. So, but it’s fair to say that both guidances had a flat trajectory from point A, it’s just it’s a lower starting point now?
Frank S. Hermance: I think that’s fair.
Joe Giordano: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Frank S. Hermance: I think that’s fair, yes.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.
Nigel Coe: Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance: Hello, Nigel.
Nigel Coe: You’ve covered a lot of ground so, and certainly …
Frank S. Hermance: That’s for sure.
Nigel Coe: A couple quick ones. So, you took up your revolver in mid March from $700 million to $850 million …
Frank S. Hermance: Yes.
Nigel Coe: … and is that a signal of maybe size potential, maybe you need to see in the M&A backlog or was it -- am I just reading too much into that?
Frank S. Hermance: Well, there is a couple factors and that was surely one of them, that we have a lot of banks who are willing to give us a lot of funding. So, we took advantage of that. But also you don’t like the term of your revolver to get near the end. You’ve better negotiating power when you’re not at the end, and so that also entered into this. And there are some signals that at some point in the future, interest rates are going to go up. So you are just in a better negotiating position. So that’s -- I mean, really those two factors that drove it. Bob, I don’t know if you have anything to add?
Robert R. Mandos: No, I totally agree with what you said, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance: All right.
Nigel Coe: Okay, great. And the message on M&A is obviously very clear, but the stock price is down this morning. Is there any bias towards buying back stock at these levels versus M&A?
Frank S. Hermance: The bias is definitely towards M&A. I mean, we’ve said and said repeatedly that the best way we create value for our shareholders is by buying companies and making them better, and that is the primary use of capital. Having said that, we will do opportunistic buybacks of stock. And I think Bob mentioned in his report that in the first quarter we did some. It was 2.4 million shares and we may very well continue that, but I don’t want to imply that that’s going to be a primary use of our cash. We can create better value for you, by buying companies and improving them.
Nigel Coe: Okay. Very clear, Frank. Thanks.
Frank S. Hermance: Okay, Nigel.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I’ll turn the floor back over to the presenters for the closing remarks.
Frank S. Hermance: Great. Thank you very much, Jenisha. Thanks everyone for joining the call today. A replay will be available on AMETEK.com and StreetEvents.com,. And as always, I’m available for further discussions today. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s call. You may now disconnect.

Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered solid operational results in the quarter to complete another strong year. We achieved a record level of operating income, operating margins, and diluted earnings per share in 2015 despite a very challenging global macro environment. Looking ahead, we expect these difficult conditions to persist in 2016. Therefore, we have taken additional realignment actions in the fourth quarter to help minimize the effects of the ongoing global softness. These realignment costs totaled $20.7 million or $0.06 per diluted share. And we expect annualized savings of approximately $35 million as a result of these actions with an approximate $20 million benefit in 2016. Before covering the financial results, please note that any references to 2014 or 2015 financial results will be on an adjusted basis excluding the realignment cost in 2015 and the Zygo integration cost in 2014. Now, on to the fourth quarter and full-year results. In the fourth quarter, sales were $988 million, down 4% from last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales were down 4%, acquisitions added 3%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. Operating income in the quarter was $229.5 million, down 1% versus 2014's comparable quarter. Operating income margin for the fourth quarter was very strong at 23.2%, a 50 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the quarter was $150.7 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were flat with last year's fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, sales were $4 billion, down 1% versus 2014. Operating income was a record $944.3 million, up 3% from 2014. And full year 2015 operating margins increased 100 basis points to a record 23.8%. Diluted earnings per share were up 5% over 2014, ending the year at $2.55 per diluted share, a record level. Now, turning to the individual operating groups, the Electronic Instruments Group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. For the quarter, EIG reported sales of $628.4 million, down 2% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was down 2% while the Surface Vision acquisitions added 2% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. Solid growth in our Aerospace and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses was more than offset by weakness in our upstream Oil & Gas business as a result of the continued slump in oil prices. EIG's operating income increased 2% to $170.9 million, and operating margins were superb at 27.2% in the quarter, a 110 basis point improvement over last year's fourth quarter. The Electromechanical Group managed well through a very difficult market environment. Sales were $359.6 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's comparable quarter, with organic sales down 8%. The acquisition of Global Tubes contributed 5%, and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. The lower sales were driven largely by the impact from commodity price deflation in our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging businesses, as well as soft demand in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business EMG's operating income of $70.9 million was down 8% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating margins were 19.7% in the quarter, down 60 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Now, turning to our four growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. In 2015, we acquired two businesses, Global Tubes and Surface Vision. We deployed approximately $360 million of capital, and acquired roughly a $180 million in sales on these two acquisitions. 2016 is off to a solid start, as we announced today the acquisition of two additional businesses, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories and ESP/SurgeX. Combined, we deployed approximately $300 million in capital and acquired nearly $100 million in sales. First, I will touch on Brookfield. Brookfield Engineering Laboratories is the global leader in viscosity measurement instrumentation for quality control application. Brookfield provides a complete range of viscometers and rheometers as well as instrumentation for the analysis of texture and powder flow. Key applications for Brookfield's products include research, development and production of food and beverage, pharmaceutical, paint and petroleum-type products. The addition of Brookfield allows AMETEK to expand our laboratory instrumentation platform into a broader range of adjacent markets and applications. Brookfield is headquartered in Middleboro, Massachusetts, with additional operations in Germany, the United Kingdom, China and India. The company has annual sales of about $55 million. Now, let me touch on ESP/SurgeX. They are a leader in power protection. Their patented protected products operate at the plug level and monitor, protect, analyze and diagnose power-related issues remotely or onsite. In addition, their products help control power to mission critical equipment. ESP is a great strategic fit with our existing power protection platform. It is highly complementary with our recently acquired Powervar business, providing us with new opportunities for product innovation and market expansion. They are headquartered in Knightdale, North Carolina, and they have annual sales of approximately $40 million. Over the last 24 months, we've acquired eight businesses, deployed over $1.1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $510 million in annual revenue. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us throughout the year, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially in low growth environments. Acquisitions will also continue to be the primary use of our strong cash flow and financing facilities, which gives us ample liquidity to continue the strategy. Now, turning to Global & Market Expansion, we continue to invest in the development and expansion of our global sales channels, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long term growth opportunities. In the fourth quarter, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. Our Ultra Precision Technologies division continues to see great results from their global expansion investments with mid-teens organic sales growth across Asia in the fourth quarter. Their Taylor Hobson business delivered excellent growth in China and India in the quarter, following recent investments to expand their sales and service infrastructure in these two key markets. Also, their Creaform business continues to see great growth internationally, with double-digit growth in Asia in the quarter. This growth is being driven by continued development of their sales network across Asia and from strong expansion in the quality control market driven by a number of recent new product introductions. Now, moving on to new products. Our businesses are doing an outstanding job developing new products to serve their existing markets, and to help penetrate adjacent markets and applications. We have consistently invested in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers. As reflected in our vitality index, we continue to see excellent results from these efforts. Revenue from products introduced over the last three years was strong at 26% of sales in the quarter, up from 25% in the last year's fourth quarter. In 2016, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E or about 5% of sales. We're excited about some recent new product introductions. Our TMC business, a leader in precision vibration isolation systems recently introduced the Everstill K-400, a compact vibration cancellation system. The Everstill is ideal for small vibration-sensitive instruments such as optical microscopes, scanning probe microscopes and metrology instruments. Its patented vibration cancellation technology is especially suited for the 1 hertz to 10 hertz vibration range where precision instruments tend to be the most sensitive. The portable Everstill is ideal for bench tops and worktables as it requires only a standard AC power outlet. The LEAP 5000, the latest generation of atom probe microscopes from our CAMECA business was recognized by R&D magazine with an R&D 100 Award. Widely recognized as the Oscars of innovation, the R&D 100 Award is presented annually to the 100 most significant new developments in research and development as determined by an independent panel of judges. This product was recognized as a breakthrough instrument whose unique capabilities have enabled engineers and scientists to gain new insight into materials and processes. Lastly, AMETEK Power Instruments recently added an IEC version of their JEMStar II electricity revenue meter for use outside North America. The JEMStar II is the most accurate revenue meter on the market with the broadest communication options and features the industry's first color graphic display. The meter is specifically designed for applications with a high electric usage such as utility generation and transmission substations I will now touch on operational excellence. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continued operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the operational excellence tools we have put in place throughout the company. In slow growth environments, the success of our operational excellence initiatives takes on an even greater importance as we are able to drive meaningful margin expansion while continuing to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall, we realized approximately $150 million in savings in 2015 through our various operational excellence initiatives. The largest contributor to these savings was our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities where we recognized approximately $75 million in savings for all of 2015. For 2016, we expect approximately $120 million in total savings through our operational excellence initiatives, including $60 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives Turning now to the outlook for 2016, we do not anticipate a meaningful change in global economic conditions in 2016. We expect sluggish conditions across oil and gas, emerging markets and the broad industrial markets to continue. As a result, we anticipate 2016 revenue to be up low single-digits on a percentage basis from 2015 with organic growth down low single-digits for all of AMETEK. Earnings for this year are expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per diluted share, probably focused more on the lower end of that range and that's flat to up 4% over 2015. First quarter 2016 sales are expected to be down low single-digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings in the first quarter to be approximately $0.56 to $0.58 per diluted share versus $0.63 in last year's first quarter. So, in summary, our overall business performed well in the fourth quarter and for all of 2015. We delivered record operating results in 2015 despite persistent global economic weakness. Our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to continue to invest in our businesses and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our strong portfolio of businesses and commitment to driving success through our four growth strategies should enable us to continue to deliver strong and consistent long-term growth. Before turning the call over Bob Mandos to cover the financial details, I wanted to note that Bob has decided to retire effective May 15 of this year. Bob has done a tremendous job over his 35 years of service with AMETEK and he will be greatly missed. I want to thank Bob for all his contributions to AMETEK and wish him all the best in his retirement. Bill Burke, who many of you know, will be assuming the CFO role on May 15. Bill has also done a superb job for AMETEK over his 28-year career and is well suited for his new role. Now, Bob, if you could cover the financial details. Please.
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a good fourth quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, selling expenses were down roughly in line with sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in the quarter, unchanged from last year's fourth quarter level of 1.2% of sales. Other expense in the quarter was up approximately $6.3 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014 due to an insurance gain in last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26% versus last year's fourth quarter rate of 27.1%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing international tax planning initiatives. For 2016, we estimate our tax rate to be approximately 28%. As we had said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19% of sales in the fourth quarter down slightly from the third quarter level. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $69 million for the full year. Full year of 2015 capital expenditures were 1.7% of sales. 2016 capital expenditures were expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $40 million for the quarter and $150 million for the full year. 2016 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $165 million. Our cash flow was very strong in the quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $199 million and free cash flow was $176 million representing 128% of net income. Excluding the $50 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan in the first quarter, full-year 2015 operating cash flow was $723 million and full-year free cash flow was $654 million or 111% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In 2015, we spent the $360 million on acquisitions and thus far in 2016, we have deployed approximately $300 million on acquisitions. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of stock to approximately $130 million. Total debt was $1.94 billion at December 31, up approximately $230 million from 2014 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $381 million resulting in net debt to capital ratio at December 31 of 32.4%. At December 31, we had approximately $930 million of cash in existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had a strong 2015. We are well positioned with strong balance sheet and cash flows to support our growth initiatives.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. Thank you, Bob. Frank, we're now happy to open up for questions.
Operator: Thank you.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Frank, we would like to open up for questions now.
Operator: Thank you.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Operator, are you there? Okay, one moment, while we check on the status of our operator. Okay. So those people on the call, one second. We're going to have to work with the operator to get him back on the line.
Operator: Our question comes for the line of Matt McConnell from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I'm not sure if you're on it. I can't hear a response, but I'll just go ahead with the question in case it's going through. I wonder if you could add any visibility around maybe your conviction for the 2016 outlook? I know you're already talking it kind of to the low-end of expectations, but just how do you about planning in an environment like this where it's probably hard to tell whether things are getting incrementally worse or not? I'll just leave it at that. Thank you.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Hi, everyone. This is Kevin from AMETEK. The operator is dialing back in so we should get started back up here in a minute or two. Thanks for your patience.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, please continue to stand by. Your conference will begin momentarily. We thank you for your patience. Okay. Our first question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sorry for what occurred, Matt. I don't know what the technical difficulty was. It was not on our end, so.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. No problem at all. Just hoping to get some visibility around your conviction on the 2016 outlook. You're already setting expectations kind of for the low end. Just how do you go about planning in an environment like this where it's probably hard to tell whether things are getting worse or flattening out. Just any more insight into how you plan in that kind of environment and level of conviction?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean, it's very difficult as you stated. There are a lot of moving factors right now in the global economy. And in Q4, we had some difficulty in our EMIP metals business, and that will continue into Q1 which is one reason why the Q1 forecast is lower than we would have liked. So, to get conviction, it's more difficult in this environment. And that's why I mentioned in my opening talk that with that sort of cloudy outlook, it's probably best to be conservative on the guidance that I gave.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then switching gears a bit just to the M&A that you announced.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: What are the EBITDA multiples and maybe margins now versus margin potential of these businesses. And what's your playbook for creating value on these deals?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, absolutely. The Brookfield deal, we paid about 11 times and the ESP deal we paid about 10 times. We see significant synergy with these businesses. If I look at the ESP deal, their margins are quite good. However, we can offer significant amounts of synergy in terms of international expansion. They don't do a lot outside the United States. And also, just our normal operational excellence initiatives can definitely create value. Our goals and how we price these deals, we look for a 10% return on invested capital in year three. Both of these deals actually exceed that so we're pretty confident of getting a good return for our shareholders. Following up on Brookfield, Brookfield is just a phenomenal company. Their name is well, well-known in the industry and it's almost synonymous with rheometers because they basically have a very, very strong position in that market. And their margins are lower than the AMETEK margins so we believe over time, we can definitely put our operational excellence capabilities in place there and move those margins up to the AMETEK average and possibly beyond. So we're pretty excited about both of these deals. Obviously, doing deals is the primary use of our cash flow. And we're going to continue to make acquisitions throughout the year and we think it's a very significant value creator for our shareholders.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Yeah. Morning. A couple of questions. First, with respect to EMG being down 8% organically in Q4, I would assume that sort of caught you by surprise. Can you talk about within EMIP or maybe even just walking through the other businesses in EMG, how much of the decline are you experiencing there that's really volume-driven versus price and/or commodity deflation driven? And I guess, when do we anniversary that commodity deflation as it sort of flows through your P&L?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Matt. You're right. That was the surprise in the quarter. EIG came in essentially where we were expecting. But what happened during the Q4 is that there was a significant decline in metal prices. A few examples are nickel was down 13%. Copper just in the quarter was down 17%. And vanadium was down 23%. Now, in terms of how that affects the profitability, we pass the commodity prices through so that there's not a major impact from the viewpoint that the prices came down from that perspective. The issue is that because the prices were coming down and so rapidly, our customers basically stopped purchasing. They wanted to make darn sure they were purchasing at the bottom instead of at a different – higher level. So the impact here was, therefore, on the sales line from the view point that they essentially stopped buying. And that is continuing into Q1. We expect some stabilization in Q2. And I'm probably – a pretty sure bet would be by Q3 that those – that will stabilize because in essence those customers need the product. I mean that's the fundamental issue. So they'll drive their inventories down to where they're as low as they can be. And then they'll be forced to basically go ahead and purchase. So I think that covered all of your questions, Matt.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Yeah. Thank you. And then one quick follow-up. Just on Oil & Gas, as you entered 2015, you threw out some numbers, I think, down 10%. Is that where it sort of ended up for you guys? You were able to sort of get that right, I guess? And then what are you looking at there for 2016 on an incremental downdraft basis and also pulled in how mid and downstream impact that as well as upstream?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Okay, Matt. We definitely got it right in 2015. We made that call right at the beginning of the year and in essence, when we look at the results for 2015, we hit it right on, which is almost unbelievable that we were able to call it as close as we did. Looking forward, what we're expecting, if you look at the total linkage that we have to oil and gas is about $360 million. Of that, about a third is upstream, so say, $120 million, and we're projecting that piece to be down around a third, around 30% to 35% which is down an incremental $40 million. And then if you look at the remainder, which is mid- and downstream, we expect a mid single digit type decline. So overall, what's in our forecast is an incremental $50 million of decline due to essentially the price of oil being down at the $30 a barrel level right now.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC: Great. Thanks a lot, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, you bet, Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Andrew.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Just a question. This has been a very confusing earnings period, I guess, for me. When was the last time outside of a recession you remember that your businesses sort of could not grow organically? And what are you guys just seeing on a broader economic sense because some companies are talking about things re-accelerating into the first half of the year? Just sort of, if you can take a longer historical perspective first and, b, just to talk about the fact that some people are sort of calling for re-acceleration and some people are not?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, I think it depends on the particular markets in your particular business concentrations. I think if you look back historically where AMETEK has had, say, negative organic growth is typically when the industrial cycle is down. And in my view, we are in an industrial recession right now. That's the view that the consensus of all of our managers is that we are in an industrial recession. And therefore, to get any sizeable organic growth in this environment is challenging. And where AMETEK shines is that we're able to be very good on the cost side of the business and therefore, we are looking to be able to hold or slightly increase our earnings in a recessionary environment. So that's probably the best I can say and if companies – I'll give you some examples without specific names, but if you have a company that doesn't have oil and gas exposure or doesn't have a lot of exposure in Asia or in metals areas, those companies are going to have a better opportunity to grow organically and that's probably why you're hearing some of this, I'll call it, confusion in the market. When we step back and we look at these kind of environments, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business and we're going to look to deploy capital to increase our earnings. And remember, the guidance that I'm giving does not include any future acquisitions. So whatever we can do to deploy more capital and bring more companies into our realm. We've got the operating capability that we've shown over many, many years and over a period of time, we always create value. As a matter of fact, the way I view this environment right now is this is a buying opportunity for AMETEK. We very seldom have a dip like our stock is experiencing right now. And I can tell you, I'm going to increase my ownership. So that shows some commitment.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just to follow-up on that, I had breakfast today with somebody a lot smarter than I am. And the question was about sustainability of this M&A driven model versus 10 years ago and I know what you think, but it's interesting that this earnings season, the companies that have disappointed investor expectations actually where these sort of high quality companies with heavy emphasis on M&A model. What do you think about your actual ability to reaccelerate M&A in this environment?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think it's super. I think what we're going to see because we're in this slowness in the industrial economy is we're going to see a lot more properties becoming available. There will be an exodus of companies where they want to sell because they don't want to wait out until market conditions get better. And we have the capital, we have the management talent. So to me, it's one of the two pillars in terms of buying companies right now. I think we'll see the multiples start to come down. As a matter of fact, I heard Bill Eginton in a recent board meeting, first time say he's seeing multiples start to come down. So that's a good sign as well. So we're going to be aggressive. You take advantage of this on the acquisition side, and you focus on cost. There isn't a lot you can do about the global macro. So you just – you sort of have to wait that out. And when they come back, the earnings of this company are going to skyrocket. So I mean, that's the best way I can describe the situation. I know it's difficult for all of us, including yourselves, to really get a handle on exactly what's happening. But that always happens in a recessionary environment. I hope that helps you.
Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much. No, this is great. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Joe.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Frank, just to follow up on that M&A comment you made. Looking back at how active you were on the acquisition front last cycle, you closed a lot of deals in 2008. That was just ahead of the downturn. And then 2009 was one of your lightest years in terms of deal flow. Does that make you at all hesitant to get overly aggressive right now ahead of perhaps a worsening macro outlook? Or maybe you can be more opportunistic? I mean, it doesn't sound like it, but what are your thoughts there?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think the downturn in 2008 and 2009 was clearly an abnormality. And the reason is that the whole economy was just crashing. Everybody just stopped is the best way of saying it. And because nobody knew where bottom was and, I mean, that was a different kind of recession probably than I've experienced in my business career. So, yes, your historical picture is exactly right. However, this recession what I'm saying we're in now is different. It's not as deep start there. And I think in 2008 and 2009, I don't remember the actual numbers, but I think we were down about 15% or something of that magnitude. We came back. We came back very strong right after that. But this is not of that magnitude and you can see that in our guidance where we're talking about organic growth for 2016 being just down low-single digits. So it's not anywhere near a significant an issue. So I would not use that as a model. Actually, if you go back to the previous recession, before that, we did buy companies in that downturn. So that's why I think this is just an ideal opportunity to be aggressive. And I don't mean aggressive in the sense of buying companies that are not good. I mean we've got the capital and we've got the manpower. And, I don't know, we're going to continue to look at companies. We're actually pretty happy that already this year, we've announced deployment of about $300 million in capital. And as I said in my opening comments, over the last 24 months, we deployed $1.1 billion in capital. So I think it's going to continue. And I can't sit there and tell you exactly what we're going to acquire and what the capital outlays are going to be. I'm just telling you from a strategic view point, it's a good time. That's probably the best way that I can characterize it. So Joe, I don't know if that helps with your question.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. No, that's helpful. Thanks, Frank. And then in terms of your outlook, the low-single-digit organic growth, how do you see that between segments and – maybe it makes sense to do the business rundown in terms of what you're seeing in the segments or what you saw in the quarter and then rolling that up into the guidance?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure. I'd be glad to do that, Joe. So let me start with EIG and Aerospace, EIG Aerospace had a strong fourth quarter, with organic sales up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, reflecting strength. And, actually, all parts of that business, commercial OEM, business and regional jets, and our military business, believe it or not. Our EIG Aerospace business had an excellent year as they gained sizable new content on a number of attractive platforms. In 2015, they received a record $620 million in life of program awards on 35 different platforms and that included Rolls-Royce for the Trent 7000 engine on the A330neo; Parker Hannifin, for fuel systems on the Joint Strike Fighter; and GE for the GE9X engine, which will be on the new version of 777. So they've done a really, really good job of getting content. Of course, when you're on these airplanes, that content lasts for 20, 25 years. So looking to 2016, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up low- to mid-single digits and that's why the continued ramp-up of key commercial OEM platforms and some growth in business and regional jets mainly due to our content on new aircraft and, in particular, the HondaJet. Moving to our process, organic sales and process were down mid-single digits in the quarter, obviously, driven by weakness in upstream oil and gas. As I mentioned a moment ago, the weakness in upstream Oil & Gas in 2015 was in line with our expectations at the start of the year. And for 2016, we expect sales for our process instruments to be down low to mid-single digits organically, driven by continued weakness across upstream Oil & Gas. The last part of EIG is Power & Industrial. Their organic sales were flat versus last year's fourth quarter with solid growth in our Programmable Power and Solid State Controls business offsetting weakness in our Power Instruments business. And also, for this business, in 2016, we expect organic sales for Power & Industrial to be down low- to mid-single digits. So then if you look at all of EIG where you got Aerospace up and both Process and Power & Industrial down slightly, if we then look across all EIG, we expect organic sales to be down there, low to mid single digits, with overall sales up low single digits really due to the acquisition of Surface Vision, Brookfield, and ESP/SurgeX, with obviously these last two deals being announced this morning. So that's our outlook for EIG. Moving now to EMG, and I'll start with the differentiated part of EMG. Organic sales here were down mid single digits in the quarter driven, as we have talked about, by weakness in our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging business. And this is again a result of the commodity price deflation that I talked about. And for 2016, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to actually be flat organically with the impact from commodity deflation within our metals business being mostly pronounced in the first half of 2016 which is again what I said in answer to one of the questions. And then the last part of EMG is Floorcare & Specialty Motors, they were down actually mid-teens organically in the fourth quarter as a result of softer demand globally. But we actually have a pretty good outlook for that business. We expect the sales for the business to be roughly flat organically. We've won some content on new programs, and our managers are doing a great job managing that business. So that is the present outlook. So if you sum that up for EMG, overall sales are going to be up low single digits, just like EIG. And in this case, it's driven by the acquisition of Global Tubes on the acquisition side. And for organic sales, we expect to be down low single digits. And that, if you roll up then to answer your question for AMETEK as a whole, we're expecting overall sales could be up low single digits and organic sales to be down low single digits. That's our best call at the present time. And if I can give you some flavor on our guidance, our guidance assumes these organic growth numbers that I just talked about. And the reason I pushed a little bit to the lower end is that I don't see as much upside on organic growth as possibly we could have some downside and that's just because of the fogginess right now of the environment. It's the best way that I can say it. And I'm trying to be accurate and tell you what my best thoughts are.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I appreciate that. Thanks, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Frank, could you provide us with the order number in the quarter?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure. Orders were down 4%. It was $966 million. Do I have it right, guys? $966 million.
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Right.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I got it right. And I'm not looking at anything.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And what's the – can you give us a sense of the core order number?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Core was down 6%.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): 6%? Okay. And then also, it appears that at the midpoint of guidance for 2016, if I kind of walk up the P&L, midpoint of EPS guidance, I walk up the P&L.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, sure.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): It looks like maybe the EBIT margin is around 23%, maybe at the midpoint?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We're projecting EBIT margins at the midpoint to be up 20 basis points to 30 basis points even though it's going to be weaker obviously in the first part of the year. But obviously, we are putting those cost improvements that I talked about through the business, and they will have a greater impact obviously on the second half than the first half. So, overall, we're talking 20 basis points to 30 basis points up.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. And just maybe the last question, could you just give us – and maybe this is just – on the Aerospace business for 2016, just kind of the four components there. Are all of that, all of the components, third-party service, defense, commercial and bizjet, is there any difference there? Are they all kind of up low-single, up mid-single? Anything on the...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. That's true. Your statement is very accurate and you look at – the surprise here, and I've said this before is that our military business is actually doing quite well. Some of that is not U.S. military. It's outside military, outside the U.S., and that's doing quite well. As I mentioned, business in regional jets, the market is not recovering. At some point, it will. People have been projecting an upturn there for the last five years, probably, and it hasn't happened. But we've won really good content on – in that segment. So we're thinking that one will be okay. And then commercial, the key there is the new aircraft. And we had very good content on the new aircraft. And so we see that, yeah, I think your basic comment of low to mid-single digits is accurate.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. And then just last thought, I understand that commodities pass-through pricing. But exclusive of that EMIP business, were you able to capture any pricing in the fourth quarter and would you expect positive price capture in 2016?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: In that business, the answer would be no.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Correct. Yeah.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Because one of the advantages and disadvantage of pass-through is when prices go down, customers – we pass that through. And then when they go up, just the reverse happens. So you sort of can't have it both ways. And so there will not be anything from that viewpoint. But as people start seeing metal prices go up, they're going to refill their inventories, and you're going to have a recovery of the impacts that we're seeing right now. So I mean, the dynamic is more in the customer buying pattern due to price than it is in terms of the inflation effect on our P&L. Does that make sense, Rick?
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): That's okay. But the question is maybe a little bit around outside of that business. Are you seeing any...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Oh. Okay.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): ...competitive pricing outside of that business?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Oh. Okay. I am sorry. I misinterpreted your question.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. That's okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Okay. No. Let me give you some data. In the fourth quarter, for the whole company now, price minus inflation was about 0.2%. Price was about 1%, inflation, on everything now. I'm including wages, everything, all in, was about 0.8%, so that we got 0.2% of sales to the bottom line in the fourth quarter. What's in my guidance and in our guidance, I should say, is that price minus inflation will be flat.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And again, we're looking at the global macro. And we're just not going to assume that we're going to get any pricing above inflation. But we have a lot of pressure on our operating managers to, at a minimum, cover inflation and maybe we'll end up with some positive there. But that's what's included in the guidance, Rick.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. This is Drew on for Nigel.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Drew.
Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Frank, just going back to the orders real quick. I think in 3Q, you had mentioned that sequentially the orders have actually picked up from July through September. Could you just give us a sense for how things tracked through 4Q? And then what you're seeing in January to-date because we're hearing some commentary that, from some distributors that things are picking up?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Through the quarter, actually, our orders did go up. So we had a very strong last month in the quarter. So that trend was definitely there for all of AMETEK. And that also is during this time when I was mentioning the impacts of deflation. I would say in January, no, I have not seen a pickup. But, it's hard to conclude anything from that because our orders tend to be weaker in the first month in a quarter than the third month. But I can clearly tell you, I'm not sitting here with a euphoric outlook that things are getting better.
Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just one more on the – regarding your comments on still wanting to be aggressive on M&A and valuations potentially coming in. Do you have a target or sort of a max level on leverage that you'd be willing to step up to?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Leverage is just not an issue for us. You look at where we stand right now, and our net debt to EBITDA is around 32%. It's up a little bit from last year. Our debt to EBITDA was at 1.8 times. We could easily lever up to 2.5 times, which is a significant amount of capital deployment and remain investment grade. And so we would never go to the point where we are not investment grade. So capital and leverage is not the determinant in our acquisition strategy. It's finding really good businesses like the two we announced this morning. And we just have the capital to deploy and I just don't have to worry about leverage. I mean, just to give you another statistic with the budget or the guidance I gave you. The operating cash flow of AMETEK will be about $800 million. Our capital deployment, as Bob indicated in his talk, is going to be in the $70 million, $75 million region. So the free cash flow, and I don't know whether your percentage was in there, Bob, it's about 119% of net income. So you can just see that the cash flow of the company is incredible, and that's why acquisitions are very important because we think that's the best utilization of capital to get you a good return.
Andrew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Very helpful. Thanks.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Brian.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Hey, I just wanted to touch a little bit more on the guidance, especially just with Q1. I know you talked about the deflationary impact on the order trends and presumably the margins with overhead absorption, but, I mean, it does seem like it's – the margin does come down even a couple hundred basis points year-over-year. And then just kind of talking about the comment with margins for the year up 20 basis points to 30 basis points. You have to have a pretty good level of expansion by the back half. Am I actually reading that correctly? And if there is any commentary on the trajectory? Thank you so much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Your reading is definitely correct and when we look at the first quarter, there's the oil and gas market, our business. We were depleting backlog last year which obviously it's been now down at a low level. So, when you look at first quarter-over-quarter, you're going to have an impact there plus this material deflation issue that we've talked extensively about. So the first quarter is going to be tough and that's the reason why we decided – we saw this coming obviously. And that's why we decided to do the restructuring or realignment, I should say, where we put a major cost savings through the P&L. And, obviously, we're not going to get significant benefit from that in the first quarter. And, yes, as we go through the quarters, that is going to have a sizable impact. And there's another factor in here, too, and that's that the comps get easier as you go forward, too, overall. So, you get a little leverage from the sales line. But your outlook and your high-level thought process is right on.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And just separately on the restructuring. So the payback seems particularly high. I think it was 150% conversion with the math you provided. Can you just talk about why the payback really is so good? Is there something specific about what you're doing that is just that productive?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. I would say this is somewhat normal for us, this kind of payback. And I'll give you a high-level view that we're obviously going to do some employment reductions. It's not major but definitely we're going to be doing some, and we're going to be closing some plants. And I don't want to talk about the particulars, but this is standard AMETEK, I would say, where we are able to continue that operational excellence capability that we have. So, yeah, you look at the returns whenever we do this and they're usually very, very good.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: If I could sneak one last in? Just on the RD&E. So you're keeping that fairly consistent. Can you talk about where you see particular opportunities to kind of improve the product line and essentially kind of extend your capabilities?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No. That's a good point. I mean, we're basically going to invest, as I said in my opening talk, $210 million. That's up about 5% from last year. And it also just coincidentally happens to be about 5% of sales. So it's a very healthy number. And we feel this is the organic pipeline of the company. That investment will go more in EIG than it will in EMG. And I can give you some examples of where we're going to be putting that investment in. I mentioned in my opening talk that UPT is doing extremely well. This is a high-end measurement company. It did not have substantial exposure to some of the things that we have talked about on the negative side. And they're going to continue to invest. You may recall a while back we did the Creaform acquisition. That company has been just superlative in terms of organic growth. I mean, they're growing at numbers in the 15%, 20% region. These are basically instruments that can very accurately look at an object and convert it to a computer, basically a CAD-type of drawing just by waving the instrument across an object. And very, very good marketplace and we're going to continue to invest in that business. And we're also not afraid to invest in some of the markets that are down. If you look some of our businesses that are in oil and gas, probably more in the mid and down area of oil and gas. We'll probably invest more there. And we'll continue to invest in Power & Industrial and I gave some examples of some of the products in my opening talk. So the focus on engineering investment is going to be higher in EIG. The focus on capital deployment will be higher in EMG because those businesses require more capital to grow. So, that's sort of the view of how we're going to invest. Hope that helps.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: If Okay. Yeah, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please proceed.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Robert.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, I guess a couple of cleanups given the time on a day. I guess, the first question, you may have said this but I was transferring to another call. Were the close of these deals contemporaneous like in January? Or when was the close of these most recent deals?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. They were right after the first of the year. I mean...
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We have been working on them obviously through the fourth quarter. But both closed right after the first of the year.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And I decided to just couple them and get it all out at once in essence.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Right. And obviously, rhetorical question, but clearly that's included in the guidance for the full year of 2016 because they've been closed and they're under reported numbers.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That is correct.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Okay. And then just in terms of the general M&A environment right now, I mean, I guess one thing – obviously the organic environment is very challenging, as you've alluded to, and there's a lot of volatility in kind of not only your businesses but also implicitly in your outlook, as a result. But I guess, thinking about acquisitions in this environment, there could be a real disconnect between bid and ask because sellers' expectations have to get reset further, one would think. And so do you think you could be in a period of a little bit of an air pocket here as kind of seller expectations get kind of reset around kind of their order backlog, their performance? And how do you think about that in what is a dynamic environment?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think you're right that there has to be a reset here. I mean, multiples have been quite high. But as I mentioned to one of the questions, in answer to one of the questions, basically, we're starting to see that now. We're already seeing those multiples come down. Sellers are going to be more realistic. And if you're a seller, you're sitting there and you're saying, either I sell now or I don't want to sell during the downturn. You either sell now or you wait. And that, obviously, depends on the particulars of the given seller. We have examples of – I'm just going back historically now where many family-type businesses just decide at this point that let's do it now instead of waiting. So you do see that dynamic. And it's – right now, we feel pretty good that we're going to be able to close some more deals. We feel very good what we've recently done. But I can't sit here and tell you, it's going to be this or that. And that's the goal, et cetera. It's more that, if we can find some good deals, we're going to execute. That's the bottom line.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Now, Frank, one last question I'll let you go is...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ...basically the following. In this environment, does this make you rethink kind of your time line around transition and management transition, do you want to leave in a volatile environment or would you extend your kind of tenure to just kind of get through the cycle? I mean, how do you think about that in terms of succession?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would not even tie where we are to the transition. That's just not a factor in our thought process, my thought process or the board's thought process. So the transition here is going extremely well. Dave is doing a phenomenal job as a Chief Operating Officer. And the debate here is between the board and my wife.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: As to when I decide. But as I've told you, the transition here will be most likely that I will become Executive Chair, and spend a little bit more time in Florida, and whomever we decide, most likely Dave, obviously, who will take over, they will be dealing obviously with all of the day-to-day issues.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The wife always wins. Thanks.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I don't know. I got a strong board.
Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bhupender Bohra with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Hello?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Hi.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Hi, Bhupender. A little bit louder.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Could you – yeah, we can't hear you.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Can you hear me now?
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yeah. We could hear you. Go ahead.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Frank, can you give us a rundown of sales by region?
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Sorry, Bhupender, you broke up there. We couldn't hear that question.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Can you get closer?
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Can you give us a rundown by region?
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Okay. Geographic rundown?
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Yes.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, sure. I can do that. I'll do the organically. We talked about the total company being down 4%. The U.S. was down 5%. Asia was down 4% and Europe was down 1%.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: And could you talk about China? How much of that was within Asia?
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Say that one more time, Bhupender? We couldn't catch that.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Could you talk about China?
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: China. Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: China, yeah. China was the driver in that minus 4% down in Asia. China was actually down organically, about 15%. So, obviously, that weighed on us. But on the other side, India did incredibly well. They were up well into the double-digits. But China was weak, no question. Everything you hear about China, at least, and the impact on our business is pretty consistent.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Now, I think you can hear me clearly.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Oh, yeah. Now, we can hear you.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. So, I'll make sure you hear this. So the other question on the operating excellence of $120 million for 2016. How should we be thinking about that with the – taking into consideration the midpoint of the guidance? Just give us some color on that $120 million. You said $60 million coming from the global sourcing and procurement? And is that a very conservative number? I mean, usually, the history is like, you guys, actually, kind of up that up as it go through the year. And I just, Frank, if you can?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Right. The $120 million is a number that would reflect the midpoint of our guidance. And I think, it's reasonable to assume that we can improve that number possibly as we go through the year. So there could be definitely some upside that could come from the cost reduction side. No question.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. And lastly, on the M&A, we have been talking about here on the call. Just remind us what's your sweet spot in terms of the size of the deals and what's in the pipeline right now.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean, the deal size, we like to do is up to a couple hundred million dollars in sales. That doesn't preclude us from doing something larger. But we have found if we keep the deal size below that $200 million sales number, we typically can get extremely strong synergy with those deals. And therefore, the return on invested capital is excellent. Also, with those smaller deals, the multiples tend to be lower so that you're not paying quite as much as you will for a larger deal. So I would say that sweet spot is in that sort of $75 million to $200 million area in terms of sales. And when I look at the backlog, we have a fair number of deals that are in our backlog that fit that size range. We also have some deals that are larger, and we also have some deals that are smaller. But that is the sweet spot.
Bhupender Bohra - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen Group. Please proceed.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for running late here to get everybody. Frank, I think I even asked you this last quarter. You talk about Floorcare as being the real economic tale, those kind of products for you guys. And you mentioned I think minus 14% for the quarter. And your outlook for next year looks pretty positive, but the way you said it, it kind of sounded like that's an AMETEK-specific thing and not a market-specific thing with new products and things that you guys have done specifically. So can you maybe talk about that market in context of your broader economic evaluation?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No. I mean, I think the broader market is definitely a factor in this business. And the reason that we're talking that we think it's going to be better next year than it was in the fourth quarter is that, yeah, this is not a major part of AMETEK overall. But fundamentally, we saw some inventory realignments in the fourth quarter with our customers and that's going to bleed through, in a positive sense, as we go into next year. So I would say that the Floorcare business is just consistent with the macro outlook that I've provided. And the people who are running this business have just done a superb job and the profitability has done very, very well. So, this is, actually, not going to be a major issue. At least, that's our feeling right now in 2016.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. And then just two quick clean-up ones for me. On the two deals you announced, I know you said they're contemplated in guidance, did you say how much of an impact you're expecting in 1Q or for the full-year for those? And then last on, I was wondering if there's anything we should be thinking about, any impact from Boeing 747 production cut and how that might apply to you guys?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. On your first question, there is not a substantial impact for the year or in the first quarter. In our guidance, actually, there are some costs that are going through the first quarter, which is included in our guidance, and there's about a $0.005 of costs that are going through the P&L. And as we go through the year, we'll probably recapture that cost downside, but there is not a substantial EPS positive in 2016, we're going to see the impacts will be more in 2017 from an EPS viewpoint. And in terms of some of the announcements around Boeing, if you look at the outlook for Boeing for 2016, their total builds are going to be down about 2%, but offsetting that, Airbus is going to be up about 2%. So if you look at the total commercial build, it's roughly flat. However, if you look at the new aircraft, those are growing at a very, very nice rate, and we have significant content on the new aircraft. And in particular, Airbus. If you look at historically, AMETEK has much more – have had much more content on Boeing aircraft, but with the new aircraft that Airbus is bringing to the market, we now have sizable content on those aircraft. And therefore, our projections are higher than that total bill rates for all aircraft because of the new aircraft in our content list.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for that color.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All righty.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Sorry. Just two quick things. I mean, one is, what kind of – maybe Kevin, what FX impact do you have built into the 2016 revenue guide?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, no impact.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: No impact.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): None?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We're basically saying it's flat.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just last. Frank, could you just talk about last couple of quarters here, we've bought back a fair amount of stock. And I'm just trying to reconcile that with the commentary around the M&A pipeline and maybe expectations. So for deal flow here going forward, do we kind of back off on the stock buyback then in 2016 or...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We know we've done a little bit in the fourth quarter. I would expect we would do some in 2016. But to your point, it's not the primary use of our cash flow.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. The primary use of our cash flow is for M&A. And there's just no strategy change in terms of that. But we may do some stock buybacks in 2016. But that's not our primary focus.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Understood. Thank you again.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All righty, Richard.
Operator: Sir, there are no further questions at this time.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining. And as always I'm available for calls today. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone.

Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a solid third quarter with strong operating performance and earnings growth. We delivered a record level of earnings at the high end of our guidance range despite what remains a challenging and slow growth global environment. Before covering the financial highlights, please note that any references to 2014 financial results will be on an adjusted basis excluding the Zygo integration costs from the third and fourth quarter of 2014. Now on to the results. Sales in the quarter were $998.5 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Organic sales declined 2%, foreign currency was a 4-point headwind and acquisitions added 2%. Operating income for the third quarter increased 3% to $237.6 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.8%, up 130 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2014. Net income increased 3% to a record $156.4 million and diluted earnings per share were up 5% over last year's third quarter to a record $0.65 per diluted share. Turning to our individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a good quarter with solid operating performance. Sales were $598.5 million in the quarter, down 5% from last year's third quarter. The lower sales were driven by a 3% foreign currency headwind. Organic sales declined 2% as a result of the as expected weakness in our upstream Oil & Gas business. EIG's operating income was $162.5 million, up slightly from last year's third quarter. Operating margins were very strong, up 160 basis points to 27.2%. The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with excellent operating performance. Sales were flat for the quarter at $400 million as strong core growth in our Aerospace businesses and the contributions from the acquisition of Global Tubes were offset by foreign currency headwinds and weakness within our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. Organic sales were down 2%. Foreign currency was a 4% headwind and acquisitions added 6%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $86.7 million and operating margins were very strong at 21.7%, up 120 basis points from last year's third quarter. Now, turning to our Four Growth Strategies of: Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion; New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on New Product Development. We continue to see great results from our New Product Development efforts. Our businesses are doing a tremendous job developing new highly-differentiated products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets. We are consistently growing our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are effectively and efficiently developing the right products to serve our customers. One example of this investment is within our Indian R&D Center of Excellence which we developed a number of years ago to help our businesses globalize their R&D efforts and capitalize on the strong engineering talent within India. The success and growth of this effort has been tremendous. We now have over 120 talented engineers in India with more than half of our business units having local R&D talent there. We expect continued expansion of these R&D efforts. Overall, in 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million or about 5% of our sales on RD&E. And some new product introductions, I'll start, our EDAX business unit, a leader in microanalysis and micro-XRF systems has added its state of the art EDS system offering with the introduction of the next generation Octane Elite Series. The next-gen Octane Elite offers new to the world differentiated features that benefit our customers, including thermal, corrosion, and shock resistance, increased sensitivity to X-rays, and high speed X-ray data processing capabilities in a much smaller footprint. Our Programmable Power business, the global leader in programmable AC and DC power test solutions, expanded its line of stand-alone photovoltaic simulators with their newest product, the Embedded TerraSAS. The TerraSAS was specifically developed to test solar energy microgrids by mimicking the behavior of ground-based solar energy arrays. The new simulator allows for a 50% increase in output power over our existing offering and now spans a range from 5 kilowatts to 15 kilowatts of power and you can put multiple simulators together paralleled up to support solar array installations up to 500 kilowatts of power. So very high power capability. And lastly, our Reichert technology business, a pioneer and leader in the development of vision diagnostic devices, launched its most advanced Ocular Response Analyzer, the G3, during the quarter. The new analyzer is the only tonometer capable of measuring cornea hysteresis which is a strong predictor of glaucoma progression and also provides a better indication of true eye pressure than other methods of tonometry. The analyzer was designed to provide a more streamlined product and better user experience. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was very strong at 24% of sales in the quarter, up from 23% in last year's third quarter. Now turning to Global & Market Expansion, we will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channel, service infrastructure and manufacturing footprint in emerging markets to capitalize on the attractive long-term growth opportunities. In the third quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We saw very strong growth in our Aerospace businesses in both Europe and Asia during the quarter. Combined, our Aerospace businesses grew double-digits organically in international markets as a result of strong shipments to support the production ramp-up of the A320neo and A350 commercial aircraft as well as the Joint Strike Fighter military aircraft. Now, turning to acquisitions. We continue to see great success with our acquisition strategy. Thus far in 2015, we've completed two deals deploying approximately $360 million in capital. And we acquired nearly $180 million in revenue. Over the last 24 months, we've completed nine acquisitions, deployed approximately $1.2 billion in capital, and acquired approximately $600 million in revenue. Our most recent acquisition, Surface Vision, was completed in the third quarter. Surface Vision develops and manufactures software-enabled vision systems to inspect the surfaces of continuously-processed materials for flaws and defects. The business' proprietary high-speed defect-recognition technology detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. The business is an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK as it expands our presence in the non-destructive process inspection market. And in addition, Surface Vision will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within its Visions systems. Surface Vision is headquartered in Hayward, California, and has annual sales of approximately $60 million. And the integration of this particular deal is going well and we're very excited to have the Surface Vision team now as part of AMETEK. Our business unit and M&A teams continue to manage a very active pipeline of attractive opportunities and acquisitions will continue to be a focus for AMETEK and the primary use of our strong cash flow. I'll touch on our last strategy, Operational Excellence. Our team continues to deliver excellent operating performance through the use of our various Operational Excellence tools. In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall in 2015, we now anticipate approximately $150 million of Operational Excellence savings, with the largest contributor to this savings, being our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, which we expect approximately $75 million in savings in 2015. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015. As noted, the global environment remains challenging. We're seeing sluggish conditions across many of our markets and geographies. And we expect the sluggishness to continue for the remainder of the year. Therefore, for all of 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be approximately $2.55, up 5% over 2014. Fourth quarter 2015 sales are expected to be down low single digits on a percentage basis from last year's fourth quarter, with organic growth down low single digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.63 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. So in summary, I'm pleased with our results this quarter given the difficult market conditions. We delivered excellent operating performance and record earnings while continuing to make long term investments across each of our growth strategies. I'd like to take this time to acknowledge the great work by all AMETEK employees in helping drive these strong results and for their commitment to driving each of AMETEK's growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Bob will now cover some of the financial details and then we'll be glad to take your questions.
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid third quarter with good operating results. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were down more than total sales on a percentage basis, due to good cost containment. General and administrative expenses were 1.1% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's third quarter level of 1.2% of sales. Other expense in the quarter was lower in comparison to last year's third quarter as a result of higher expense due to a one-time insurance write-off in last year's third quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%, up from 25.1% in last year's quarter. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 27.5% as a result of our ongoing international and state tax planning. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.2% of sales in the third quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $19 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $38 million for the quarter and 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. Operating cash flow was $188 million in the third quarter. And free cash flow was $168 million, or 108% of net income in the quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 110% of net income. The primary use of our strong cash flow is to support our acquisition strategy. In the third quarter, we deployed approximately $160 million for the acquisition of Surface Vision. Year-to-date, we've deployed approximately $360 million on acquisitions. And over the last 24 months, we have deployed $1.2 billion in capital. In addition, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of stock for approximately $250 million. Total debt was $1.92 billion at September 30, up $200 million from the 2014 year-end. This amount reflects the third funding from the Private Placement Agreement we entered into last September. This funding was $150 million, was received on August 14 and was used to pay down term debt which matured in the quarter. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $328 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 32.4%. At September 30, we had approximately $950 million of cash in existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. In summary, we had a strong third quarter. We are well positioned for future growth with a strong balance sheet and cash flow.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. Thank you, Bob. Operator, we'll now open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you very much. And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Allison.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Could you talk, Frank, a little bit about the deceleration, what was different from even last quarter that drove this Q4 a little bit weaker than you maybe anticipated?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure, Allison. In essence, when you look across the company, EIG performed in line with our expectations. We saw in EMG that the combination of Aerospace which was very strong was offset to a larger degree than we had anticipated in our Engineered Materials Interconnects & Packaging business. And the net of that ended up with in the third quarter a minus 2% organic growth for EMG. And we believe that that is going to continue in the fourth quarter. So we are seeing the result of the, I'll call it, industrial recession that's being talked about substantially now. And we decided as a result that the fourth quarter, which also was very strong from the viewpoint of expectation, needed to be lowered a bit.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Great. And then just obviously acquisitions, you've been very active over the last 24 months. Can you give us somewhat of an update, how they're progressing? Obviously, the macro environment is certainly a large headwind here, but in terms of your expectations going into them, both on a revenue and maybe a profit side as well?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean, we're pretty bullish on the acquisition environment. We're working on a number of deals. Without giving specifics, I can tell you that in the third quarter, we worked on a very large deal actually. It would have been the largest deal that AMETEK has ever done. But unfortunately or I guess fortunately, depending on how you look at it, we did find a contingent liability in that deal that caused us to basically not continue with that deal. Putting that aside, we are in due diligence right now on other deals. We feel good about it. As we mentioned, it's the primary use of our cash flow. It's difficult to predict when deals will close. But you're going to be hearing from us either this quarter or surely in the first quarter of next year with additional deals.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Matt.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Just a quick clarification. There was no M&A contribution in EIG. And I thought the Surface Vision deal closed within the first few weeks of the quarter. So, could you clarify when that will be hitting your results?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No. Actually, what occurred there is that Surface Vision was in the quarter. If you go back a year to when we did the Zygo acquisition in the third quarter of 2014, we actually had a stub period for that business because we acquired it right at the end of Q2 of last year. So that when you do the comparison between acquisitions this year in Q3 versus last year, you get an abnormality. In reality, in the quarter, we saw approximately $15 million of sales from Surface Vision, which was countered by basically that stub period. So, that's a good pickup, Matt.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you. Okay, great. That helps. So, just to kind of follow up on the end market question. Did you say Oil & Gas was kind of expected through the quarter? And it seems like just based on the magnitude of the deceleration, maybe it was more than just EMIP. So, anything besides that in the Process side that's coming in weaker than expected or just this industrial malaise is touching most of your businesses, it seems? Any change in Oil & Gas specifically?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. We had given an estimate in Oil & Gas back in the first quarter. We said that our total exposure was around $400 million. And we expected about a 10% reduction in that due to the upstream portion which was around $40 million and, in fact, that's what we're seeing. We called it right. Our people did a really good job of estimating what the impact would be. And therefore, on the EIG side, we have not changed our outlook based on Oil & Gas, and it really performed, as I said in my opening remarks, in line with expectation. The difference was there's obviously a global macro condition here that is having impact on a number of businesses, but when you really isolate the change in EMG, it did come down to our Aerospace businesses, which did very well, being offset by weakness in our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business. And when we look at that Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business, it is really a global macro that is driving that. It's not a specific item, et cetera. It's just the global macro condition. So, that is the area of the company that we've seen an impact due to the industrial recession, for lack of a better set of words. Does that help?
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes, it does. Thanks very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right, Matt.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Joe.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Frank, coming into the year, I think you were expecting or at least you guided to about 30 basis points to 40 basis points of margin improvement, which was consistent with what you've seen in the last few years. You're trending, I think, basically 100 basis points up year-over-year through three quarters. It sounds like that's going to continue into the fourth quarter. So, I guess my question is, obviously, you guys know what you're doing in terms of cost management, but as we look at this sort of slow growth going forward, can you continue to get margin expansion, or does the shift focus to more just sustaining where you're at in this industrial recession type environment?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Great question, Joe. No, we're pretty bullish on margins. And you're absolutely right that we started the year with a lower number. But you may recall in the first quarter, we took some specific actions when we realized that the year was going to be weak, as most industrial companies were seeing. So, as a result, our guidance has been in the 100-basis-point arena, and that's what we're expecting for the entire year, that we're going to be up about 100 basis points. As we go into next year, which, really, was the key part of your question, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business. And one advantage of our MIP (26:30) strategy is that there are a lot of actions that we can take to basically improve the operating performance by putting various manufacturing facilities together, being more aggressive in the materials side of the business which, as you know, we've put tremendous infrastructure in place that we can continue to drive good earnings growth there. We've got value analysis and value engineering which is picking up steam in the company. So, we are in the process right now of putting our budgets together for next year. I'm not prepared to give you an exact number. We will do that in the January or, I guess, maybe early February call, whenever we're going to have it in the beginning of the year, and we'll give you guidance. But I can tell you, margins will be up. No questions asked.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, can you give us a rundown by region, kind of what you saw by region?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure. If you look at our performance in the main geographic areas, the U.S. was flat. This is all organic. Asia was down 7% and Europe was down about 1%. So Asia, if you look at the change when you go back in time, we were growing our Asia business in the double-digit positive arena. And now, we're seeing obviously the effects of what's going on, principally in China. And the organic growth in China in Q3 was actually a negative 12%, and that compared with last year's third quarter when we were up 17%. So, very significant change in China. And then, just sort of a slower growth in the other parts of the world, Europe is hanging in there. Probably a little bit better than we had expected.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right, Joe.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Yes. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Andrew.
Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Just a question on growth. With the latest guidance, EPS growth is now likely to come in at sort of mid-single digits, and this is – even if we exclude 2009, this is the lowest level in a decade. And from your perspective, what can get EPS growth to reaccelerate in the near-term?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. First of all, I mean, if you go back – you said a decade. If you go back to 2008 and 2009, when we were in the recession, we surely had – our earnings growth was negative. The key part of how we're going to get the numbers up is it's basically going to come down doing more deals, using that strong cash flow to acquire companies. And, obviously, we look at that on a return-on-invested-capital viewpoint, but that will also drive EPS growth. And then, we've been very careful as we've made the cost reductions in the company to focus on the operations side of the business, not on our engineering and sales and distribution side of the business. And that's – you heard me in my opening remarks talk substantially to that. So, we're going to continue. And with those engineering efforts, we're hoping that we'll be able to offset some of the effects of the global macro. So, the basic answer to your question is to get better organic growth and do deals. That's the key. And we'll continue, as we always have. It's sort of the hallmark of AMETEK to continue to do cost improvements across the business. So, those are the drivers, and that's why, as I mentioned to Joe's question, that I think we're going to see margin improvement. And you're not seeing many industrial companies right now showing double-digit EPS growth.
Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: No. And are you guys seeing – just a follow-up question. So, A, if I understood you correctly, so high R&D and investment, just ability to take share in the stuff environment. Is that what I've heard?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Right. That's what you heard.
Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: And just a follow-up question, are you guys seeing any headwinds or changes in demand in aerospace, and particularly in bizjets?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. We have a very good story in bizjets. And it is not because of the market. The market is kind of bouncing along bottom. Maybe you're hearing a little bit of uptick in the market, but we've been very successful in putting new content on a number of the new airplanes. We're on the HondaJet for example. We do a lot in helicopters which we put in this business jet arena. And actually, orders for our business jets in the third quarter were up 30%.
Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Wow.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, But again, it's not because of the market. The commercial side of the business, it's a different story where there we are seeing a market, I guess, tailwind to use a pun, where those market conditions are definitely better than business and regional jet. And at some point, we think the business in regional jet market will turn; it always does. People have been predicting that upturn for a number of years and it hasn't happened. So, we decided just to get very aggressive in terms of new products on the newer aircraft. And our team has done a great job and that's why we're growing so well.
Andrew Burris Obin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Andrew.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors: Hey, Frank. A couple questions. First, just to put this into context, can you talk about, first, what your organic order number looked like in the quarter and what the organic book-to-bill would have been? And then talk about the linearity you experienced. I guess, I'm trying to all put this into context. I've obviously been familiar with AMETEK for a while now. Typically, the fourth quarter is your best EPS quarter of the year. Are you really just trying to derisk that going to $0.63? It's been quite a while since you've had a Q4 less than what you've earned really throughout the prior part of the year. I'm just trying to put all of this together.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Matt. Well, you asked a number of questions there. Let me see if I can answer each of those. Yes, I'll say we definitely derisked the fourth quarter. We just felt with the global macro that we're seeing and the changes that I've already talked about that we just decided to essentially derisk it. And we're going to obviously concentrate in Q4 on getting good results for the following year. So, as you say, you've known us for many, many years and we definitely did derisk it. The order numbers, overall orders were down about 2% in the quarter. Organically, they were actually down 5%, but that number is not a fair representation of the business. And the reason is that last year in that quarter, we had some very large one-off orders. So, I think if you normalize that out, the organic growth was in line with, or lack thereof, was in line with the sales growth. So, I think you put that whole picture together, you see a slowing macro. We just decided that we were going to derisk Q4.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors: And then just to revisit the China question. I think you said you were up 17% last year, down 12% this year. While I get the comp could give you those (35:26) that's actually a pretty surprising number to me. Can you talk about from an end-market standpoint more of what you're seeing there? And I realize it's not a gigantic part of your sales, just more of trying to get a bigger picture of what's going on there. That's a big decline.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. You were breaking up there. I think I got your question. So actually, this is not a change. Last quarter, I don't remember the exact number, but it was in that – it was negative 5%, one of the guys is telling me. So, there really hasn't been a major change in our outlook there. I mean, basically, you're looking at a situation in China that is a basic change. You look at the PMI in China. I was just reading a report actually last night. The latest PMI came out at 47% for China when it was running at close to 60%. So, there just has been a change in the industrial environment in China. So, I don't think it's a major change sort of sequentially in Asia, but clearly it is a major driver in our organic growth. The other thing, I said minus 7% and minus 5%, those numbers were for all of Asia, okay? The minus 12% in China was offset by strong performance in Japan actually last quarter and this quarter. And also, some of the other parts of Asia are doing much better. But the drag is definitely China.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors: Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet, Matt.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Frank, you had mentioned the EIG business with core growth was down about 2%. You had suggested that that was at plan. Is that...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, that – not our original plan but at our forecast. If you look – let's just take EIG and segment this, so you have a flavor as to what is actually going on here. Our Aerospace businesses in EIG were very good. They were up mid-single digits in the quarter on sales and orders, actually. So that part of EIG performed as we had anticipated. You look at the Power & Industrial piece of EIG, that was up low-single digits which was our expectation. The drag was in Process where that was down low-single digits and because Process is a larger part of EIG, that drove that negative 2% overall organic growth. And yes, that's basically what we said last quarter when we provided the outlook. We said that the organic growth for EIG for the entire year was going to be basically flat, and that's what we're predicting now. So there hasn't been what I would call a major change in EIG. It's been pretty much as we anticipated. And the issue is very simple there, it's Oil & Gas. That's what's driving it and it's the upstream piece.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then so...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Does that help?
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. And so fourth quarter then, core growth could be flattish or so?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We're saying low single digits negative.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): For EIG as well. Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then can I also – I guess – maybe I just – I don't understand the comment that you made about Zygo stub period impacting the revenue contribution from SISD. I mean, if you closed SISD in early July, the acquisition contribution in revenue should be reflected there. I don't understand the Zygo offset comment. I mean, was there – was it just – was there a deferred revenue issue with SISD?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, no, no.
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, no.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Oh, no. Bob, why don't you explain?
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, the issue was that we closed Zygo at the very end of the second quarter of last year. And therefore, some of the sales were reflected in the third quarter of 2014. So, the first period of reporting for Zygo really was the third quarter of last year. And it had the last, say, 10 days or so of the second quarter sales after acquisition that showed up in the third quarter.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, when you do the comparison, Rick, what basically happens is we got, as you indicated, $12 million to $15 million of revenue from Surface Vision. But what we're talking about is when you compare it to Q3 of last year, we had the same amount from that stub period, so you end up with, quarter over quarter, no acquisition growth. But if you just look at it on an absolute basis, you're absolutely right that we saw the roughly $15 million of volume from Surface Vision in Q3 of this year. Does that all make sense now?
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): No, it doesn't.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No?
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I'll follow up with Kevin, but I -
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, why don't you follow up with Kevin.
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): If there's revenue coming in, there's revenue coming in. And then the other question that I had was just, Frank, in the past week, we've looked at the EMIP business as somewhat of a leading indicator for global macro and for your overall businesses. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, EMIP has some exposure to the Aerospace markets as well. So, how do you reconcile the drastic slowdown in EMIP with your forecast going forward?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think – first, let me comment on what's the early indicator. The early indicator is actually our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business. We have always used that as an indicator of the global macro. And in fact, that did slow as well. But EMIP, because it's a larger part of the organization, it had a more significant impact. And, yes, there is some Aerospace in there, which actually did quite well, but it's a small part of that overall operation. So that when you see the reduction and put that across the entire EMG, basically all of Aerospace, not just in EMIP, but all of Aerospace in that differentiated part of EMG was basically more than compensated for by the shortfall in EMIP. And, therefore, the total organic growth was down this 1% or 2%. So yeah, okay?
Rick C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Frank, got a question about how things trended from earlier in the quarter through September and into October. And, I guess, there's a quantitative aspect to the question. But on a qualitative side, do you feel like the reset on the macro is in or is that a question for another day?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Say that again? Is the...
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Just wondering how things tailed up during the quarter if you compare the early part of the quarter to September and into October. And do you feel like the reset in the macro is in place or is that a question for another day?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Yeah. No. No. I feel it's in place and, actually, if you'll look at the order trend in the quarter, it was actually up from the beginning of Q3 to the end of Q3. But the absolute levels were lower than we had anticipated. And, yes, I think we have taken the global macro now into account and we dealt with through the costs and we're looking at now what next year is going to look like. I'm not looking at further deterioration. I don't feel that. But I do feel like, as I said before, the target for the fourth quarter was a very high one. And you look at numbers that were up in the $0.68, $0.69 region. And with this global macro, you couldn't make that ramp. It's just too big a ramp.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. So, you don't see any further unraveling in the macro?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): You feel like there's a good read on the macro from where you sit right now?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I feel there's a good read on the macro now. Yes. Absolutely.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Nigel.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, Frank, no more questions on Zygo. I think I get it.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. We're good.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just I thought your 4Q comments were interesting in terms of you derisked the 4Q guidance. So, just want to clarify that. So, based on prior years, there should be, what, $0.02 or $0.03 of contingency based on your plan?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: There's contingency. There's definitely contingency. So, I'm not going to speak to the amount. But if things go well, we'll beat that number.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And clearly, Oil & Gas took a toll on the Process performance. You've said in the past, upstream very weak but midstream, downstream – I wouldn't say good but holding the line. What is your current commentary on midstream and downstream and how do you think that looks in 2016 (46:04)?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Great question, Nigel. There has been no change. What we said at the beginning of the year is the upstream piece was going to be down about 25%, and the mid and downstream piece would be down slightly, low-single digits. And that's in fact what we're seeing. The mid and downstream is holding in there and we have not seen a deceleration in that piece of the business. I know there was some concern a quarter or two ago, of whether we were going to see that. And in fact, we have not seen it. So the impact on us is largely the upstream part of the business and it's down about what we had expected.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just finally, Frank, pricing has been pretty strong year-to-date. Have you seen any deterioration in pricing given the weakening macro?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Just a little bit. We have been talking numbers on pricing, I think the first few quarters of the year at about 1.5%. And when we rolled up Q3, it came in about 1.3%. But that's sort of a normal variation. So, I don't think there's been a deceleration. But it's not the 2% that we were seeing a number of years ago. And very few industrial companies are seeing a 2% number. So, we're actually fairly happy with staying around that 1.5% level.
Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Nigel.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah. Hi. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I know Nigel might get it, I'm actually still pretty confused about the M&A, but I'll take it offline. It almost seems to me like maybe organic is being overstated the way it's being discussed, but...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Oh, no, not at all. Not at all, yeah. I think this stuff here is what confuses you. If you're just looking at absolute numbers, there was $15 million of acquisition growth. If you look at it that way. It's only when you compare it to the third quarter of last year does it cause the confusion, and that's the way we typically talk about acquisition growth is on a comparison basis. So, it really just depends how you look at it. There's nothing strange going on here. It's just the way you look at it.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. I'll follow up with Kevin after. Just separately, most of my questions have been answered. But maybe just talk to free cash flow conversation. So, you took it down a little bit and I think you were previously 115%, now you're 110%, CapEx has taken down a little bit. Maybe just talk about the puts and takes there. Is it maybe a little bit on working capital that you're not getting out is what you thought, or are there items?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Right. You hit it, Brian. When you see a slowing macro, we did have some working capital buildup. It was not substantial, but it did go up and that was a driver. And we're giving you rough estimates here. I think the 110% is actually conservative. It's going to be better than that. But we did want to be fair in saying that it probably is not going to reach the 115% level.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Okay. And do you think the $70 million is – oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Apologize.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. I didn't say anything.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: I thought...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think there's some background.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: There's some feedback. Yeah. Just the CapEx at $70 million, so you're confident that it will still be spent, it still assumes do some pickup in the fourth quarter? Flat with last year but obviously you've been trending below?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No. It's definitely possible we'll spend less than that. We dropped it from $75 million to $70 million, and it would not surprise me if we ended up at a $65 million number there.
Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC: Yeah. All right. Great. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey. You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Joe.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, you mentioned, Frank, that the Engineering Materials and Packaging are the biggest variants from when you last gave guidance. And I was just wondering if there was anything specific on the cost side incremental to what you had already planned or what you typically do as part of your continuous improvement that you've identified over that period that you're going to put through?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No. That's a great question, Joe. What we decided and I think I mentioned this on my last call was that the total cost improvements through the whole company that we talked about last quarter was $145 million. And what we have done is increase that to, I would call it, a conservative number which is $150 million. So definitely, we are active on the cost side of the business and we put additional measures in place, not all in EMIP but obviously that would be a place where some of this would occur. And so yes, the answer to your question is we have taken additional cost actions in the business.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's (51:33)
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And that's why – if I could just add a comment. That's why when we were asked question about Q3 and derisking it, we really did derisk it given that fact as well.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: So that's a realized $150 million for 2015?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: For all – yes. For all of 2015. A realized number.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then you seem to tee up a question that didn't get asked. You said that the best read was Floorcare & Specialty Motor but, so what's going on there, what are you seeing?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Basically, organic growth down low single digits.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Down low. Okay. And then just last for me, you mentioned the Joint Strike Fighter ramp. Just curious as to any commentary overall on military across the segments.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Military has been a phenomenally good story for us. When you look across the whole company and look at the military part of the business, basically it was up mid single digits. And, yeah, exactly. Some of that is obviously driven by the Joint Strike Fighter but there's also great international military business that we are capitalizing on. So that when you look at the Aerospace segment has been a very positive story for us and a surprise, I would say, in the other direction. For the full year, we're saying we expect military to be up low single digits because some of the first quarters weren't as strong as this third quarter in military. But it's doing well. It's just doing well. And I guess Congress has come to a budget agreement which could further help this. So we'll see what happens.
Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for the color.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Oh, sure.
Operator: And, gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time.

Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a strong second quarter with excellent operating performance. We delivered a record level of earnings at the high end of our guidance range despite what remains a slow global growth environment. We also continued to be very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes, a leading manufacturer of high precision, small diameter metal tubing, and subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed the acquisition of the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation. I will provide some further details on our continued strong acquisition activity in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 1% to $1 billion. Organic sales were flat while acquisitions added 5% and currency was a 4% headwind. Operating income for the quarter was very strong. It increased 4% to a record $240.3 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was excellent at 23.9%, a 50-basis-point improvement over the second quarter of 2014. Net income rose 4% to $155.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.64, up 5% over last year's second quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was up 5% to $163 million. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very strong quarter. Sales were up 4% to $596.5 million on strength in our Aerospace business plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Zygo and Amptek in our Process business. Organic sales were up 1%, acquisitions added 7% and foreign currency was a 4% headwind. EIG's operating performance was outstanding. Operating income increased 8% to $164 million and operating margins were 27.5%, up 110 basis points from last year's second quarter. The Electromechanical Group also had a good quarter with strong operating performance. Overall sales were down 2% to $407.3 million. The lower sales were driven largely by currency headwinds with the contribution from the acquisition of Global Tubes, a partial offset. Organic sales were down 2% driven by continued weak global macro conditions, foreign currency was a five-point headwind and acquisitions contributed four points. EMG's operating income declined 3% to $89.3 million while operating margins were very solid at 21.9%. Now turning to our four global strategies of: Operational Excellence; Global & Market Expansion; New Product Development; and Strategic Acquisitions. First I will touch on Acquisitions. We continue to remain very active, acquiring two excellent businesses since our last earnings call. Thus far in 2015, we have deployed approximately $360 million in capital and acquired approximately $180 million in revenue on these two acquisitions. Over the last 24 months, we've acquired 10 businesses, deployed over $1.3 billion in capital and acquired nearly $650 million in revenue. Our acquisition pipeline remains very strong. Now let me provide some highlights on the two recent acquisitions. First, Global Tubes; Global Tubes manufactures high precision, small diameter metal tubing from stainless steel, nickel alloys, zirconium alloys and titanium for very specialized applications. These highly specialized products are manufactured of very tight tolerances and customer specifications for demanding applications within the aerospace, medical, nuclear, and oil and gas markets. Global Tubes is a really good strategic fit with our Specialty Metals business. It allows us to expand our product offering into a number of attractive market segments, while also expanding our Specialty Metals presence within Europe. Global Tubes is comprised of two businesses: Superior Tube, based in Collegeville, Pennsylvania and Fine Tubes based in the UK. Global Tubes has annual sales of approximately $120 million. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation. The Surface Inspection Systems Division or SISD develops and manufactures software-enabled vision systems used to inspect surfaces of continuously processed materials for flaws and defects. SISD's proprietary high-speed defect recognition technology detects, classifies and accurately maps specific defects over the entire area of the surface. This business is also an excellent strategic acquisition for AMETEK as it expands our presence in the non-destructive process inspection market. In addition, SISD will be able to leverage a number of AMETEK's complementary technologies and products within its vision systems. SISD is headquartered in Hayward, California, and has annual sales of about $60 million. Now turning to Global & Market Expansion; Global & Market Expansion continues to be an important driver for our growth through the expansion of our presence in attractive, higher growth market segments and geographic regions. In the second quarter of 2015, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. We continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities, and manufacturing footprint, in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities. For example, we continue to make sizable investments in both India and Serbia to drive our Global & Market Expansion initiatives. In India, our business continues to add sales and service capabilities to support increased demand for our products and technology. Additionally, we've been very pleased with the tremendous success of our Engineering Center of Excellence in India. As a result, we continue to expand and then broaden our RD&E capabilities and infrastructure in that region. In Serbia, we have a low-cost manufacturing facility which was acquired as part of the Dunkermotoren acquisition in 2012. This facility primarily serves our Precision Motion Control customers in Europe and the Middle East. As other AMETEK businesses identify incremental growth opportunities in Europe and especially the Middle East, we are expanding our presence within Serbia to adequately support their growth. Now turning to New Product Development, we continue to see excellent results from our New Product Development efforts. Our businesses are doing a great job developing new products to serve both their existing markets and to help penetrate adjacent markets or applications. We'll continue to make sizable investments in RD&E to ensure we are developing the right products to serve our customers in target markets. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $210 million on RD&E, or approximately 5% of sales. We've made a number of recent new product introductions. SPECTRO Analytical Instruments, a global leader in instruments for advanced elemental analysis, introduced their new portable SPECTROSCOUT X-ray fluorescence spectrometer designed for at-line use. This durable and compact XRF analyzer delivers reliable, precise and fast laboratory-quality elemental composition monitoring and quality control testing for the field or manufacturing floor. The new SPECTROSCOUT delivers results onsite, eliminating the need to transport samples back to a quality-control laboratory. Zygo, a leader in optical metrology solutions, high-precision optics and optical assemblies, released its Verifire XL high-precision large aperture Fizeau interferometer. It is the latest addition to Zygo's industry-leading line of phase-shifting laser interferometers, and is designed to measure large plano surfaces such as mirrors, semiconductor wafers, and wafer chucks. The product is a compact, cost-effective and complete turnkey solution with a highly-accurate characterization of flat surfaces up to 12 inches in diameter. To further increase precision and reliability, this new Zygo product incorporates a vibration isolation platform from another AMETEK business, our TMC business. Lastly, Solidstate Controls, a recognized leader in highly-customized uninterruptible power supplies, has released its DSE UPS system. This new DSE system is an industry first; it combines the robust design of a ferroresonant transformer with the enhanced digital communications, monitoring, and diagnostic capabilities of a pulse width modulation UPS system. It is a true, on-line, double-conversion UPS system that provides highly reliable, clean, and regulated power for critical AC loads in demanding process control applications. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 24% of sales in the second quarter, up from 22% in last year's second quarter; it's a very high number, which we're very proud of. Lastly, I will touch on Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. We continue to see tremendous results from our various Operational Excellence initiatives. Our teams continue to do an excellent job driving operational improvements in their business by leveraging the numerous Operational Excellence tools we have in place throughout the company. In low-growth environments, the success of our Operational Excellence initiatives takes on even greater importance, so we are able to continue to drive meaningful margin expansion, while allowing us to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. Overall, in 2015, we anticipate approximately $145 million of total Operational Excellence savings, and we believe that's a conservative number. The largest contributor to this savings is our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, where we expect approximately $70 million in savings in 2015. Turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2015, we anticipate 2015 revenue to be up low single-digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Organic growth is expected to be roughly flat for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We continue to expect adjusted earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over last year's adjusted earnings per share. Third quarter 2015 sales are expected to be approximately flat versus the third quarter of 2014. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.64 to $0.65 per diluted share in the third quarter, up 3% to 5% over last year's third quarter. So in summary, we delivered strong results in the second quarter with record earnings. While global growth remains challenging, we are very confident in our ability to execute on our growth strategies and to deliver excellent earnings growth. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions.
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a good second quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, selling expenses were down slightly versus last year's second quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales, slightly above last year's second quarter level of 1.2%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.7%, down slightly from last year's second quarter rate of 28%. For 2015, we expect our tax rate to be between 28% and 28.5%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 19.1% of sales in the second quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $12 million for the quarter. Full year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $37 million for the quarter and 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. Operating cash flow was $163 million in the second quarter, up 5% over last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was $152 million in the quarter, up 8% over last year's second quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow, excluding the $50 million pension contribution made in the first quarter, to be approximately 115% of net income. Total debt was $1.67 billion at June 30, down slightly from the 2014 yearend. This amount reflects the second funding from the private placement agreement we entered into last September. This funding of $50 million was received on June 15 and was used to pay down revolver debt. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $327 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at June 30 of 27.9%. At June 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. During the second quarter, we acquired Global Tubes. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired the Surface Inspection Systems Division of Cognex Corporation, bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2015 to approximately $360 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had a very strong second quarter, and delivered solid operating results. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you, Bob. Tara, we'll now open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. I just wanted to just ask if you could do your thing with each of the business units and what have you? And maybe before that just tell us what pricing was in the quarter for the company?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Pricing was up 1.5%, and I can add that the total inflation across the company was such that the net of pricing minus inflation was 0.6%.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So, sure, Scott, I'd be glad to go through my normal discussion of the various subparts of the two groups. And I'll start with EIG. EIG Aerospace had a very solid second quarter. Overall growth was up low single digits against a very difficult comparison. We saw strong growth in our regional and business jet business and continued solid growth in our commercial business. EIG Aerospace continues to gain additional content on a number of attractive platforms, really as a result of their strong technology and service capabilities. Very importantly, thus far in 2015, we have won over $400 million in new lifer program awards (21:25) on over 20 different platforms, including the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engine on the Airbus 330neo. Our team in this business has really done an excellent job. For all of 2015, we expect EIG Aerospace sales to be up mid-single digits, driven by the continued ramp up of key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. The second part of EIG is our Process businesses. Overall Process sales were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Overall growth benefited from the acquisitions that we did in Process, they were Zygo and Amptek, and from solid growth in our Material Analysis and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses. Organic sales were flat as a result of weakness in our Upstream Oil & Gas business. The weakness that we've seen in Oil & Gas is in line with our original expectations at the start of the year. In 2015, we expect organic sales growth to be down slightly versus 2014. And the last part of EIG is Power and Industrial. Our Power and Industrial businesses had a very good second quarter. Organic sales were up mid-single digits with solid growth across both our Power and Industrial businesses. And in 2015 for the whole year, we expect our organic sales for Power and Industrial to be up low-single digits. So, if you take the sum of those three, for all of EIG, we're expecting organic sales to be approximately flat for 2014 (sic) [2015] (23:19). Moving to EMG, starting with the differentiated part of EMG, overall sales were down low-single digits on a percentage basis in the quarter as foreign currency headwinds were only partially offset by the contribution from the Global Tubes acquisition. Organically, we saw a solid growth in our Precision Motion Control business, but weakness in our Engineered Materials Interconnect & Packaging business due to the continued soft macro environment. For 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be approximately flat organically. And the last part of the company, our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business, organic sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors business were flat in the second quarter, and for 2015, we expect sales for this business to be up low-single digits organically. So in 2015, for all of EMG, thus we expect roughly flat organic sales growth on a percentage basis. So, sort of the bottom line here is with organic growth very difficult for just about every industrial company, the focus really becomes cost. And we've done an excellent job, as typical of AMETEK, in terms of reducing our cost structure and obviously getting record earnings and record performance as a result. So, Scott, that's sort of a recap of what you asked for.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: That's perfect, Frank. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Allison.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: How are you? Just following on the prior comments, Energy sounds like it's coming in line with what you're looking at. I guess I don't know have the notes from last quarter, but what's become progressively weaker that you're now expecting a sort of lower organic for this year?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. There's no question just the general industrial environment is softer than we had expected. Europe is obviously having difficulties and in Asia as well, the growth, while still overall we're relatively bullish on Asia, there's no question that the overall growth is slower. So, it's not specific in any given business, Allison, it's just a general sort of slow macro. And getting back to my point that I mentioned with Scott, we have been very aggressive on the cost side of the business and, as I stated, the $145 million of cost reductions is actually a conservative number, and therefore we've got really good confidence in our earnings, given the global macro.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's great. And then just touching on the operating side, I imagine there's some acquisition-related accounting and cost in that number. Do you have a sense of what the – I mean I imagine the organic expansion of those businesses were much higher. Can you touch on that a little bit?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. You're talking about the costs that go through the P&L as a result of buying these businesses. It's probably on the order of a $0.01.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Oh, okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That's the magnitude of it. So, you couple those costs with the currency impacts, which although not off the charts, we lost another couple of pennies in terms of earnings in the quarter as a result of this. So, that's why these cost reductions become so critical; you're just fighting a number of headwinds.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks so much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet, Allison.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Mark.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Payables were?
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: $384 million.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: $384 million. Great, thank you.
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: You're welcome.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Frank, you mentioned Europe and then Asia were a little disappointing. You grew mid-teens in China in first quarter, so I think it was a real surprise to everybody; that was a very good number. I assume you've seen the slowdown in China catch up to you, and then can you size what China is now? And what the slowdown is like there?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean if I give you a geographic look at our business, Europe was down about 4% organically and obviously, that's just a result of the general economic condition in Europe. In Asia, we were actually down 6%, but that was against a very tough comparison. Organically last year, in the second quarter, Asia actually had 15% organic growth, so it was a very difficult comparison, so we don't expect that it's going to be down that much as we go forward, but again, it's not going to be as robust as it was a number of quarters ago. And actually, the best performance was in the U.S., which was up about 5% organically. And when you sum those, based on our heavy concentration outside the U.S., that's how you get to the relatively flat organic growth overall.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: U.S. is up 5%, is that related to your Power and Industrial also being up mid-single digits? That was...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, the Power and Industrial segment was good; the Aerospace business in particular was very good in the U.S. So, they were key drivers to our performance and also, our Precision Motion Control business on the EMG side of the business had very strong U.S. performance. So I think, if you just step back from those parts of the world, it's kind of reflective of what's happening in the global environment in each of those businesses. The U.S. is getting better, albeit slowly, but it is getting better. Europe is tough, and Asia is slowing. And that's sort of the global picture.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Just finally on the power and industrial, can you go into a little bit of detail, what businesses within there, or what markets, were particularly good for you?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, well, the good thing there is, both power and industrial were very, very good. In the industrial side, although a small part of overall AMETEK, the heavy vehicle business continues to do very well, and it triggered very good growth in the industrial piece. If you look at North American heavy truck sales, it's estimated this year to be about 325,000 trucks, which is up about 10% over last year. So we are enjoying that. If we look at our power business and you break it down, there's really three parts to the power business. There's a test and measurement piece of the power business; there's a battery backup piece of the power business; and then there's instrumentation for the generation, transmission and distribution part of our power business. And the latter two of those had good growth in the quarter. And that business is performing quite well for us. And their earnings were excellent in the quarter. And so we're very pleased. We got really good management in that business, and they're doing an excellent job. And it's now becoming a sizeable part of AMETEK, with over $0.5 billion in sales on an annual basis.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Great. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Matt.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Could you give me a sense of how the stronger dollar might be impacting your sales? And not just on the translation side, but are you seeing any international projects get delayed or pushed out? Or any pressure on your export sales? Just what impact might you be seeing outside of translation?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'm going to let David take this one.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. Yes, Matt, it's a great question. Fortunately, AMETEK is relatively balanced on revenues and costs around the world. But the strong dollar does cause some competitive situations in – we're in niche markets. We're leaders in niche markets and largely what we see is the delay of projects when people can't get the U.S. dollars necessary to go forward with projects. So they're usually delayed three months, six months to go back and get the money. This has happened before, and certainly we're seeing some of that. Because we're at the top of our niches and technology, we're not seeing a lot of negative impacts. But certainly, anytime the currency changes, there are some businesses that are impacted by the stronger dollar. The cases where we're manufacturing in the U.S. and we have competitors in Europe or Japan, the environment is tougher. Conversely, AMETEK does manufacture in Europe and Asia, and we have to take advantage of that to our competitive advantage. So it's certainly an issue, but I think we're managing it well. We've done an analysis business by business, every business unit in the company, and we have plans in place to relocate to lower-cost regions. As Frank mentioned, we have 24% of sales from new products. We're really emphasizing new product development to enhance our competitive advantage. So it's an issue for every company. There is a competitive issue with it, but we're managing it well.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then maybe on free cash flow, I know you're running below 100% conversion, and that's probably from the pension contribution. But CapEx is down 10% year-to-date. The plan's for it to be up 5% for the year. Are there specific projects in the back half of the year, or acquisitions? Do you have capital spending plans for those, or anything else that would drive a pretty big ramp in CapEx in the back half of the year?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes, actually, Bob and I discussed this recently, and I think it's unlikely that we're going to spend the $75 million in capital that we talked about. And part of the issue here, to be very upfront about it, is that the environment is tough, and our people are heavily focused on getting the revenue and getting the profit that we're looking for, so that it's just difficult to find the time to do some of the projects. So, I doubt very much that we're going to spend the full $75 million. In terms of free cash flow, usually in the first part of the year, we always run below net income. But, if we look at the full year and actually extract that $50 million in pension contributions that you've mentioned, we actually expect free cash flow to net income to be about 115% of sales. And that's probably a conservative number. I mean we're just throwing off significant cash and it's sort of a hallmark of AMETEK and the second half will be very strong in terms of cash generation.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. That all makes sense.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Joe.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Frank, first on EMG, you've called out Precision Motion Control as an area of strength for a while now. I think that business has pretty diverse end markets. So can you talk about where you're seeing the growth come from in particular?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I mean this is really a great business and we've got excellent management in this business. And the model for the business is a very interesting one because it's different than most of our other businesses, in that we have a number of platforms in the business. And what this team does is when a customer comes in and needs a special motor for a given application, we can take a platform that is closest to that requirement and basically design or with very little engineering solve that customer's problem. So from the viewpoint of the customer, he's getting a highly specialized motor, whereas we don't have to do a lot of engineering in order to make that happen. So this is, as you point out, very diverse. And what this business has recently done is expanded globally. They were predominantly a U.S. business, and with the acquisition of Dunkermotoren in Germany and real focus on growing in Asia, this company has diversified its global reach and it's basically looking at the stronger parts of the industrial market and being able to serve them well. So, to me, this is an example of really strong management in a difficult global macro environment that is actually taking advantage of their approach to the market, and therefore their organic growth has been very good.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. And then a couple questions on aero. There's been several companies that have indicated that they've seen some weakness in the business jet market here recently. It doesn't sound like you're seeing that? So can you just comment on your outlook there?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes...
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And on the EMG side of aero. I'm sorry, go ahead.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Very good question. People have talked about the turnaround in the business and regional jet market for about three years now, and they've all been wrong in terms of predicting an upturn. And actually we're not seeing a major market change in this business. My view of it is that we're sort of bouncing along bottom and I think what you're hearing from other companies is that there's a little bit of an uptick and then it comes back down, so you're sort of on that cycle of bouncing along bottom. Our growth here is purely not market-driven. It's from new product wins. We have major wins on HondaJet, for instance. We have major wins on other platforms like the Global Express, like Gulfstream aircraft. And you sum those and actually in the second quarter our business and regional jet business was up organically the most in AMETEK. It was up low-double digits. So it's all driven from platform wins, not market.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. And then just lastly on aero on the EMG side, can you talk about what you're seeing in third-party MRO and military? Again, there's been a lot of mix commentary this earning season, so...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes...
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: ...that's what you're seeing.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And I'm going to give you some mix commentary as well. In terms of military, this has been an absolute surprise for us that actually when we look at military across the company, that would be both EMG and what we do in EIG. It was up low-single digits. So we're actually growing organically in military. I would have bet a fair amount of money that that wasn't going to happen. But we'll take it. We need it. The third-party MRO was weak. It was weak in the quarter. We were actually down. But we also had a tough comparison, and if you look at the third-party MRO business overall, that market is growing 3% to 4%. That's basically the market dynamics right now. And we think that's the kind of growth that we're going to get and are getting, actually, if you look at it over a longer period of time. But the second quarter was weak.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please proceed.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Robert.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So the first question, Frank, is, you've spoken a lot about your cost initiatives and the fact that they could be fairly conservative, and so this question gets to that. If we get into even a worse macro environment, clearly there's some conservatism there, but would you take another whole look given the fact that you've already highlighted the strong payback you announced with your $16 million or so of initiatives in the first quarter? How should we think about it if we go into a cyclical rollover? What kind of cost saves or cost actions could you take?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: That's a really good question. And it really depends on how significant a downturn would be. We have sized the company as we think is appropriate for the guidance that we've provided to you, both in terms of overall sales, organic sales and what we're expecting for the second half. You used the term rollover. If we're talking about a slight degradation, we'll be able to handle that. You just look, for instance, at the price of oil in the last few days where it has gone a little bit lower than actually when we put our presentation together here, but when we looked at it we said, it's not going to be significant to us. It could be a little bit slower than what we expect and we'll deal with it. But if there's a major downturn – this is sort of the hallmark of AMETEK that there are always substantial things that you can do in the cost structure of a company. And our approach to our businesses where we're highly diversified with lots of manufacturing facilities, there are still opportunities for us to do more. We can do additional consolidation of facilities, we could be even more aggressive on our material cost reductions, we could move more production to low-cost locales, and if we got in a major downturn, we would shift some of our focus which, as Dave mentioned and I mentioned, is more right now on RD&E and the acquisition front, we would move even more of it to the cost side of the business. And if I can just look back historically during the 2008 and 2009 downturn, our margins at the operating level were down just a little over 100 basis points. We were top of class. You go to the recession before that, our profit margins were actually up in the downturn. So this is sort of the core competency of our company, and the basic answer to your question is if things get worse, we will do more. And we'll get the cost structure aligned with the revenue. I hope we don't have to do that, but we'll be able to do it.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Understood. The second question is around acquisitions in association with – you highlighted your kind of track record over the past two years in terms of the acquired revenues and how much capital you deployed. In terms of doing the post mortem of those acquisitions, have you seen a superior organic growth rate from those acquisitions versus the core portfolio? And you are a harsh grader of yourself internally, but I mean how would you kind of give yourself a grade in terms of the acquisitions that have kind of come through the past two years? And do you think there's a problem in terms of your acquisition selection in terms of organic growth?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't think so. We specifically have a focus on acquiring companies that are very high up the differentiation curve and, in general, the higher up the differentiation curve, the higher the organic growth of those companies. The issue is even when you roll through the acquisitions we've done, they're not a major part of the company. And some of that growth is also being muted by just the general macro conditions that we have talked a lot about on this call and most industrial companies are talking about. So I actually believe the organic growth of the companies that we acquired is higher than the base organic growth of the core business. And if we take the last one, the Cognex deal, Dave, you remember what it was, organic growth, before we acquired it, 5%, 6%, 7%? 6%?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It was 6%. Okay. 6% was the number. So yeah, that's a good number in this environment. And there that's just an example of the last one that we did.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: The third and final question, if you'll indulge me, is...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: ...basically – and then this will be it, I promise, is you have been able to execute on some reasonable multiples, particularly in this M&A environment, I mean, you look at some of the public multiples being paid right now for some of these businesses as companies kind of search for growth and wrestle with the kind of portfolio transformation. Clearly companies of slightly larger deciles than yourself, but there are some very healthy multiples being paid. Are you nervous, given the fact that you've executed some reasonable deals in terms of EBITDA and the specter of slower growth that there could be a bid-ask issue in you being able to get deals done in the back half? And because you'll probably be walking away from – because seller expectation is going have to moderated, I guess is my point.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, that's a great question, Robert. If you look at this, we parse the deals that we look at because, you're absolutely right, some deals are just going for ridiculous multiples, and when you look at paying 15 times or 17 times trailing to get a return on invested capital that meets a reasonable criteria, and in particular our criteria is, it's virtually impossible unless you've got super growth with the business and/or almost unbelievable types of cost synergies. So we will parse those deals and we won't even spend any time on them because we're not going to get the return on invested capital that we target. Now having said that, our acquisition program has really been fruitful; we put a solid team in place; they're doing a super job, and a lot of the deals that are coming to our attention are coming up on a proprietary basis. And as a result of that, we're able to pay reasonable multiples. And I can remember like the last two deals we bought, they were 9 times kind of deals. And we can say that's reasonable in an environment where some companies are going for 15 times, but on the other hand, 9 times is probably a point more than we've historically paid. So, there's just – you have to be cautious in terms of not overpaying for a business; and again, this speaks to the quality of our acquisition program, and our backlog is good right now. The free cash flow of the company this year is going to be on the order of $740 million. And my objective is to spend that free cash flow on acquisitions, and we're pretty much right on target. You look at what we've done in sort of the first half of the year, as Bob mentioned, we did $360 million, so we're right on target to spend that. And that's the best utilization of that capital, if we can take the free cash flow of the company, invest in businesses and then make them better, it's sort of a no-brainer from an economic analysis viewpoint. So no, I'm not overly worried about it. One good metric that I like to focus on is nopac (48:32) to total average capital. And you look at this, and although we probably shouldn't look at it on a quarter basis, but in the second quarter, that number was just under 14%. So you look at our cost of capital which, depending on how you value cost of capital, a reasonable number for us would probably be 8%. So you take 8% and you get no pac (48:58) to total capital of 14%, we're creating sizable value. And that's the name of the game is, you got to create value. So I hope that helps.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great narrative. Thanks, Frank.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Frank, so seeing a little bit of a transformation in how the macro cycle is playing out relative to the last couple of cycles. I'm wondering if you've seen any changes in competitive landscape of any of the businesses, and in particular, with respect to your categorization of the portfolio, is serving the top of the top of the markets served. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any mix down in solution selection to kind of mid-tier solutions by any of the customer bases?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, I think that's a fair question. And I think the right answer is definitely, in this kind of environment, you see customers pushing down to some degree because, either they don't have the capital to spend or they're trying to have the capital that they do have go across a wider selection of products. So yeah, I don't think there's any question but that's a part of the dynamic that's occurring here. But in general, our products are differentiated enough that it's not a sizeable impact on the business, but it's definitely a factor. And I think it's just normal, actually, when the global macro is weak.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, definitely appears subtle. We've seen bigger top-line changes. Yours barely changed. Also, just would like a reminder on what the organic surge in Asia was last year, and how that carries through the balance of this year?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, we had, last year, very big sales of our CAMECA products. These are very high-level systems. And there was very, very strong performance. And that business does cycle, as to where they get the business. And actually, in the first half of the year it wasn't even in China, a good part of that was in Japan. And this year we're not seeing that, so that had probably the most significant impact on the organic growth.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi Richard.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Frank, could you speak a little bit to orders, maybe what the order number was in the quarter and then, what the core order change was year-over-year?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, the core orders were $1.035 billion in the quarter. The book-to-bill was 1.03. If you exclude backlog in both this year's second quarter as well as last year's, so that you get a sort of an equal comparison. Overall orders were flat. And from a organic viewpoint, they were down just a titch, just a very small amount. So it's pretty consistent with the sales and the picture that we're painting.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I understand. Okay. And then also, I was trying to think, when you went through your comments on the two segments, in EIG, am I correct, is the Process portion of EIG, you commented that Oil & Gas was down as expected, but was the balance of that business a bit weaker? Is the expectations faded there a little bit on the Process side for EIG? Or no?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, not really. Dave, you want to take that one?
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: No, we had solid growth in Materials Analysis and our Ultra Precision Technology Division.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: It's probably Q2 and the Oil & Gas was weaker, but they essentially offset and we were flat.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I understand. And then also, just one quick question on the midstream and downstream Oil & Gas business, I know the expectation there was for a modest decline this year. Has there been any acceleration or deceleration again in the mid and downstream spend?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, that's exactly – we went out and checked this with our businesses, and factually in Q2, it was down slightly, and we queried our businesses about what they expected for the rest of the year, and that's the expectation. Now, as I mentioned, the price of oil has come down a little bit in the last two days and will that have an impact? It could have a modest impact and it could be a little bit weaker than what we're talking about, but again, when we discussed that actually this morning, we said, we've got the cost handled here, so we've got really good confidence on our earnings for the year.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And I recall the mid-downstream piece was expected to track down maybe 5%, upstream down 20%, and that's how you were weighting (54:32) for this 10% number, and that's those two...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Your numbers are close.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: It was 25% on the upstream and a few points on the mid and downstream piece.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. Okay. And then just one real last question; did you say that the FX impact on the EPS line was $0.02 in the quarter?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. And nice work in the quarter.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Richard.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors: Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Matt. Welcome back.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors: Thank you. Hey, I was hoping you could give a little bit of clarity as to the linearity you saw in terms of orders, and what you've seen in July. I would imagine you have a preliminary order number by now.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Through the second quarter, orders actually went up, so we saw a positive trend on orders. For July, we have orders and sales data. We don't have profitability data yet. We'll have that in another day or two. But on orders and sales, they were basically in line with the forecast that I've given you. So we have pretty good confidence going into the beginning at least of Q2 that the estimates are going to hold.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors: And then just with respect to Oil & Gas, is your sense, again thinking about linearity, is your business bottoming? Is it getting worse? And what sort of oil price do you feel we would need to see for your business, particularly on the upstream side obviously, to start to reaccelerate?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. That's a great question, and there's a lot of the data in the industry as to what's the price of oil where you'll see expansion. And I think our consensus is it's a number like $70 a barrel. If you get up to that $70-plus a barrel, you're going to start to see expansion. One of the reasons that I actually have not highlighted yet on this call as to why maybe AMETEK isn't seeing as significant an impact as some other companies is that we're not as, in terms of our content, we're not as much focused on fracking in the U.S. Our business is much more internationally focused. And as a result of that, the estimates that we put together at the beginning of the year are pretty much – are holding, basically.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors: And then just lastly, if you could, you have $145 million that you've committed to in terms of cost savings. You've mentioned several times there's upside to that. I guess, what could the upside scenario look like? And then could you remind us if $70 million comes from sourcing and procurement, what our major buckets are to get you to $145 million, please?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. On the $145 million, about $70 million is a result of activities that are directly sourcing-related. And that would include our strategic procurement initiatives. It even includes our value engineering activities where we will do some minor redesign of products and lower the material content as a result of that value engineering and value analysis work. So that's about $70 million of the $145 million. And the remaining, I guess, $75 million is all of the actions that we have done in terms of plant consolidations, reductions in force in those businesses that have had the most significant impact as a result of the macro environment, et cetera. In terms of the first part of your question, we have not actually rolled that up. But I think a number on the order of $10 million is very realistic.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors: Great. Thanks a lot, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And that gives you a flavor as to why we're comfortable with the estimate.
Matt Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors: Perfect. Thanks again.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Drew on for Nigel.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Nigel.
Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: This is Drew. But the...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Drew.
Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Could you just go back to the third-party MRO real quick, you mentioned the market's growing 3% to 4%. Do you have any sense for when that turns back positive for you guys?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think next quarter. Yeah, I think the reason the quarter was down was mainly due to the comparison that I talked about, so I think we're going to see some growth out of MRO next quarter.
Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just lastly on the organic growth in 3Q, could you just kind of clarify what you're looking for there? Kind of looks like the 1% to 2% implies could be down next quarter?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Flat. We're actually talking about a flat number. But yeah, I mean, if Oil & Gas gets a little bit worse, you might see a minus 1%, that's possible; but we're calling flat right now.
Drew J. Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time.

Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a very good start to 2015, with double-digit earnings growth and excellent operating performance. Since we were seeing the effects of a continued strong U.S. dollar and a sluggish global economy, we proactively took actions in the first quarter to mitigate these effects. These actions position us to deliver earnings in line with our initial guidance. The realignment costs in the quarter totaled $15.9 million or approximately $0.04 per diluted share. The savings resulting from this realignment is about $40 million in 2015 and $55 million on an annualized basis. We were very selective in these actions so our future growth will not be impacted. All financial results and commentary on the call today will be on an adjusted basis, excluding this realignment costs. Now on to the financial results. In the first quarter, sales increased 1% to $984.1 million. Organic growth was also up 1%, while acquisitions added 4% and foreign currency was a larger-than-anticipated 4% headwind in the quarter. Operating income for the first quarter increased 7% to a record $236.9 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was superb at a record of 24.1%, a 140-basis-point improvement over the first quarter of 2014. Net income was up 9% to $152.9 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 11% over last year's first quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Operating working capital was 18.2% of sales in the quarter. Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very good first quarter. For the quarter, sales were up 4% to $593.8 million, driven by solid organic growth in our Aerospace, Power and Industrial businesses, plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Zygo and AMPTEK. Internal growth was flat, while acquisitions added 7% and foreign currency was a 3% headwind. EIG's operating income increased 7% to $160.5 million, and operating margins were 27% in the quarter, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter. The Electromechanical Group also performed extremely well in the quarter. Overall sales were down 3% to $390.3 million. As a result of a 5% foreign currency headwind, organic sales were up 2%. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $88.5 million, and operating margins were superb at a record 22.7% in the quarter, up 190 basis points from the previous year. Now turning to our four growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. The solid and balanced execution of these growth strategies by our employees is the principal reason for our ongoing success. Each of these strategies will continue to play a key role in driving our growth. First, I will touch on Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. We continue to focus on operational improvements to help drive both our competitive and financial success. Our results this quarter reflect the tremendous impact of our Operational Excellence initiatives, as we were able to expand operating margins 140 basis points to a record 24.1%. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements and efficiencies through their businesses by leveraging the Operational Excellence tools we have put in place throughout the company. One such initiative is our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities, where we continue to deliver exceptional results. For all of 2015, we anticipate approximately $70 million in savings from our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. Overall, we now anticipate approximately $145 million of total Operational Excellence savings in 2015, up from our initial estimate of $105 million of total savings. This $40 million increase in Operational Excellence savings is driven by the realignment actions we started in the first quarter. Now moving to New Products. New product development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently increased our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2015, we expect to spend about $210 million on RD&E or approximately 5% of total sales. We're excited about some recent new product introductions. The new Talysurf i-Series surface and contour measurement tool from our Taylor Hobson business has been very well received since its recent launch. This high-resolution device offers automated, simultaneous surface and contour inspection. It features powerful software capabilities for the analysis of surface finish and form and a unique temperature compensation system that ensures consistent performance, regardless of the operating environment. Our TMC business recently introduced their latest new product, the Stage-Base 450. This product represents the latest generation of vibration and motion cancellation technology from TMC. The Stage-Base 450 was designed specifically to be the primary vibration cancellation system for high-precision semiconductor tools, an attractive high-growth market. It incorporates technical advances to compensate for building floor vibration while increasing semiconductor wafer processing throughput. Lastly, our Electronic Components and Packaging business, a leading provider of electronic and electromechanical packages for harsh environment applications, unveiled its most recent design breakthrough for microelectronic packaging. This design is a patent-pending S-Bend Feedthrough that provides high fidelity for radio frequency signals. The innovative design satisfies the need for higher frequencies and greater bandwidth in optical communications, with capability greater than 80 gigahertz. The market feedback on this new design has been very strong. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was strong at 22% of sales in the quarter, and that's up from 20% of sales in last year's first quarter. Now turning to Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion remains an important part of our long-term growth as we look to expand our presence in attractive, higher-growth market segments and geographies. We are making investments globally to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets. International sales represent 52% of our total sales in the quarter, and we continue to see strong growth in China, where first quarter organic growth was up mid-teens. Also, as part of our acquisition integration process, we identify opportunities for acquired businesses to leverage AMETEK's global infrastructure to help them quickly and efficiently expand globally. Acquired businesses have had tremendous success in expanding their global manufacturing, sales and service capabilities to penetrate new markets. One recent example is AMPTEK, which we acquired last August. AMPTEK is opening up a new service center in our ASUS (11:24) facility in Shanghai. This expanded capability has already led to three large orders for their x-ray fluorescent detectors from Chinese OEMs. Lastly, let me touch on Acquisitions. Over the last 21 months, we have completed eight acquisitions, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $460 million in sales. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2015, as we see this strategy as a key driver for the creation of shareholder value. It remains the primary focus of our strong cash flow. Our pipeline remains strong. We have the managerial and financial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our balance sheet, cash flow, and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. We will continue to capitalize on our strong core competency of acquiring and integrating high-quality businesses that allows us to expand our presence in attractive market segments. Turning to the outlook now for 2015. As a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar and a continued slow macro growth environment, we now anticipate overall 2015 revenue to be down slightly on a percentage basis from 2014. We expect organic growth to increase low single digits on a percentage basis, which is at the low end of our initial guidance range. Currency is expected to be approximately a 4% headwind. We continue to expect earnings for 2015 to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over last year's adjusted earnings per share. Overall second quarter 2015 sales are expected to be flat versus the second quarter of 2014. We expect our earnings to be approximately $0.63 to $0.64 per diluted share in the quarter, up 3% to 5% over last year's second quarter. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven Operational Excellence capability and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2015. So in summary, I'm very pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter. Despite a number of macro headwinds, we are very confident in our ability to execute our growth strategies and continue to deliver strong earnings growth. Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be very glad to answer your questions. Bob?
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a good first quarter, with very strong operating performance. I'll provide some further details. In the quarter, selling expenses were down slightly versus last year's first quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in the quarter, down from last year's first quarter level of 1.3%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 29.3% and in line with our expectations. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of an ongoing international tax planning activities. For 2015, we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.2% of sales in the first quarter. Strong working capital management remains a key priority. Capital expenditures were $14 million for the quarter. The full-year 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $35 million for the quarter. 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $145 million. In the first quarter, we made a $50 million contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan to offset lower discount rates and a change in the mortality tables. Excluding this contribution, operating cash flow was $172 million in the quarter, up 7% over last year's first quarter. And free cash flow was $158 million or 111% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income. Total debt was $1.67 billion at March 31, down slightly from the 2014 year end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $407 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio in March 31 of 27.9%. At March 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had a very good first quarter, and we are well positioned for 2015. Our ample financing capability and strong cash flows will continue to support our growth investments both organically and through acquisitions.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. Thank you, Bob. Susie, we're now happy to open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question coming from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Allison.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So we've been hearing a lot the past two weeks about sort of this pervasiveness of this oil and gas decline and sort of the tentacles reaching out into the industrial U.S. And obviously, you talked about the export impact, just given the foreign currency headwind. I mean what's the greatest impact in your mind to AMETEK right now? And I mean I guess based on your limited visibility, what can you see as we move to 2015 here?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well in terms of oil and gas, we had given you an estimate at the beginning of the year that we thought we were going to be impacted about $40 million in our overall sales as a result of the oil and gas downturn. And in fact, that estimate is holding. That's roughly what we're seeing from the oil and gas downturn. The effect is obviously significant on the upstream part of our business, but it's offset by really better performance or good performance in the midstream and downstream sector. Interesting, this morning that BP and Total introduced their earnings and their oil and gas businesses were down sizably but less than what estimates analysts had expected. And the reason was the same thing, that their midstream and downstream businesses were very strong. So I think we're paralleling the market, and it shows the diversification of AMETEK's portfolio where any single part of the portfolio, when it goes in decline, is not going to have that significant an impact on the overall business. So that's how I would characterize the Oil & Gas segment for us.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then just on investment growth in this environment, it seems like you pulled your RD&E down a little bit. Any others that you feel that you need to pull down near term, just given sort of the uncertainty?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Actually, it's a great question on RD&E because in essence, you're right that we had given a little bit higher number. But it's actually the result of the translation because of the change in currency. So the actual amount of activity worldwide in the company in terms of people working in the RD&E environment has not been substantially impacted. And we have been very selective in our realignments, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, not to impact our long-term growth. So that question is a great one. If you look at the realignment that we did, we focused it on the operating side of the company. I mean our factories and those parts of the business that will be impacted by a bit of a slower growth environment than what we had originally intended. So we have done some employment reductions. We have done some belt tightening. We have done some and will be doing some additional facility consolidations, but again, very selective not to impact our overall growth.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thanks so much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Allison.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Mike W. Sang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. It's actually Mike signing in for Nigel.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello.
Mike W. Sang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Had a quick question on the restructuring that you guys...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
Mike W. Sang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: The realignment that you guys announced. So could you give us a sense on how that phases through the year? So the $40 million that you alluded to, Frank, how much of that came in 1Q and how much of that do you expect in 2Q?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Virtually, none in the first quarter and fairly evenly split through the year. A little bit lighter in the second quarter but definitely gaining full steam in the third and the fourth quarters of this year.
Mike W. Sang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And just to piggyback a little bit on Allison's question. She mentioned pressure that's pervasive and export demand of the U.S. Is that something that you're seeing accelerate through the quarter? And if you can quantify that, that'd be great.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I wouldn't say accelerate through the quarter. When you look at the European economy in particular, with the dramatic change in the euro, obviously, anything that you are exporting into that environment is going to be less competitive with respect to local suppliers than it was. We're very fortunate in that our portfolio is extremely differentiated and we have not had to make significant concessions. But there's no question that the competitive issue does have an impact. It's just impossible to quantify. And I noticed that many other companies are not even talking about it, but I would clearly say it's having an impact on us but it's not that significant.
Mike W. Sang - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Awesome. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, coming from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. So I was just wondering if you could describe the linearity through the quarter and into April.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Actually, when you look at the linearity, it actually improved during the quarter. Looking at order input, order input did go up as we went through the quarter. So we feel relatively good about that. But still, when you consider the global macros, that's why we decided to take a very conservative view on organic growth for the year and why we decided to do the realignment that I've talked about.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And it sounds like the improvement was sort of gentle rather than a horrific January and a killer March, so to speak.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think that's fair. I'd love to use the word killer but it's not appropriate.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Right. And any surprising divergences among end markets or geographies?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. I would say there's not amazing change. It's just that when you look outside the United States, you look in Europe, obviously, that economy remains weak. Asia is still good but it's not as good as it has been. And that's being offset by a stronger U.S. economy. Our organic growth was actually up nicely in the United States, so the issues we're seeing are largely offshore and largely focused in really Asia and Europe.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just on the restructuring, a couple angles I wanted to ask about. One, as we move into the year is the thought that the restructuring payback sort of takes the baton from belt tightening in the earlier part of the year. And then the second one would be, given all the acquisitions you've done over the past several years, is there maybe an opportunity to take a larger realignment position this year?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No, I don't feel the necessity to do any larger realignments. With that we've done, I've got significant confidence in the earnings and the guidance that we provided to you. So I feel we've taken a conservative view of the top line, and that has led to this restructuring and that something would have to radically change in the global environment in order for us to be required to do more. In terms of opportunity, absolutely. There is significant opportunity that we see, given the global environment, so you might just as well take advantage of it. We are looking at a number of acquisitions. Several of them have high European content, and you just take advantage of the global situations as they develop. And we're not going to change our strategy at all in terms of continuing a focus on the international environments. It's just that they're a bit weak right now, but that will change over time.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Sounds pretty good, Frank. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, coming from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Matt.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: So the commentary about the strength across geographies was definitely helpful. I wonder if you could do something similar about end markets because I know the organic revenue outlook isn't down dramatically, but you're towards the low end of the range. And it sounds like oil and gas maybe might not be the culprit there. So anything you can point to on the end market side that has organic growth coming in kind of towards the low end?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean if you look across our businesses and take a look at EIG, for instance, our Aerospace and Power and Industrial businesses performed very well in the quarter. But our Process businesses were the ones that weakened and what caused us to take a more conservative view on the organic growth. And obviously, the oil and gas impact that I talked about is in that Process segment. But in addition, when we look at the weakened U.S. economy – or excuse me – Europe economy and the weakened or slowing Asia economy, that has, across our businesses, the most significant effect on our Process businesses. So that was the key factor in why our organic growth in the EIG part of the business was a bit down from where we thought it was going to be at the end of the first quarter. So I think if you focus on the Process businesses, you focus on the global part of the Process businesses because a major part of those businesses in terms of percentage is higher than our other businesses outside the U.S. That is a predominant area in the company that took the impact.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And switching gears a little bit to the M&A pipeline, it's been a few quarters since the deal and I know it's always lumpy. You have plenty of balance sheet capacity, obviously. Anything on just seller expectations or the marketplace or what you're able to uncover? Just any update on what you're seeing on the M&A space would be helpful. Thanks.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No, I see our strategy of continuing to do acquisitions, as Bob and I both mentioned, our opening remarks, is the prime use of our cash flow. And I'm quite optimistic about being able to do additional deals and deploy a significant amount of capital in this fiscal year. I can tell you we're actively working on deals as we speak. It's hard to predict when and if a deal is going to close, but I would be surprised if you didn't hear from us throughout the year.
Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. It sounds good. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, coming from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone. How's everybody doing?
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good. Hi, Rob.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Fine. Thanks, Rob.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good, good, good. So I guess on the M&A question, maybe to come at it from a slightly different direction. Part of the problem on the opportunity for you on the M&A front is presumably, you're looking at the properties that have a lot of European exposure and then also probably a lot implied petrochem exposure. Maybe not directly, but there's going to be a sizeable part of their end markets that are going to serve those end markets or those businesses. So how does that kind of inform your – the bid ask around what you're trying to do in terms of acquiring some of these companies? Because clearly, even if you think your own core oil and gas exposure's manageable, in terms of the rhetoric, in terms of getting deals on the goal line, you're going to be fairly adamant about giving companies with oil and gas exposure a bit of a haircut in terms of the valuation. How do you see that playing out in terms of your opportunity set and your ability to close on some of these properties?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean if you specifically take the question on oil and gas, again, as I mentioned, the oil and gas exposure for AMETEK is not that significant. And so when we look at our portfolio of deals, many of the deals we're looking at do not have oil and gas exposure. Having said that, I view it as an opportunity with companies that have oil and gas exposure. And that we're going to pay a multiple based on their earnings and the expectations that we see, and we're very good at actually putting cycles in our models. We don't assume wherever a business is that that's going to be exactly what's going to happen in the future. So in oil and gas, we value these, take into account their cyclicality. And some companies need to sell, so they're going to sell at a point that maybe isn't desirable for them, since the pricing could be a bit lower, but obviously is an opportunity for us. So I'm not shy about doing an acquisition in oil and gas. You just have be clear in terms of what the projected earnings of that company is going to be. But I would say, just to reiterate, looking at our portfolio of acquisitions and some of the ones we're working on now, one of them, there's no oil and gas exposure. The other one, there's a little bit. So that's maybe the best way that I can characterize your question.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. I mean to be clear, just to close the loop here, I think you would argue with my premise that a lot of your M&A pipeline is tied to oil and gas-related properties.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Exactly.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then in terms of the restructuring, I mean you've given a lot of detail around kind of the benefits you expect to see. Have you talked specifically about a payback in association with the restructuring? And maybe you could just give a little bit of complexion around maybe the cash, non-cash in association with it and where you're spending on in terms of logistics, procurement or plant or people. How should we think about some of the complexion in the restructuring?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean you look at the amount of cost that we're taking, it's basically $16 million in one-time cost, which is roughly $0.04 a share. And as I said, the annualized benefit from this is $55 million. So you look at the payback and it is extremely good, and that's because of the type of realignment – I really don't want to use the word restructuring because this isn't what I would call a major restructuring. It's a realignment. The return on this investment is absolutely incredible, and we just felt it was necessary to do. In terms of your question on cash versus non-cash, Bob, can you answer that?
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Essentially, the entire $15.9 million is cash. There's a little bit of non-cash in there. But again, this was focused on reduction in force as well as the kinds of operating opportunities that we can get cost out of the business. So it's not in the context of asset breakdown. This is true cost potentially that we're going to see immediately, and that's why you see the payback showing up so quickly.
Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Well, I guess I'll see you guys soon enough. And good luck with the rest of the day.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, coming from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: Hey. So I wanted to – and Bob gave me some of the answers to the questions I was looking for the RIFs (35:02) and the operating cost focus. Could you talk about which businesses these are maybe more focused on? Because this realignment is not typical AMETEK. It's a little bit different than we've seen for quite some time. I'd go back, I think, to the last downturn. Maybe tell us, Frank, kind of how you're thinking of this, how you conceived it because it is a little bit different than what you usually do. What business is most affected? And importantly, does this hurt the prospect of that $100 million productivity in out years from here?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Scott, yeah. I mean I think what I will say is that when we looked at all of the macro environment issues that are going on right now that most companies are reporting, most companies took down their guidance. And I look at this that when I give a guidance range, there is a commitment from us to make those estimates. And that's really embodied in the culture and the approach that AMETEK has taken for many, many years. So as we saw the growth prospects coming down by a few points, we just didn't wait around. We're going to take actions and we're going to realign. And I can sit here and with confidence tell that our earnings are going to occur within the range that I talked about and hopefully above that range. So I mean that's sort of the top line premise. We looked at our businesses in light of where we were seeing the change in organic growth from our initial estimates. And obviously, we've already talked about the Process businesses. So we took some actions there. We took some actions in EMG. But the way we looked at it is, where are the businesses that are looking at a lower growth than what they originally had talked about? So your comment about this is different, I guess from the viewpoint that we haven't done it since 2008 or 2009, it's probably correct. But if you look at the Zygo acquisition we did and are doing a lot of realignment there. And if you go back in history, we just have a very strong commitment to making the earnings numbers. And when we see an issue, we deal with it. And you just don't let the issue get behind you, in essence; you get in front of it. And that's what we did, and so I hope that helps with your question.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: It does, indeed. The simple follow-up I would have is, I guess, is not so simple is if you can kind of do your thing, Frank, with the businesses and kind of how the sales rolled out and expectations roll out from here.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure. I'd be glad to do that. So if we start with EIG in Aerospace, EIG, Aerospace had a very good first quarter with organic sales up mid single digits, reflecting strong growth in our regional and business jet business and the continued solid growth in our commercial OEM business. Organic orders were also very strong in the quarter, up low double digits. And we're very pleased with the continued strong performance in EIG, Aerospace. This business is well-positioned to continue to drive strong growth, given key wins on a number of next-generation commercial aircraft, including the A350, the 787 and the C919 as well as a number of business and regional jet platforms including HondaJet, Global Express and Agusta. For all of 2015, we expect EIG, Aerospace sales to be up mid single digits, driven by the continued ramp-up of these key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. We've already talked a bit about our Process businesses. Organic sales in the Process businesses were down low single digits in the quarter. That was against a difficult prior-year comparison. In 2015, we expect organic sales to be up low single digits over 2014. And as I've mentioned, we've reduced our full-year growth estimates for the Process businesses as a result of the impacts of the stronger U.S. dollar and a slow global macro environment. Power and Industrial had a good first quarter. Organic sales were up mid single digits with solid growth across both our Power and Industrial businesses. And for 2015, we expect organic sales for Power and Industrial to be up low-single digits. So if you look at all of EIG then, we expect organic sales for the year to be up low single digits on a percentage basis. Scott, moving to the other part of AMETEK, EMG, our differentiated EMG businesses had a good first quarter. Organic sales were up low single digits, driven by solid growth in our Precision Motion Control and Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging businesses. And for 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up low single digits organically. And last part of our company, our legacy businesses, Floorcare and Specialty Motors. Organic sales in our Floorcare and Specialty Motors businesses were flat in the first quarter. For all of 2015, we expect this business to be up low single digits organically. And I'd like to mention that the management team, in particular, in Floorcare and Specialty Motors, is really doing an excellent job in this business. So if you sum those two parts of EMG, Scott, for all of 2015 for EMG, we expect organic growth of low single digits on a percentage basis. And then lastly, if you take EIG and EMG, as I mentioned in my opening comments, for all of AMETEK, we expect low single-digit organic growth for the year conservatively, I would say.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC: Frank, thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, coming from the line of Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Joe.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: In terms of the second quarter revenue guidance, flat overall, how does that break out by segment on an organic basis, Frank?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. It's going to be roughly the same for each of the segments in the second quarter. I don't see a significant difference between the two segments.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then the margins in EMG, I mean record performance there. Is that how we should think about that segment going forward and in the second quarter, kind of assuming the revenue growth environment? Or was there some favorable mix there or some other dynamic that doesn't necessarily repeat?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I'll let Dave take that question.
David A. Zapico - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I don't think it's a mix issue that won't repeat. There's been really strong cost management in EMG, and the margins that you see are more indicative of the future. So we expect to expand margins in EMG more so than EIG, but it will continue.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And just to expand, Joe. I think if you look at all of AMETEK now, we're going to see really superb margin performance this year. We're going to be year-over-year, I would say, well above 100 basis points of operating income margin improvement. So Dave and his team have done just a phenomenal job on the performance of both of these businesses, both EIG and EMG. And the margin performance is truly superb.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then lastly for me, I mean you mentioned China organically, your revenue was up mid-teens. But you also talked about the, obviously, the slowing economy there. So – and you touched on this a little bit in your prepared comments, but can you talk more about what's driving that? Is it just the growth initiatives that you're instituting there? And what's your outlook for China going forward for this year and beyond?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Okay. It's a great question. If you look at the first quarter, there was a bit of an anomaly in our results in that when you look at last year, we had huge benefits from Abenomics in Japan. So therefore, the results in China, which were very good, were offset by the results in Japan, in essence. And we still consider the Far East and in particular, China, very good regions of the world in terms of investment. We are not changing our investment strategy at all. We're going to continue to put manufacturing capability and sales and service capability in that part of the world. The difference is that this – we were reporting overall for Asia growth numbers that were extremely high for the last couple years and now they're going to be more modest. You look at the GDP in China. It, at points, was running 10%, 11%. Now they're forecasting 7%. So you compare that 7% GDP with the U.S. and Europe, it's still the fastest-growing part of the world but it's not growing at the same rate. And that's the way that we are viewing that part of the world. It's still a great place to invest, but it's not growing at the rates that it was.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, Frank. Thanks, Dave.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, coming from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Good morning, gentlemen.
Kevin C. Coleman - Vice President-Investor Relations: Hi, Mark.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Mark.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Bob, what were payables in the quarter?
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: $381 million.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: $381 million. Thank you. What were orders in backlog?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Orders were $944 million. They were overall down 5.5%. Organically, they were actually up low single digits. And the currency impact here was huge. It was 8%. And the reason is that you obviously have to readjust the backlog as the currencies have so dramatically changed. If you look at the total backlog, it's now $1.2 billion, essentially flat with where it was at the beginning of the year.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: How much of that backlog was due to currency?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: 8%. I mean, well the backlog. That's a different...
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Percent of backlog?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. You have to do 8% of $1.2 billion. No. No. The U.S. part of – it was not all of it. But why not, instead of us guessing here, why don't we get to that answer? It's 8% of the part of the backlog that obviously is international, and we don't have that right here at our fingertips.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. You can follow up. And then, Frank, on the realignment spending $16 million and getting $55 million in annualized benefits is pretty huge. It's a hard number to fathom on $16 million of spend. I guess it begs the question, why wouldn't you have done it sooner if the returns are this strong?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: You're always – that's a great question. And first of all, the return is as good as it is, predominantly because it is related to severance cost. And therefore, the return, as Bob said, is immediate and it's quick. And you get an excellent return on that. And in terms of your other question, basically, as you know, every year, we try to balance the cost reductions with other things that we are doing. We always have a large number. If you look historically over the last few years, we talked about $100 million of improvements. And again, as we saw the macro situation, we decided to get more aggressive. We always have a list of things that we can do, and we balance that based on the environment. And in this case, as we saw the slowing sales, as just about every industrial company is seeing, we recognized that we weren't going to be shipping as much from our operating facilities. So therefore, we took action. I mean it's pretty straightforward and pretty simple. If we were going to be shipping at a higher level, then we wouldn't have done it.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Right, right. Even with that lower guidance, it's still a pretty big number and you already run pretty lean. So it's just surprising that you're able to find so much. So – but that's a good number.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: We're good at this.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: All right. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question, coming from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes. A couple things. Frank, the reduction in the core growth for 2015 in the EMG business, kind of comes in that technical motor space. It looks like the cost-driven business is kind of intact in terms of what their expectation was. Is the technical motors piece, is that being influenced by that $100 million of revenue that is kind of sprinkled throughout technical motors from the energy business? Is that where you'd be able to identify some softness there?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. No question, Rick. If you look at those businesses in the differentiated part of EMG, they also have global market exposure. And what we're seeing is as those economies are weaker, Europe, weak; Asia, not quite as strong as it was, there's an impact there as well. So, yes, we have indeed looked at our thoughts around that differentiated segment. And it's also lower by a couple of points.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And just to back up a little bit, there was a reference earlier about exports. And obviously, I think most appreciate the competitiveness or lack of when the dollar strengthens like it has.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Right.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): But can I ask you, I mean what percentage of your sales are exports from U.S. to Europe? And then secondly, is there a price component there? Or is it – again, your products are so differentiated, I can't imagine that switching costs aren't awfully high. So do you have to price more competitively there just because of the strength of the dollar?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: In general, not, I would say, in terms of the pricing impact. We have made, in some of our – I would call it less differentiated products, we have made some minor adjustments in pricing. But in general, the differentiated part of our portfolio is definitely strong enough that we don't have to do substantial reductions in price. Now having said that, you look at Europe, the economy is not good. It's the weakest of the three general, major economies in the world. And it's impossible to distinguish between whether or not they're – what the impact of the competitiveness issue is from the fact that it's just a slowing economy. So we can't put a number on it. I don't think anybody can really put a number on it. So – but to say it's not there would be naïve. So we know there is some of that. I don't think it's substantial. And we're really talking about a couple points change here. It's not like we're talking about a 10% change.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. And just price capture overall in the first quarter?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, it's good question. It was 1.5% price capture. And when we rolled up all inflation cost to our best ability – it's not a perfect roll-up. But if you take that roll-up and you look at price minus inflation, it's about 0.6%. So we continue to get good pricing and we continue to bring it to the bottom line at a rate higher than inflation. And that's a key thing that we look at and manage.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And just one last question. Was Zygo's revenue in the quarter where you expected or at plan? The total acquisition contribution looks somewhat light to us. Maybe could you just address that?
Robert R. Mandos - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Rick, you can't really peanut butter the revenue across quarters. It's a lumpy business and it met our expectation for the first quarter.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Mr. Coleman, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.

We will begin with prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Frank.
Frank Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a strong fourth quarter to complete another excellent year. In the quarter on an adjusted basis we established records for operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we incurred additional Zygo integration costs of approximately $0.01 per diluted share. Including the costs from the third quarter, total Zygo integration costs in 2014 are approximately $0.05 per diluted share. The additional fourth-quarter integration costs increases the expected Zygo synergy benefit from $15 million to $20 million. All financial results and commentary on the call today will be on an adjusted basis excluding these integration costs. Now, onto the full year and fourth-quarter results. For the full year 2014, we established records for essentially all key financial metrics including orders, sales, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating cash flow. Sales were up 12% for the year; orders were up 13%; operating income was up 13%; operating margins were 22.8%; and diluted earnings per share ended at $2.42, a 15% increase over 2013's diluted EPS. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 9% to $1.02 billion. Organic growth was up 2% against a very difficult comparison in the fourth quarter of 2013 while acquisitions added 9% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. Organic growth in the fourth quarter was excellent with broad-based strength across our businesses. Overall orders were up 10%, and organic sales were very strong, up 7% on orders. Operating income for the fourth quarter was very strong. It increased 10% to a record $232.3 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was also very strong at 22.7%, a 40 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013. Net income was up 14% to $155.2 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 15% over last year's fourth quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow was $213.3 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, cash flow was $726 million, up 10% over 2013. Free cash flow was excellent at 125% of net income in the fourth quarter and 112% of net income for the full year. And working capital was also very good at 17.1% of sales in the quarter. Included in our fourth-quarter results is approximately $0.02 per diluted share of realignment costs which will contribute an approximate $0.04 per diluted share benefit in 2015 and $0.06 per diluted share benefit in 2016. Considering these of realignment costs, the quality of earnings in the fourth quarter was excellent. Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments group had a very strong fourth quarter and an excellent year. For the quarter sales were up 14% to $644.4 million driven by strong growth in our aerospace business plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions. Internal growth was up 1% on a very difficult comparison while acquisitions added 14% and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. EIG's operating income increased 11% to $168.1 million, and operating margins were 26.1% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, EIG operating margins were up 70 basis points over last year's fourth quarter. The Electromechanical group also had a very good quarter. Sales were up 1% to $379.8 million on strong growth in our precision motion control and engineered materials interconnect and packaging businesses. Organic sales were up 3%, and foreign currency was a 2% headwind. EMG's operating income increased 9% to $77 million, and operating margins were very strong at 20.3% in the quarter, up 150 basis points from the previous year. Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product developments, and strategic acquisitions. First I will touch on acquisitions. We had a very active the year acquiring 5 businesses including Teseq, VTI Instruments, Luphos, Zygo, and AMPTEK. We deployed approximately $575 million in capital and acquired roughly $285 million in revenue in 2014. Over the last 18 months we acquired 8 businesses, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $460 million in annual revenue. The integration of these acquired this is going very well. In addition to driving operational improvements and efficiencies through leveraging our global capabilities we are focused on achieving sales, market, and technology synergies between the acquired businesses and our existing businesses. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2015 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our balance sheet, cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity also to pursue this strategy. Now turning to global and market expansion. Global and market expansion continues to be an important contributor to our growth as we are increasingly expanding our presence in attractive, higher growth market segments and geographies. International sales represented 54% of our total sales in the fourth quarter and 55% of our total sales for the full year. We continue to make investments globally to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities, and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets. Providing customers with high-quality service capabilities is increasingly being viewed as a key differentiator for our product sales especially in China, India, and Southeast Asia. These investments are yielding strong results. In 2014 we saw excellence growth across the brick regions with overall growth of 17% and organic growth up 10%. China was a key driver of this growth up 13% organically in 2014. Now moving to new products. New product development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently grown our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2014 we spent approximately $210 million on RD&E which was up 17% from 2013, and in 2015 we expect to spend approximately $220 million. I'll now talk about some new product introductions that we've recently done. AMETEK process instruments business recently launched our latest sulfur recovery analyzer the model 888 tail gas analyzer. AMETEK is the clear market leader in sulfur recovery analysis with over 1000 analyzers installed worldwide with more than 100 million hours of run time. With the introduction of the new model 888 analyzer we have taken sulfur recovery analysis to the next level. Our third generation analyzer offers advanced predictive diagnostics, remote PC Web-enabled interface, and enhanced safety features. In addition, it automatically detects and takes immediate corrective action in response to commonly encountered external failure modes in the sulfur recovery process. AMETEK's vision research business introduced its new Phantom Miro C series high speed digital video cameras at the North American automotive testing Expo in late 2014. These compact video cameras feature a ruggedized design with the ability to withstand shocks up to 170 G's. This makes it the ideal choice for any number of extreme applications including onboard automotive crash testing. Digital high-speed video serves one of the most valuable tools researchers have in conducting crash test analysis, and the new Miro C series offers performance and image quality unsurpassed by our competition. Lastly, AMETEK EDAX recently launched their first product incorporating key technology acquired as part of the recent AMPTEK acquisition. AMPTEK, which we acquired in 2014, provides x-ray and gamma ray detectors used to identify the composition of materials. Utilizing AMPTEK's fast silicon drift detector technology, this new elemental analysis system delivers a compact and lightweight product that provides a level of measurement performance including resolution and output count rates that aligns extremely well with many industry applications. This new product is targeted at the industrial energy dispersive spectral analysis market and the tabletop scanning electron microscope market, both target markets for EDAX expansion. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was excellent at 25% of sales in the quarter and 23% for the full year. This reflects the tremendous work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. Lastly, I will touch on operational excellence. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for AMETEK. Our focus on cost and asset management remains a key driver to both our competitive and financial success We continue to see tremendous results from our operational excellence initiatives as is evidenced by our record operating performance, strong operating margins and excellent working capital levels. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the operational excellence tools we have in place throughout the Company. OpEx includes lean manufacturing, six sigma in our factories and back-office operations, design for six sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, movement of production to low cost locales, and value engineering. Overall, we realized approximately $100 million in savings in 2014 through our various operational excellence initiatives. The largest contributor to this was our global sourcing office and strategic procurement activities where we recognized $19 million in savings in the fourth quarter and over $70 million in savings for all of 2014. For 2015, we expect approximately $110 million in total savings through our operational excellence initiatives including $70 million in savings through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. Included in this over 2000 – overall 2015 savings amounts is approximately $13.5 million of savings from the realignment costs included in our fourth-quarter results. Turning now to the outlook for 2015, we expect our businesses overall to show solid growth during 2015 with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We anticipate 2015 revenue to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2014. Organic growth is expected to be up low- to mid-single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2015 are expected to be in the range of $2.58 to $2.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 9% over 2014 reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our operational excellence initiatives and the benefit of contributions from recent acquisitions. First-quarter 2015 sales are expected to be up mid-single digits from last year's first-quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.61 to $0.63 per diluted share, up 7% to 11% over last year's first quarter. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2015. So in summary, our overall businesses performed very well in the fourth quarter and in 2014 producing records for essentially all key financial metrics on an adjusted basis. Our team did an excellent job navigating the modest worldwide growth environment. We were able to deliver exceptional operating results through a focus on executing our growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our significant cash flow generation provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. We remain committed to making sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. We really look forward to another successful year in 2015. Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be very glad to answer your questions.
Bob Mandos: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had an excellent fourth quarter with strong operating performance and an excellent quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, organic selling expenses were up less than organic sales on a percentage basis. General and administrative expenses were up 8% over last year's fourth quarter driven by a contribution to the AMETEK charitable foundation in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales in line with last year's fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, total other expenses were down approximately $4.5 million versus the fourth quarter of 2013. This $0.01 per diluted share benefit was more than offset by realignment costs of $0.02 per diluted share taken in the fourth quarter, resulting in a high quality of earnings. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.1% essentially in line with last year's fourth quarter of 27.2%. We are very pleased with the success of our ongoing international and state tax planning initiatives. For 2015 we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year rate. Overall, our quality of earnings was excellent in the quarter. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was a very strong 17.1% of sales in the fourth quarter and 17.6% for the full year. We remain one of the top performers in our peer group, and our working capital performance is a direct reflection of the tremendous strides our business units have taken in driving towards operating excellence. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $71 million for the full year. Full year 2014 capital expenditures were 1.8% of sales. 2015 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $75 million. Depreciation and amortization was $36 million for the quarter and $139 million for the full year. 2015 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million. Our cash flow was excellent in the quarter and for the full year. Operating cash flow for the quarter and full year were records. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $213 million, and free cash flow was $189 million, representing 125% of net income. Full-year operating cash flow was $726 million, up 10% over 2013, and full-year free cash flow was $65 million or 112% of net income. Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy where we expended approximately $575 million on transactions in 2014. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of stock for approximately $243 million. These repurchases were in line with our stated strategy to offset the dilutive impact of our benefit plans with optimistic share repurchases. Total debt was $1.7 billion at December 31, up approximately $300 million from 2013 year end driven largely by acquisitions and share repurchases. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $378 million resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at December 31 of 29.2%. At December 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had an outstanding 2014 establishing records for essentially all the key financial metrics. We are well positioned for further growth both organically and through acquisitions with a strong balance sheet and cash flow.
Frank Hermance: Great. Thank you, Bob. Frank, we will now open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Allison Poliniak: Hi, guys. Good morning. 
Frank Hermance: Hello, Allison.
Allison Poliniak: Obviously we can't let this call get away without talking about energy. Frank, can you give us a sense of what you're seeing out there today and how we should think about 2015 in the parameters of what you talked about with guidance?
Frank Hermance: Sure, Allison. In essence, we have included in our estimates what we believe is going to be the impact of oil prices falling to the levels that they're at which is obviously a very depressed level. If you look at our business, we have about $125 million of our business that is focused on upstream oil and gas. And in total if you look at the amount of business when you include the downstream and the midstream piece, it's about $400 million. We've done a roll up. We estimate that the impact on our business is going to be about $40 million in sales. As I mentioned, that's included in our estimates. The majority of that is in that $125 million upstream part of the business. So we believe we have the impacts covered. There will be a counter effect that's positive that is difficult to predict in terms of exactly what the magnitude will be, but there should obviously be a positive impact on the US economy that should result from this reduction in oil prices. But we haven't assumed any of that in our estimates.
Allison Poliniak: That's great. Just touching on your EBIT expectations for 2015. We continue to hit new highs. How should we think about 2015 just given the mix of your business now?
Frank Hermance: Another great question, Allison. We have rolled up, in a very detailed manner, the budget for 2015, and although our margins are very good and very high, we do expect that we can continue to expand margins, and we are estimating a 30 to 40 basis point improvement in margins for 2015 over 2013 or 2014. And the drivers for that are really 2 things. One, is the fact that we expect organic growth in 2015 to basically have a very high contribution margin going to the bottom line. As you've heard us speak before, our contribution margins are very good. In 2014, the actual contribution margin for the Company was actually greater than 40%. We have told you to estimate 35% for our contribution margins, but we tend to outperform that, so you take that organic growth and that will go to the bottom line through that contribution margin and thus that will be a lift on the margin performance of the Company. The second thing is our very aggressive cost reduction activities. You heard in my opening comments that we're, I would say, conservatively expecting $110 million of cost improvements going through the P&L in 2014. We've been aggressive on the cost side. You heard the $0.02 of realignment costs that we put in the fourth quarter. As we saw the price of oil go down and we saw some of the FX impacts, we decided to take a bit aggressive stance in terms of additional cost reductions. So we're pretty confident in that $110 million of savings, and you sum those 2 and that leads to basically the 30 to 40 basis points of margin improvement.
Allison Poliniak: Perfect. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Baliotti with Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed.
John Baliotti: Good morning.
Frank Hermance: Hi, John.
Dave Zapico: Hi, John.
John Baliotti: Hey, Frank. Obviously a lot of the strategic M&A activity over the years has been in EIG, but EMG's performance in 2014 was very solid. I'm sure you're aware of that. You've always been – the Company's always been very consistent with the outlook for the year, so I was just wondering how does that – the operational focus and the benefits that you've gotten this year – how does that position in terms of manageability of the operations in this environment? It's obviously a tougher year I think than we expected.
Frank Hermance: I think that's right. I think everybody looking at 2015 now versus just a few months ago are seeing headwinds if you're in the general industrial space as we are. And we feel this positions us in a very, very positive way. We are very, very good at cost and asset management. You just heard me talk to Allison about the basic improvements we're going to put through the P&L which helps when the economic environment is not as strong as we would all like on a worldwide basis. And we view it as a great time to be aggressive in the acquisition front. We've got plenty of cash flow as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks. We're going to focus on acquisitions, and we believe there are good targets out there that we can buy at reasonable multiples, add value to, and continue the growth of the Company through both organic and acquisition type of activities.
John Baliotti: So to that point, I know you've done a number of the deals especially in the aerospace area have been complementary where they fit in nicely. The are nice tuck ins with their current operations. Does the environment – does that strengthen the conversation you have with other companies where they might be more focused might, be more concentrated in an area? Does that open up the conversation a little bit more now given this environment than maybe a year ago?
Frank Hermance: I think in general I would say if I look back in history, obviously we've been doing deals for many, many years and what tends to happen when the global economic environment is sort of difficult, many companies decide it's a good time to buy – or sell. So it's a great time for us to look at buying those companies. We continually and think you know, John, we've got a team here that nourishes deals, works with companies over an extended period of time and on occasion they will just come to us and say – hey, now we are ready. And I think the global economic environment will foster some of that.
John Baliotti: Great. Thanks very much.
Frank Hermance: All right, John. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Matt McConnell: Thank you. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Hi, Matt.
Matt McConnell: So, the 4.7 million shares that you repurchased in the quarter, is that more than you would need to offset dilution? And I wonder if based on the cash flow and the balance sheet, could you enter a period where you do both buybacks and acquisitions? I know obviously acquisitions are the primary use of capital, but do you have enough flexibility to do both going forward or is this more of a one-time repurchase?
Frank Hermance: Yes, if you look with the amount of shares that we bought back, the 4.7 million shares, and you look back over the last few years, we have not bought back any shares. As Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, we do that opportunistically. We felt that the stock price actually didn't move as well as one would expect in 2014 given our truly superlative performance. So we took advantage of that. And in essence, that 4.7 million shares does offset the dilution if you look back over a number of years. We're not changing our strategy. We are basically going to focus on acquisitions as you said. Would it be possible in the future that we take some of the capital and buyback more shares? I never want to say no, but that's really not our thrust. We think that we can create the most value for shareholders by basically buying companies and making them better and getting the synergies with our present operating units. So there is no present intent to do some type of major buyback. Also implied in your question is, do we have the flexibility if we wanted to do some buybacks along with doing acquisitions? Absolutely. The cash flow of the Company is superlative as Bob mentioned. There's a significant amount of capital that we have available to us. So we are not capital constrained. And if we got to a point where there weren't as many deals on the table as we would like, we would surely consider it. But it's not our present thought process.
Matt McConnell: Since we have Dave on the call, maybe I can touch on a business which I think you should know well, just a status update on Zygo. So maybe give us a sense of what kind of margin improvement has been driven there over your 6 or 7 months owning it. And I know that this probably has margin potential above the AMETEK average, so there are probably some big initiatives left on the integration front. So can you walk us through what the priorities are and maybe the timeframe for reaching what you think is the margin potential at Zygo?
Dave Zapico: Sure. As Frank mentioned earlier, we took an additional $5 million of costs to get – increase our benefits that we're going to get from Zygo at about $20 million in cost synergy. And we are very pleased with the progress and integration we've had so far. When we bought the business, the margins were in the low teens, and we ended the year in the mid-teens and at the end of 2015 we expect to be in the high teens. And as you said, we expect it to be above the AMETEK average when we are done. We are really seeing efficiency in all areas that we can improve the business. The most – the biggest change that you see right now is we have put a new management team in place. There's an AMETEK P&L leader and an AMETEK finance leader at the business. And they've gone through and put a new work structure in place that brings P&L accountability to the business. I think that long-term, we're very bullish with the Zygo technology and the AMETEK financial discipline and OpEx we're going to have a great return for shareholders.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Christopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. 
Frank Hermance: Hi, Christopher.
Christopher Glynn: Hey. Just wanted to dive into the current state of the pipe line, Frank if you could, talk a little bit about the relative degree of actionability across the size ranges and then in particular if any of the deals over the past couple of years are really supporting their own active pipeline.
Frank Hermance: Yes, actually hat's a great question, Chris. The pipeline remains good in terms of size of deals. We are looking at deals that spread all the way from technology deals where the revenue is not all that significant to what I would say are the typical sized deals for AMETEK which would be in that sort of $100 million revenue category. And our pipeline also includes larger deals. Deals that are up in the $500 million kind of range in terms of sales. As you know and what I've said many times, we are not looking to do a merger of equals. So we're not looking at companies that are sort of multi-billion dollars in size. But we've got a good range of deals. There are actionable deals and you never can tell when a deal is going to close or if it's going to close, but we are remaining very, very active, and it's a top priority of our management team to focus on deals and bring them home.
Christopher Glynn: Okay and then a bit of a bookkeeping question. Given the magnitude of FX changes that was seen is there a rule of thumb how translation impacts incremental margins in overall dropthrough to the bottom line?
Frank Hermance: No we really don't have the kind of rule of thumb. But I can tell you to give you a flavor of that, if we looked at 2015, we looked at currency rates that are pretty close to where they are today, and the impact was about 2% on the top line maybe a little bit greater than 2% on the top line. And on the bottom line it was about $0.05 per share. So that sort of gives you a calibration point, and we have included that in our estimates so that we are assuming that kind of currency impact. We're relatively balanced in terms of cost and sales in currencies so that the impact on us is there. Wish it weren't, but it's not all that sizable.
Christopher Glynn: So just to be clear, your guidance isn't tethered to like a 12/31/2014 exchange rates?
Frank Hermance: No it isn't that close. It's probably the average over the last 4 to 8 weeks. Something like that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Scott Graham: Hey. Good morning, everybody.
Frank Hermance: Hello, Scott.
Dave Zapico: Hello, Scott.
Scott Graham: I'm going to, of course, Frank, ask you to unbundle the business units if you don't mind. But I had a couple of – for the organic growth that is – I had a couple of other housekeepers I wanted to maybe piggyback on Chris's question. What was the impact of FX EPS-wise in the quarter?
Frank Hermance: Virtually nothing. Virtually nothing on the bottom line in terms of EPS.
Scott Graham: Right. What are the Company realize in pricing for the fourth quarter?
Frank Hermance: Another good question. We're up about 1.6% in pricing. Just to follow on the inflation was about 0.8%. So the net of those 2 was about 0.8% to the bottom line.
Scott Graham: And that's exactly where this question was going. Do you expect to be sort of price-cost positive in 2015?
Frank Hermance: Absolutely, Scott. We focus on that ratio like a hawk is probably the best way to describe it. And our estimates – and it's somewhat difficult to estimate exactly, but our estimates right now are between 1.5% and 2% on pricing, and inflation running a little bit higher this year. Probably closer to 0.8%, 0.9%, 1%, something in that region. So that's essentially what's baked into our budget.
Scott Graham: And my last question, again before you unbundle things for us, Frank, again if you would. The productivity number as expected, as I expected at least, $100 million-plus. Typically however you get there without the need for any realignment, because you kind of take your second and third pass through acquisitions and what have you. I guess my question is, is there upside to that $110 million for 2015?
Frank Hermance: Absolutely. It's a conservative number. You know our history, Scott. We typically come out with a number and then as our operating units perform and we have confidence that they're going to do more, we will raise that as the year goes on. So I personally would be disappointed if we didn't end up well above that $110 million number. But we'll update you in each quarter.
Scott Graham: That would be great. Thank you.
Frank Hermance: I will give you an update on the various businesses as Scott asked. I'll start with EIG. EIG aerospace had really a super fourth quarter with organic sales and orders both up low double digits reflecting excellent growth in our regional and business-to-business and a continued strong growth in our commercial aerospace business. As we look ahead to 2015, we expect EIG aerospace sales to be up in the mid-single-digit region, and that's going to be driven by the continued ramp up of our key commercial OEM platforms and solid growth in business and regional jets. Our process businesses had a solid fourth quarter to complete really an excellent year. In the fourth quarter overall sales were up low double digits on a percentage basis. Organic sales were flat, but it was against a very difficult comparison from the prior year. Overall growth was driven by contributions from the recent acquisitions which were Creaform, VTI instruments, Luphos, Zygo, and AMPTEK. We are already seeing the benefits, as I mentioned in my opening talk, from the AMPTEK acquisition with the introduction of a new product at EDAX using AMPTEK's detector technology. Also, the introduction of a number of new products at Creaform has been very well received by their customers. So in mid-2015, we're optimistic. We expect our process businesses to grow mid- to high-single digits overall with mid-single digit organic growth. And the third part of EIG is power and industrial. Power and industrial businesses had a strong fourth quarter. Overall sales were up approximately 24% with the growth driven by the contributions from Teseq and Powervar. These 2 acquisitions that we did recently, and we're very pleased with the success of those acquisitions both of those businesses are performing quite well and are actually exceeding the models we put in place for them. And for 2015, we expect both overall and organic sales for power and industrial to be up low- to mid-single digits. So if you sum those 3 parts of EIG, for all of EIG for 2015, we're expecting overall sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis with organic growth up low- to mid-single digits. Moving on to EMG. Our differentiated businesses had a great fourth quarter with strong sales and order performance. Sales were up mid-single digits driven by strong growth in our precision motion control and our engineered materials interconnect and packaging businesses. Orders were really strong. They were up 10% organically. For 2015, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up mid-single digits overall and organically. And the last part of the Company, our floor care and specialty motors business. The sales in that business were down mid-single digits organically in the quarter, and that was against a very difficult comparison from the prior-year, and for 2015, we expect sales for this business to be up low-single digits organically. And if you sum those 2 parts of EMG, for all of EMG, we expect both overall an organic growth of low- to mid-single digits on a percentage basis. And that's how we then roll up the Company so that as a whole we are expecting mid-single digit sales growth overall with organic growth up in this low- to mid-single digit region.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Radigan with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Joseph Radigan: Hey. Good morning, guys. 
Frank Hermance: Hey. 
Joseph Radigan: Frank, on the cost reduction targets, last year you came in expecting 90 cost savings 60 sourcing, obviously you did better than that as you do every year. Can you maybe just explain the process you go through to identify that number going into a year and then how you flex it up as necessary? I'm sure it's not just an arbitrary number out there, but maybe give a little bit more granular detail on how you derive that number?
Frank Hermance: There's chuckling going on in the room, because it's really not arbitrary. We do a very extensive process as we go through the budgets for 2015. And for every one of our operations, we ask them to identify growth projects in terms of how they're going to grow the top line. We ask them to look at pricing. We look very intently at inflation, and then we look at cost improvements that they need to put in the business so that they get a good return for shareholders. It's a very detailed analysis in each of those parts of the business. So every business has a cost improvement target that they are not only focused on, but there is also an element of their compensation which is related to it. And what Bob does is rolls that up from throughout the entire Company, and that provides a number to us and quite frankly we gave that a bit of a haircut, because not every business unit is going to make their exact target as some are going to over perform some are going to under perform. And therefore when we first come out and talk with you, we give you a conservative number, and then as we go through the year, we will look to see how the overall Company is doing, and we tend to raise it. And there will also be dynamics in businesses where they'll get into the year, and they'll say – some businesses will say, the year looks a little tougher and we're going to do a little bit more in this area. And then there number goes up. So it's a flexible type thing. We look at it very closely and it's not just a swag. It's analytically driven.
Joseph Radigan: On the revenue side, book-to-bill has been below one for the last couple of quarters. I know you guys, a lot of your businesses are long cycle so orders can be lumpy. You can't really look at it necessarily on a quarterly basis, but in this kind of choppy organic growth environment, are there any growth accelerators that are within your control. I mean you're calling for low- to mid-single digit organic growth. How much of that do you think is within your control in this sort of environment?
Frank Hermance: I think a fair amount of it is in our control. We are putting hefty investments in RD&E that we talked about. And obviously they're going to have an impact on the organic growth. And the products that come out and are produced the better they are the more market penetration we're going to get. We're going to continue the investments in international regions. You heard some of the data that I provided with the strong growth that we are seeing in international. So we're going to continue to put those investments in and focus on the distribution system both outside the US and inside the US. And actually that book-to-bill that you're talking about it was 0.99 in the fourth quarter, but actually it was driven by the FX effect on backlog. So if you take that out the book-to-bill was actually pretty much in line. So it's hard, as you mentioned, with the type of businesses we have to focus on that backlog number. But we feel pretty good about it. It's $1.2 billion. It's up a nice amount from the end of the previous year so – and very importantly, the organic growth in orders in Q4 was very strong as I mentioned in my opening remarks. It was up 7% so a very very good number. Actually the organic growth in orders for all of 2014 was up 4%, a fairly healthy number in this environment.
Joseph Radigan: Last one on the aerospace side. You talked about what you're seeing in EIG. Can you maybe talk about what you saw on the EMG side the third-party MRO and the military and what your expectations are for 2015 there?
Frank Hermance: Okay I'll take that. If you look at the MRO business, those markets for 2015 are going up 3% to 4%. That's the general market growth. We're calling for mid-single digits in that part of the business so we expect it to be reasonably good. The surprise is military. We all expected that military was going to be a real drag on the business. And in fact, in the fourth quarter our military business was up mid-single digits, and we really scrubbed this number, but for 2015, we're expecting it to be up mid-single digits as well. That's being driven by a couple of things. It's not as much driven by the US military market as it is the international business. We've got a good amount of content in military in Europe, and that business is doing quite well. So there's a fair amount of confidence. And actually when you look across all of aerospace for the Company for next year, we're looking at mid-single digit growth in essentially all the parts of aerospace. It might end up a little bit stronger in commercial than what we're calling for right now, because obviously there's some key drivers going on there with new platforms, but overall aerospace is a good picture for us right now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.
Brian Konigsberg: Yes. Hi. Good morning.
Dave Zapico: Hi. 
Frank Hermance: Hi.
Brian Konigsberg: Hey. Just a quick question, and I apologize if you discuss this already. The other income line you had a positive impact in the quarter. Typically that has seen some costs accrue into that line. Can you just spell out what that is and what – is there any assumptions in 2015 that we should be aware of?
Bob Mandos: This is Bob. The answer to the question there is we had a settlement to the gain on some old insurance policies that relate to environmental policies that actually just benefit from in the fourth quarter and that's really what's lowing through.
Frank Hermance: If I could just add to what Bob said. If you look below the operating income line, obviously we picked up a benefit there that was offset to some degree by the increase in interest expense that was due to the private placement we did, so we picked up sort of a penny below the line. But as we mentioned several times during the call, we actually took a couple of cents of realignment costs above the line and as a result, our earnings were really a very high quality, so we felt very good about that.
Brian Konigsberg: And then your interest expense for 2015. You expect that to be mid-80s?
Bob Mandos: We expect that it's going to be an incremental increase of about $0.03 per share as we go into 2015.
Brian Konigsberg: Nothing in the other line?
Bob Mandos: No, I think the other line will kind of normalize as we expect 2015 to progress.
Brian Konigsberg: Understood. And then just one other question. The guidance on the process of business. You kind of spelled out for kind of I guess gave us a more detail on the exposures to up mid-and down. You are seeing the main exposure on the upstream was $125 million. You're saying – I think you're saying there's about a $40 million sales impact expected in 2015 which would expect a 10% drop. I guess if you just layer that in, and I think that's about 25% of the process business, it suggests the remainder of the business are expected to do really, really well.
Frank Hermance: Yes, absolutely.
Brian Konigsberg: Maybe can you just give a little – is that really – is that how we should be looking at it?
Frank Hermance: Yes, I'll let Dave take that question.
Dave Zapico: The ultra precision technology business and the materials analysis division are now much bigger parts of the process, and they are tied to the general industrial market and the research market that's about 80% of the process business now. And those businesses are going very well. We are seeing organic growth related to new product introduction and global expansion. Those 2 businesses while the oil and gas business was growing very nicely through our acquisition strategy have become a much bigger part of process and that's where the growth is coming from.
Brian Konigsberg: And then just mid and downstream. So you don't anticipate any impact those markets at all. We have started to see some cracks in a couple of downstream projects a couple refineries were canceled or pushed out last week. We saw a gas to liquids project pushed out. What is your expectation? Is that holding it firm in 2015, or are you baking in some potential weakness in numbers?
Dave Zapico: We are baking in some potential weakness. It's not nearly like the upstream, but we are baking in some weakness. Basically we are balanced geographically in that part of the business, and we are seeing the larger international projects moving along. There is a big aftermarket component in that part of the business. About a quarter to a third of the business is aftermarket, and there's some demand drivers and environmental regulations that are impacting the business positively. So we see a slight decline but nothing like the upstream, and that's all factored into that $40 million.
Operator: Mr. Coleman, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.

Frank S. Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an excellent third quarter, driven by strong execution of our Four Growth Strategies. We established records for sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share in the quarter. As expected, Zygo integration costs incurred in the quarter were $13.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share. All financial results and commentary on the call today will be on an adjusted basis, excluding these integration costs. Now on to the third quarter results. Sales in the quarter were very strong, up 16% to $1.03 billion. Organic sales increased 3.5%, in line with our expectations, while acquisitions added 12.5% and currency was flat. Operating income for the third quarter was also very strong, up 13% to $231.8 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was 22.5% compared to 23% in the third quarter of 2013. Excluding the dilutive impact on operating margins of recent acquisitions, AMETEK's operating margins in the quarter were 23.4%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Net income and diluted earnings per share were both up 19% over last year's third quarter to $152.5 million and $0.62, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were above the high end of our guidance range. Orders in the third quarter were $1 billion, up 6% from the prior year with 3% organic growth. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was excellent, up 18% to $197 million. Operating working capital was also very strong at 17.8% of sales, down from last year's third quarter of 18.2%. Turning our attention now to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a great quarter. Sales were up 26% to $631.6 million on broad-based strength across our Aerospace, Process and Power & Industrial businesses plus the contributions from the recent acquisitions. Organic sales were up 4%, acquisitions added 22% and foreign currency was flat during the quarter. EIG's operating income increased 17% to $162 million, and operating margins were 25.6%. Excluding the dilutive impact on operating margins of recent acquisitions, EIG's operating margins were 28%, up 10 basis points from last year's third quarter. The Electromechanical Group also had a very strong quarter with excellent operating performance. Sales were up 3% to $400.2 million, organic sales were up 2% and foreign currency added 1%. Growth was driven by strength in our Precision Motion Control and Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $82 million, and operating margins were 20.5%, up 60 basis points from last year's third quarter. Now turning to our Four Growth Strategies of Operational Excellence, Global and Market Expansion, New Product Development and Strategic Acquisitions. First, I will touch on New Product Development. We continue to increase our investment in RD&E to ensure our businesses are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2014, we expect to spend approximately $210 million, a 17% increase over 2013. Our CAMECA business continues to develop highly advanced elemental and isotopic microanalysis instrumentation for the high-end materials analysis markets. In the third quarter, they launched their latest generation in tomographic atom probes, the CAMECA Leap 5000. The Leap 5000 is the only materials analysis technology currently available that offers both 3D characterization and chemical composition analysis at the atomic scale. Improving on previous technology, the Leap 5000 has increased detection efficiency across a number of metals, semiconductors and insulators, delivering improved compositional analysis and detection limits. Our Taylor Hobson business, a leading provider of surface and form metrology instrument utilizing both contact and noncontact solutions, continues to expand our ultraprecision metrology product offering with the introduction of the Talyrond 500H. This new product is a highly advanced metrology instrument used to analyze surface finish, roundness and contour for use in a wide range of high-volume precision manufacturing applications. The Talyrond 500, offering industry-leading speed, accuracy and repeatability, uses rotary, vertical and horizontal measuring axes to duplicate a machine tool's environment and exactly reproduce the workpiece shape, enabling precise control of manufacturing processes. Lastly, AMETEK's Chandler Engineering business, which provides testing instrumentation for the upstream oil and gas market, has launched the Model 3300 In-Line Viscometer. This viscometer is used for real-time on-site viscosity measurements of fracturing fluids, an increasingly important measurement driving improved efficiency in the completion of oil and gas wells. The Model 3300 is ruggedized to withstand harsh field conditions while providing operators with continuous, real-time measurements of the viscosity and temperature of fracturing fluids. We are seeing strong demand for this new viscometer. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 23% of sales in the third quarter, up from 21% in last year's third quarter. Now turning to our second strategy of Global and Market Expansion. Global and Market Expansion continues to be important driver for AMETEK's long-term growth as we are increasingly expanding our presence in attractive, higher-growth market segments and geographic regions. In the third quarter of 2014, international sales represented 53% of our total sales. We saw solid growth in the BRIC countries in the third quarter with continued strong growth in China, where organic sales grew mid-teens on a percentage basis. The growth in China was broad based across our businesses and reflects the benefits of our continued focus on expanding our sales, service and distribution capabilities in this region. We will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive long-term global growth opportunities. Now turning to our third strategy of acquisitions. We continue to see great success with our acquisition strategy. Thus far in 2014, we have completed 5 acquisitions, deploying approximately $570 million -- $575 million in capital and acquiring over $285 million in revenue. Over the last 15 months, we've acquired 8 businesses, deployed approximately $1 billion in capital and acquired approximately $460 million in revenue. Our acquisition pipeline remains strong, and I expect you're going to hear from us hopefully before year end. I will provide some background on our most recent acquisition, AMPTEK, which we completed in the third quarter. AMPTEK is a privately held manufacturer of instrumentation and detectors used to identify composition of materials using x-ray fluorescence. Its products are sold to OEMs that manufacture nondestructive testing devices to measure elemental composition in metal production, pharmaceutical products, electronics and environmental samples. AMPTEK is an excellent strategic acquisition as it provides us with attractive sensor and detector technology as well as strong research and development capabilities, which will help to accelerate future technology developments for our served market. They're headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts and has annual sales of approximately $30 million. We're quite pleased with the pace of our acquisition activity over the last 15 months. More importantly, we're excited about the quality of the businesses we acquired during that time and the great strategic fit of these businesses within AMETEK. The integration of these recent acquisitions has gone very well. We'll continue to capitalize on our strong core competency of acquiring and integrating high-quality businesses while looking to expand our presence in attractive market segments. Lastly, I will touch on Operational Excellence. We continue to see excellent results from our various Operational Excellence initiatives. Our management teams and employees continue to do a great job driving operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the numerous Operational Excellence tools we have in place throughout the company. Operational Excellence activities include Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factory and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our New Product Development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, movement of production to low-cost locales and value engineering. Through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, we recognized $19 million in savings in the third quarter and have recognized approximately $53 million in incremental savings thus far in 2014. As a result of the continued strong efforts of our team, we expect approximately $100 million in total cost savings in 2014 through our various Operational Excellence initiatives, including $70 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. This is an increase in total cost savings from our prior estimate of $95 million. Turning now to the outlook for the remainder of 2014. The global growth environment remains sluggish. For all of 2014, we continue to expect revenue to be up low double digits on a percentage basis from 2013, reflecting low- to mid-single-digit organic growth and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Earnings for 2014 are expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.42 per diluted share, up 14% to 15% over 2013. We raised the low end of our previous guidance from $2.37 to $2.40 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2014 sales are expected to be up high single digits on a percentage basis from last year's fourth quarter with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.60 to $0.62 per diluted share, including the additional interest expense associated with our recent private placement and expected foreign currency headwinds. This guidance represents a 9% to 13% increase over last year's fourth quarter. So in summary, we delivered excellent results in the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our excellent portfolio of businesses and our focus on driving success through our Four Growth Strategies should enable us to continue to deliver strong and consistent earnings growth. Bob Mandos will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be happy to answer your questions. Bob?
Robert R. Mandos: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a great third quarter with strong overall results. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, core growth in selling expenses was in line with core growth in sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales versus 1.3% of sales in last year's third quarter. In the quarter, as was contemplated in our guidance, were onetime events benefiting the tax line, which were largely offset by a related negative impact in other expense. For 2014, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 28% as a result of our ongoing international and state tax planning initiatives and the third quarter tax benefit, as just highlighted. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, be it positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory plus payables, was 17.8% of sales in the quarter versus 18.2% in last year's third quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $18 million for the quarter. Full year 2014 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $37 million for the quarter. 2014 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $142 million. Operating cash flow was $197 million in the third quarter, up 18% over last year's third quarter. The free cash flow was $179 million in the quarter or 126% of net income, up 19% over last year's third quarter. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 110% of net income. Total debt was $1.64 billion at September 30, up $222 million from the 2013 year-end, largely the result of the Zygo acquisition. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $370 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at September 30 of 26.8%. At September 30, we had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. This amount reflects the private placement agreement we entered into on September 30 to sell $700 million of senior notes. The initial private placement funding of $500 million received on September 30 was used to pay down our revolver balance. The remaining funding of $200 million will be received in 2015 with the proceeds expected to be used to pay down term debt due at that time. The private placement had a weighted average interest rate of 3.88% and was well received by our lenders. It provides AMETEK with a larger financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. In summary, we had a very strong third quarter. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.
Kevin C. Coleman: Great. Thank you, Bob. Suzy, we're now happy to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Frank, just given the changing dynamics in crude prices here, could you maybe walk us through how we should think about your energy-related businesses in this kind of environment?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure, Allison. Obviously, the price of crude has come down. Yesterday, it dipped for a while even below $80 a barrel but did end up above $80 a barrel. If there's going to be any impact, and I must say we have not seen any as of yet, do we -- I have talked to all of our energy-related businesses, and they have not seen anything yet in terms of any impact. I think one way to look at the possible impact is to look at our upstream business. Our upstream business is about $125 million of sales. So if less oil wells are going to be drilled, we could see some impact on that segment. But I think the very encouraging thing here, and you've heard me talk to this over the last several quarters, is that there has been a rebalance in terms of our Process businesses in general, where, as a result of recent acquisitions as well as just the fact that the Oil & Gas business is a small part of the Process businesses, our unrelated Oil & Gas businesses have been doing extremely well this year. And if we go back to like last year, our Oil & Gas businesses were sort of a driver for the Process growth. And as we enter this year, that was no longer true, actually, even before this drop in oil prices. And there's been a sort of a rebalance, and we're getting extremely good growth out of our Ultra Precision Technologies business, our Materials Analysis business and our Measurement & Calibration Technologies business, which has rebalanced the Process area so that our growth remained good in the third quarter. It was up organically mid-single digits. And also, with the acquisitions we've done, it was up actually 25% in the quarter. So there could be some impact, but we don't believe it's going to be significant in terms of AMETEK's overall performance.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's great. And then just turning to the vitality index that you talked about with New Products. It's certainly been ticking up, which one would expect with your RD&E expense. But is there any way, I don't even know, to look at it, sort of acquisitions, what you've done recently? Is that causing that number to tick up maybe a little bit more than we would have expected on an organic basis?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I think that's a good analysis, Allison. There's no question that the acquisitions that we have done over the last couple of years are much more technology focused, and they are basically winning in the market based on technology. And their investment levels are a bit higher than what AMETEK has historically been, which is really inherent in our strategy to keep moving the level of differentiation of our businesses at sort of up that differentiation curve. And as a result, this vitality index continues to creep up. And 23% is a pretty high number for any sort of industrial -- multi-industry company. It's obviously low with respect to full technology companies like sort of on the West Coast. But in terms of our type of company, it's a very, very good number. We're going to continue to invest. We think it's the key reason why our profit margins are where they are.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Bob, housekeeping on payables.
Robert R. Mandos: Yes,$382 million.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: $382 million. Okay. And Frank, you said orders were up 3% organically?
Frank S. Hermance: That's correct.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. What was your backlog?
Frank S. Hermance: Backlog was $1.22 billion, and that was up about $75 million from the beginning of the year.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Can you go through your walk on the different businesses in the quarter and what you're expecting in 2014?
Frank S. Hermance: Sure. Sure, I'd be glad to, Mark. So let's start with EIG, and I'll start with EIG Aerospace. They had another really good quarter. Sales were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, and that was driven by continued strength in both commercial aerospace and our business -- and regional jet business. The business and regional jet business benefited significantly from excellent growth in the mid- and high-end business jet as well as the commercial helicopter markets. We have helicopter sales in that business and regional jet sort of segmentation. We expect continued strong performance in EIG Aerospace in the fourth quarter. And for all of 2014, Aerospace in EIG should be up mid-single digits. Moving to Process, our Process businesses had an excellent quarter. As I mentioned in response to Allison's question, overall sales were up about 25%. Organic sales were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, driven by strong performance in Ultra Precision Technologies, Measurement & Calibration Technologies and our Materials Analysis businesses. The overall growth benefited from the 6 recent acquisitions in this business, which are AMPTEK, Zygo, Luphos, VTI Instruments, Creaform and Controls Southeast. And for the full year, we expect our Process businesses to grow mid-teens overall with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. And the last part of EIG, our Power & Industrial businesses, had really a great quarter. Overall sales were up 40% as a result of mid-single-digit organic growth and the contributions from the acquisitions of Powervar and Teseq. Organic growth was strong of both -- across both the Power and the Industrial businesses. We're expecting overall sales for Power & Industrial to be up about 30% in 2014 with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. So if you take those 3 sub-segments in EIG, for all of EIG we expect overall 2014 sales to be up high teens on a percentage basis with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. Moving to the other part of the company. In EMG, our differentiated EMG businesses had a very good quarter, sales up mid-single digits on a percentage basis. We saw strong growth in our Precision Motion Control and Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses. And for all of 2014, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up low to mid-single digits. And the last part of our company, which is Floorcare & Specialty Motors, sales in our Floorcare & Specialty Motors businesses were down mid-single digits in the quarter against a pretty difficult comparison from the prior year. And for all of 2014, we expect sales for this business to be roughly flat. And if you saw in those 2 parts of EMG, for all of EMG we're expecting overall growth to be low to mid-single digits in 2014. And thus, if you take EIG and EMG, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, for AMETEK as a whole in 2014, we're expecting this low double-digit sales growth with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. And that walks you through, Mark.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So I was wondering what the fourth quarter impact of the private placement interest was versus what you kind of had in your guidance before. That would be helpful.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, there's 2 things that were -- affected our estimates in the fourth quarter. One was the private placement, and that was about a $0.01. And the other was foreign exchange because as you know, the foreign exchange rates have moved quite considerably. And using the September 30 rates on foreign exchange, we basically have another $0.01 of hurt in the quarter. So if you take those $0.02, which we -- really, we're not counting on having those issues, but we were able to overcome them with both -- some sales performance improvements as well as improvements on the Operational Excellence side. If you'll notice, we raised our guidance in terms of the amount of cost savings we're putting through the P&L from that $95 million up to the $100 million level. If it weren't for those 2 items, we would have been able to increase our guidance.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Yes, got it. My follow-up question is you're kind of signaling that you're close to the alter on something again potentially for the fourth quarter. I was just wondering, Frank, if there's any possibility of getting a little bit more color on that, like which division you're looking at to add to. And if at all possible, is this sort of AMPTEK size? Is it Zygo size? Is it something in between?
Frank S. Hermance: Well, we're looking actually at a couple of different possibilities right now. And we are in active conversations and I think within the next day, we'll be in active due diligence on another -- of business. I'm hesitant to give too much color on it, but I can tell you that both of these businesses do happen to be on the EIG side of the business. And they're both really, really good businesses, and -- but I'm -- I just don't want to give any more color on these because obviously, we're under confidentiality agreements in terms of these 2 deals. I think that really, the key message here also is that acquisitions are really a process at AMETEK and that we are just continually doing this. And where other companies have been having difficulties over the course of the last probably 2 years, I think you'll notice or Ken noticed that we have been able to do a large number of deals and buy them at reasonable multiples even though we all know the pricing of deals has gone up. And I think it really reflects the fact that we have a very, very solid process that we're continually looking at deals, continually filtering deals. And whether we close a deal in the fourth quarter, we may or we may not if something doesn't go as we expect. But the point is if we don't, we'll close something else in the first quarter. So it's just a continual effort, and we're just going to keep doing this. We think it's the best way to deploy capital and get a return on that capital. That will continue to push our stock price in a positive direction.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question coming from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And could you just talk through a minute or 2 about geographic growth? I mean, you really flagged some impressive growth out of China. How did the other regions look on a core basis, U.S., Europe, against that 3.5% core growth rate?
Frank S. Hermance: Sure, Richard. If you look around the world, the U.S. was up about 5%, Europe was up about 1% and Asia was up about 5%. If you look outside of China -- china was actually up 17% organically. And if you look outside of China in both Korea and Japan, we had some very difficult comparisons to last quarter. So that's why that Asia growth is maybe a little bit lower than what you would expect given our China performance. The U.S. continues to get a bit better, and -- which is good. I believe that's the highest organic growth we've had in the U.S. in a while. And Europe is a little bit weaker, and I think it generally reflects the economic situation that is going on in Europe.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And does the Asian business in general and China in particular, does AMETEK lead there with their EIG business?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I would say the EIG businesses are definitely the leader. We have done a tremendous amount, and the team has really done some good work in continuing to expand our distribution channels there for the EIG businesses. But I must say that our EMG businesses are also starting to penetrate quite significantly. Obviously, our Floorcare business has been there for a long time, and we are manufacturing products there for the Floorcare business. But also, our Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging businesses has a plant in Malaysia, and they are starting to have really good penetration in Asia. And also, our Precision Motion Control business, both through the acquisition of Dunker in Germany, which have substantial sales in Europe, as well as our original PMC business, which was predominantly U.S.-based, has expanded quite well. So I think your comment is right that the leadership and the penetration came and is coming from EIG, but EMG is also starting to realize really good opportunities there. And as we look across the regions, even though there's been a lot in the press about slowing organic growth in Asia, those numbers are still a lot higher than anyplace else in the world. And therefore, we're going to continue to invest and continue to get our fair share of the business there.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Frank, when you look at the business today, and obviously kind of the intermediate-term kind of business environment is just very hazy. I mean, we've got this oil and gas noise out there. I noticed your EMIP business has perked up, which might be more of a later-cycle business. But how do you just get your arms around business conditions globally here? I mean, do you feel we're kind of in this mid-cycle malaise a little bit? Or how do you -- are any of your businesses kind of picking up?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, it's a great question, Richard. And I think the best way to characterize it is if I look at the total global environment right now, I wouldn't use the word hazy because I think when we went back in time, some of the downturns were what I would call hazy. Here, I think we know what is occurring. We know the U.S. is getting better. We know there's substantial opportunities in the Far East, which we're capitalizing on. We know Europe is a bit weaker. So we're just going to capitalize on what we see in terms of that market and where -- markets -- and where we're investing. So we're going to put more investment in the Far East, we're going to put more investment in the U.S. and we're not going to put quite as much in Europe. And yes, your question regarding specific businesses, we have just tremendous balance in our businesses. And I think it's one of the advantages that AMETEK has had for many, many years in that we're not really tied to any one segment significantly. And therefore, when oil and gas starts to shake a little bit, yes, that could have maybe a bit of a negative impact. But heck, Aerospace is doing just great. When you've got this huge backlog at Boeing and Airbus, 8-year backlogs, we're doing tremendously well in the business in regional jet sector, and that sector really hasn't even come back from a market viewpoint. So that's one that we are starting to see accelerated growth and have actually seen accelerated growth through our New Product Development activities. And we expect the market is going to start to turn up, and you're feeling some of that now. Some of the reports in this quarter from some of the business jet manufacturers are starting to see some -- production go up. And it's not going to be at the levels, say, of 2007 in the near term, but the growth rates are really good. So that's the part of our business that I feel very, very good about. And yes, to your point, Engineered Materials, Interconnects and Packaging business is definitely in a rebound mode. Our Precision Motion Control business is doing extremely well and they're growing at a nice clip. So I'm not sitting here in what I call a hazy environment. I wish the growth worldwide was about 4 or 5 points higher, but you sort of deal with it and it also plays to our strength on the Operational Excellence side. When you don't have the 7% and 8% and 9% organic growth, you've got to get the earnings through Operational Excellence. And we're pretty good at that and we're just going to continue to make continued improvements in terms of the efficiency of the business.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And the environment seems to be strong enough here. Are you still generating kind of the 1.5 points to 2 points of price underneath?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. Yes.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, so that's still there as well.

Frank Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. AMETEK had an excellent second quarter with very strong execution of our four growth strategies. In the quarter, we established records for all key financial metrics including orders, sales, operating income, operating margins, net income and diluted EPS. Additionally, we ended the second quarter with a record backlog of $1.25 billion. We remained very active on the acquisition front. During the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of Zygo Corporation and acquired Luphos, a technology acquisition which is highly synergistic with Zygo and our Taylor Hobson and metrology businesses. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired Amptek, a provider of instrumentation used to identify composition of materials used in x-ray fluorescence. I will provide more details on our continued strong acquisition activity in a moment, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 13% to $990.7 million, organic sales increased 4%, while acquisitions added 8% and currency added 1%. Operating income for the second quarter was very strong. It increased 14% to $231.7 million from $202.6 million last year. Operating income margin in the quarter was a record 23.4%, a 30 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2013. Net income and diluted earnings per share were both up 17% over last year’s second quarter to 150.1 cents and $0.61 respectively. Our diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. Orders in the second quarter were very strong at $1.1 billion, up 21% overall from the prior year driven by solid organic growth and the contributions from recent acquisitions. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.09. Operating cash flow was $155 million for the second quarter up 21% from last years’ first quarter – second quarter, excuse me and operating working capital was excellent at 17.7% of sales. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The electronic instruments had an excellent quarter. Sales were up 19% to $573.3 million on strength and our ultra precision technologies and material analysis businesses plus the contributions from the acquisitions of Controls Southeast, Creaform, Powervar, Teseq, and VTI. Organic sales were up 4%, acquisition s added 14% and foreign currency was a 1% tailwind. EIG's operating income increased 17% to $151.5 million, and operating margins were 26.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact on operating margins of recent acquisitions, EIG's operating margins were 27.6%, up 80 basis points from last year's second quarter. The Electromechanical Group had a great quarter as well with strong operating performance. Sales were up 6% to $417.4 million. Organic sales were up 4%, and foreign currency added 2%. Growth was broad-based with particular strength in our precision motion control and engineered materials interconnect and packaging businesses. EMG's operating income increased 10% to $92.1 million, and operating margins were superb at 22.1% up 100 basis from last year’s second quarter at a record level. Now turning to our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development, and strategic acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. We continue to remain very active as evidenced by our record M&A activity over the past 12 months. With the Zygo, Luphos and Amptek acquisitions, we have now acquired eight businesses over the last 12 months, deployed nearly $1 billion in capital, and acquired approximately $460 million in revenue. Thus far in 2014, we have deployed approximately $570 million in capital and acquired over $285 million in sales on five acquisitions. Importantly, our acquisition pipeline remains very strong. Now let me provide some highlights on the three recent acquisitions. We completed the acquisition of Zygo on June 20th. Total capital deployed on the acquisition was approximately $280 million net of cash acquired. Zygo has annual sales of approximately $165 million. Zygo is truly a great strategic fit with AMETEK. We are very excited about this acquisition and are pleased to welcome the Zygo team to AMETEK. Zygo is a leading provider of non-contact metrology solutions, high precision optics and optical assemblies for use in semiconductor, medical, life sciences, industrial, and aerospace and defense end-markets. They have a high value, differentiated technology capability, along with a strong brand within the optical and metrology markets. Zygo’s leading position in non-contract optical metrology directly complements our strength in contract metrology, expanding our capabilities in this very attractive market. As previously indicated, we expect sizable synergy through elimination of public company, costs, sourcing savings, and through leveraging our global infrastructure. Also in the second quarter, we acquired Luphos, a small, yet highly strategic technology acquisition. Luphos provides us with exciting technology which is highly complementary to our existing metrology technology. Luphos’s core technology is used in the measure of complex aspheric optical surfaces through non-contract methods. Our Taylor Hobson metrology business provides similar measurement capabilities through contact metrology technology. So this way, we really have both technology capabilities either non-contact or contact metrology capabilities. The addition of Luphos expands our metrology capabilities across a broader range of surface finishes and profiles, thereby providing our customers a broader product portfolios to serve their various applications and they are headquartered outside of Frankfurt, Germany. Lastly, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Amptek. Amptek is a privately held manufacturer of instrumentation and detectors used to identify the composition of materials using x-ray fluorescence. Amptek’s products are sold to OEMs that manufacture non-destructive testing devices to measure element of composition in metal production, pharmaceutical products, electronics and environmental samples. Amptek is another excellent strategic acquisition for us as it provides us with attractive sensor and detector technology as well as strong R&D developments capabilities which will help to accelerate future technology developments for our served markets. In addition, Amptek Detector Technology opens up new market and application opportunities in bench top and life sciences applications. They are headquartered in Bedford Mass and have annual sales of approximately $30 million and they are a very, very profitable company. Now, turning to global and market expansion. Global and market expansion continues to be a key driver for our growth as we are increasingly expanding our presence in attractive higher growth market segments and geographic regions. In the second quarter of 2014, international sales represented 56% of our total sales, and this was up from 54% of sales in the second quarter of 2013. The increase in international sales percentage was driven by strong organic growth in Asia and the benefit from recent acquisitions. Organic sales in Asia were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the second quarter, with broad-based strength across our businesses. This strong growth reflects the benefits of our continued focus on expanding our sales, service and distribution capabilities in this region. We will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities, and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities. Now, turning to new product developments. New product development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long-term health in growth. We have consistently grown our investment in RD&E to ensure we are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2014, we expect to spend approximately $210 million, a 17% increase over 2013. And we are excited about some recent new product introductions. Creaform, which we acquired in 2013, is a leader in portable 3D scanning technology. During the second quarter, Creaform introduced two new portable 3D scanners. The Go!SCAN 3D and the HandySCAN 3D, that represents breakthroughs in terms of speed accuracy and versatility. The Go!SCAN 3D is a white light scanner that offers accurate, high speed scanning of practically any object and it’s suitable for engineering and CAD projects that require full color 3D models or direct scan to print capabilities. The HandySCAN 3D is a metrology grade laser scanner that achieves ground-breaking accuracy resolution in measurement rates, operating 25 times faster than previous versions. This truly a breakthrough kind of product. The HandySCAN 3D is suitable for all stages in the product developments life cycle from design, prototyping, testing, assembly, production and quality control. Both the Go!SCAN 3D and the HandySCAN 3D rely on Creaform’s new VX application software to quickly and seamlessly integrate digital scans into 3D printing or CAD process applications. Creaform is seeing extremely strong growth in 2014 through the success of their new product introductions and their market expansion efforts. AMETEK’s ORTEC product group introduced a number of new products including a new series of high purity germanium detectors, the profile S and C series. These new radiation detector products provide exceptional resolution across the entire energy range while also improving efficiency at the lower energies. Further cementing ORTEC’s leading position and nuclear radiation detection and identification systems. ORTEC also launched their PINS3 Portable Chemical Identification System leveraging our experience with radiation detection, this new product safely and quickly identifies hazardous chemicals inside munitions or chemical storage containers by conducting non-destructive gamma ray analysis. The system is completely portable for liquid nitrogen or shielded radioactive sources. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 22% of sales in the second quarter up from 21% in the last year’s quarter. Lastly, I’ll touch on OpEx, we continue to see tremendous results from our various operational excellence initiatives. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving operational improvements through their businesses, leveraging the numerous operational excellence tools we have in place throughout the company. Key tenets of our operational excellence activities include Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, moving our production to low-cost locales and value engineering. Through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, we recognized $18 million in savings in the second quarter and as a result of the continued strong efforts of our team. We now expect approximately $95 million in total cost savings in 2014 through our operational excellence initiatives including $65 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. This is up from $90 million in total cost that we targeted at the end of the first quarter. Turning to the outlook, for the remainder of 2014, we continue to expect our businesses to show solid growth during 2014 with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We now anticipate 2014 revenue to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis from 2013 reflecting continued solid core growth and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid-single-digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2014 and 2013 excluding one-time Zygo integration costs are expected to be incurred in the third and fourth quarter. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $2.32 to $2.37 and reflects stronger operating performance, plus the benefits from the Zygo acquisition. Third quarter 2014 sales are expected to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from last year's second quarter with organic growth up low to mid single-digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.59 to $0.61 per diluted share, up 13% to 17% over last year's third quarter excluding one-time Zygo integration costs. So in summary, we delivered exceptional performance in the quarter. Our results and increased guidance for 2014 reflect the continued strong execution of our growth strategies. Our balance sheet remains strong and we generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our excellent backlog, strong portfolios of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions, should enable us to perform extremely well for the remainder of 2014. Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bob?
Robert Mandos: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had an excellent second quarter with strong overall results. I will provide some further details. Core growth in selling expenses was in line with core growth in sales in the quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, in line with last year's second quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, versus last year's second quarter rate of 29.4% and in line with our guidance. The lower tax rate in the quarter was a result of our ongoing international tax planning activities. For 2014, we expect our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.7% of sales in the second quarter versus 17.9% in last year’s second quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $15 million for the quarter, for the full year of 2014, capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $33 million for the quarter, full year 2014 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $142 million. Operating cash flow was $155 million in the second quarter, up 21% over last year’s second quarter. Free cash flow was $140 million in the quarter, up 19 over last year’s second quarter.. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 110% of net income. Total debt was $1.6 billion at June 30, up $188 million from the 2013 year end largely the result of the Zygo acquisition. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $283 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at June 30 of 27.8%. At June 30, we had approximately $700 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Zygo Corporation and acquired Luphos bringing our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2014 to approximately $570 million. Also in the second quarter, we announced a 50% increase in it from $0.06 per share. This dividend increase will raise the annualize dividend payout to $0.36 per share. In summary, we had a very strong second quarter, establishing records for essentially all key financial metrics, strong balance sheet and cash flows.
Frank Hermance: Great. Thank you, Bob. Susie, we'll now open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of John Baliotti with Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
John Baliotti – Janney Capital Markets: Thank you. Good morning. Frank, I was wondering, I was kind of looking at, maybe focusing on M&A a little bit. I was just, you continue, cash continues to go up in your balance sheet and you continue to do deals and your working capital as a percent of sales continues to go down or certainly stay in line despite the deals. I was wondering, is there a way to quantify how much of deals that you are doing right now or funded by improvements – and now that the businesses that you have bought, but the businesses that have been core to AMETEK over the years?
Frank Hermance: Yes, I think the best way look at this, John, is that the majority of the savings that we get and the improvements we get are in the existing businesses, but the existing businesses would include what we acquired in the previous year, not what we acquired this year. And we obviously look at both the acquired companies as well as the existing businesses, but because the existing businesses are so much larger in totality, the majority of the improvements come from the existing business – but we are able to offset that with the existing business improvements and sort of the year that we acquire the company. But then in succeeding years we will work very aggressively to improve the working capital of those acquired companies. So, I think the focus and sort of the real answer to your question is that as the existing business is where the majority of this is coming from including the acquisitions from the previous year.
John Baliotti – Janney Capital Markets: Right, and just a follow-on to that, it seems like – and I think in the past you’ve said that, even though you have a rigorous M&A team and a due diligence process, you tend to sort of scatter your deals for lack of a better term in different areas. But it seems like, of the last seven deals, if I have it right about five of them have been more in the metrology, whether it’s contact or non-contact, if you throw to include Creaform in there as complementary to that, I was just wondering, is there – is it greater confidence or interest in that area or is just randomness?
Frank Hermance: It’s more randomness in terms of where the deals come from, John and when you look at where those deals went, although your macro view is absolutely correct that are in these sort of metrology areas. Where they end up in AMETEK is different. For instance, the Amptek acquisition is going to end up in our materials analysis division, where Zygo is ending up in our ultra precision technology division. So, it may seem like, they are all going in the same place, but they are not. We have an internal thought process that we don’t like to do two acquisitions in the same business unit. We might do it in the same division but it would be in different business units just to reduce the risk and only on a few occasions have we not adhered to that.
John Baliotti – Janney Capital Markets: Great, thanks, Frank, and congratulations.
Frank Hermance: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic – Wells Fargo Securities: Hi, good morning guys.
Frank Hermance: Hello, Allison.
Robert Mandos: Hi, Allison.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic – Wells Fargo Securities: I am just sort of riding on that product portfolio question and sort of the ultra precision technology, you’ve done a lot of acquisitions there. Is, outside of sort of organic ideas, is that product portfolio filled out or do you certainly need more immediate end-markets or a different technology there?
Frank Hermance: Yes, we have now done a really superb job of putting key technology into this particular business. So four of the markets that we are focusing on – we now have an excellent portfolio of technologies and we really don’t need additional technologies for that market. However, we can expand the market penetration of UPT and go into other markets and that’s pretty much the strategy that we have used across the company that we get into an area, we fill out the technologies and capabilities for grid access to specific niche markets and then we were on adjacencies that are around that that are really new market segments and we can do that either through acquisition or we can do it through basically internal developments. And I think you may have heard me talk previously about sort of the finger approach which is the way we think about how we bring the deals into AMETEK and every time we do a sizable acquisition it opens up another set of fingers that we can basically add on either additional acquisitions or additional markets through – or internal R&D activities.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic – Wells Fargo Securities: That’s great. Thank you.
Frank Hermance: You bet.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic – Wells Fargo Securities: And then just a lot of moving parts obviously on the EBIT line with the acquisition, so how should be we thinking about that, maybe EIG versus AMG in the back half of the year?
Frank Hermance: Well, as we’ve talked about these – if you look at the margins, the margins in EIG are very, very good. They were at 26.4% in the quarter and EMG is where the margin opportunity is and we continue to do really well on those margins. EMG was a 22.1% if my recollection is correct which was up 100 basis points. So, as we go forward, you are going to see more margin improvement coming out of EMG than EIG and again, through sort of randomness of the acquisitions, a large number of the acquisitions we’ve done in the last say couple of years have ended up in EMG or excuse me, EIG and therefore there tends to be a bit of a dilutive impact on the margins in EIG. We actually consider that positive because what we want to do with those acquired companies is actually buy businesses that have lower margins and make them better. And therefore the return on invested capital turns out to be superb. But we’ve always been able to outgrow that as a company. In other words, our margins are – the 30 basis points we are talking about includes, all of the dilution of the acquisitions and if we extract it out the 30 basis would be up in the 70, 80 basis points area, just to sort of put some numbers on it. So, that’s probably the best way I can answer your question, Allison.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic – Wells Fargo Securities: Great. Thank you so much.
Frank Hermance: You bet.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is coming from line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Morning.
Frank Hermance: Hi, Matt.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: With respect to the core business, Frank, I think you talked about orders been up total 21%. Can you talk about what that looks like organically give the actual number is well if what your sort of core backlog looks like on a year-over-year basis?
Frank Hermance: Yes, I think, I’ll try to do that off the top of my head and Bob, you can correct me if I don’t have exactly the right numbers here. But the organic growth in orders was in the 2%, 3% kind of area. If we look at the backlogs, the backlog was $1.25 billion and the most significant contributor to that was Zygo and Zygo was $83 million. Did I get those numbers right?
Robert Mandos:  You got it.
Frank Hermance: I got them right. Okay.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: And then, with respect to – you’ve obviously done a lot of M&A in the last 12 months and it sounds you are going to exclude the integration costs related to Zygo, but can you quantify the inventory step-up cost, the other acquisition expenses transaction costs that are still flowing through the P&L in aggregate for 2014?
Frank Hermance: Yes, we have not yet finalized exactly what the integration cost of Zygo are going to be going forward and we are in the process of working with the Zygo team to refine that and by the next conference call, I’ll be able to quantify those for you. But they won’t be minor and the reason is, you may recall, Matt, that we are looking for synergy in this deal that is extremely large. And we think there is tremendous synergy between, in particular the Zygo operation or Zygo business and AMETEK. And that’s the reason why we did exclude those costs in our forward-looking guidance and we will get it quantified – I mean, it’s not sort of a material number, it will probably be on the order of $0.04 something like that in that kind of region but it has not been finalized.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: And then, just a follow-up Frank, with respect to all the other deals you’ve done, there is inventory step-up costs, there is transaction costs, what is indeed flowing through the P&L that you are not calling out as one-time?
Frank Hermance: Okay, well, I can give you some numbers for the second quarter. For instance, in the second quarter we had $1.6 million of costs that were used in terms of acquiring Zygo. Okay, and we are sort of separating those costs from going forward integration costs and that $1.6 million was in the P&L and we are just absorbing that. So our earnings would have been – if we excluded that, it would have been $1.6 million higher and it was a very similar number in the first quarter for Zygo. So, just in that six months for one acquisition, we are talking $3.2 million which is basically a penny a share which we have absorbed. And then there are other costs associated with the other deals but they are relatively small in comparison.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great. Thank you, Frank. 
Frank Hermance: You bet, Matt.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: Hey, good morning, Frank, Bob, Kevin.
Frank Hermance: Hi, Scott.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: Just somebody has to ask it, so Frank, hopefully you can go through your by business unit analysis for us, particularly, give us maybe a little bit more color than normal if possible on EMET which is the kind of first time we’ve kind of mentioned that possibly in some time?
Frank Hermance: Yes, now I’d be glad to do that, Scott. Just put a star there. So I’ve got some notes, so I normally do regarding the business sort of sub-segments and I’ll start with EIG. EIG aerospace business really had an excellent quarter, high single-digit organic sales growth and the growth was driven by our business and regional jet business along with continued strength in commercial aerospace. We really expect continued strong performance in this EIG aerospace business throughout 2014 and the trends in OEM build rates for excellent commercial sales, while the continued ramp up that we’ve talked about before Scott, in key business and regional jet platforms, will drive significant demand for us, even though the business and regional jet market has not yet rebounded in a similar or in the way that commercial market has rebounded. So what we are estimating for all of 2014 is that EIG aerospace should be up at least mid single-digits. But process businesses also had a great quarter. Overall sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis and organic sales were up mid single-digits. Overall growth was driven by very good core growth in ultra precision technologies. And material analysis divisions, the two we just talked about a few moments ago, combined with obviously the strong acquisitions we did in this segment which were Control Southeast, Creaform and VTI. For the full year, we expect our process businesses grow mid-teens overall with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. And again, I think it’s going to be pressing more towards the mid than the low. And the last part of EIG is power and industrial sales for that part of the business was up more than 30% in the second quarter and that growth was driven by the contributions from the acquisitions of Powervar and Teseq as well as mid single-digit organic growth. And we expect overall sales for power and industrial to be up approximately 30% in 2014 and organic growth up low to mid single-digits. So, this business is definitely turning upwards now for us which is very, very good. Obviously the aerospace and process businesses have been up and moving higher for a sustained basis, but the power business is now starting to show some strength. So if you sum those three parts of EIG, for all of EIG, we expect 2014 sales to be up high teens on a percentage basis with organic growth up that low to mid single-digits. And moving to the second part of the company, EMG, our differentiated businesses had a very solid quarter with overall sales up mid single-digits organically on a percentage basis. And that strong growth came from our precision motion control and engineered materials interconnect and packaging business. And Scott, you asked me to spend a little bit of time on the engineered material interconnect and packaging businesses, we have been talking about that business turning around, it didn’t turn around quite as quickly as we thought it was going to, but definitely now it has turned the corner. You may remember that part of this business is involved with alloys that are used in titanium production that go into air craft and there was a situation where there was a lot of inventory in the supply chain and we thought this was going to clear but it is now cleared and we are basically seeing the results of that. The other really good thing here is that this team has really embraced our international strategy and have done a lot of work in selling their products now outside the United States. This was a largely US business and it’s rapidly now moving more in line with the rest of the company where a significant part of their business is outside the United States. So you sum it up. We just had that team in here and you can see a smile on their faces which is great. And to finish then with the differentiated businesses, if you sum this up, we are expecting low to mid single-digit organic growth for all of 2014 obviously with a stronger growth in the second part of the year. And, the last part of the company is floor care and specialty motors. Sales in floor care and specialty motors were up low single-digits in the quarter. So continued good performance there and that team expects sales for their business to be up low single digits organically for all of 2014. So, if you look at all of EMG then, and take what I just said for the differentiated businesses as well as the floor care and specialty motors businesses, we expect overall sales growth of low to mid single-digits in 2014. And finally then, if you look at AMETEK as a whole, combining the two segments, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we now expect low double-digit sales growth overall with organic growth up low to mid-single digits and obviously in the second half of the year we are expecting a good organic growth. We had a really fine July on order intake which I think just continues this trend and we are seeing the global autonomy just generally improve, it’s not a dramatic change, but, it sure feels better now than it did six months ago, let’s say. So, Scott, that was a lot, I hope that gives answer to your question.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: Well, it totally does, Frank. Thank you. The answers on that one is always much larger than the question. And I think all of us thank you for always doing that for us. If I could just ask one follow-up just on the M&A very quickly?
Frank Hermance: Sure.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: I think you – something you expressed a quarter or so ago was the desire to really kind of build out your power business and we really haven’t seen other than Powervar the acquisitions there in 2014. How does the pipeline look for that area that I think you are still far getting?
Frank Hermance: No, it looks very good and just to add on, in addition to Powervar, which we did at the end of last year, in the first quarter we acquired Teseq and that’s a power business. So, I am pretty pleased now if you take that whole power business, it has grown to about a $0.5 billion and it also has some diversification within it. There is a roughly $220 million is in power, test and measurement equipment. There is another $200 million that is in battery back-up systems, that’s where Powervar went and there is about $80 million that’s in instrumentation that’s used in generation, transmission and distribution applications. So, for a while, we were not growing the power business. We’ve now done to – we are out of $0.5 billion and that team has there on a $1 billion and that’s the way we are thinking about it. And in terms of the pipeline, yes, there are deals that we are actively looking at in power. So, this is a good to buy because the market is just turning up and hopefully we can close some deals in this space and start to get towards that $1 billion level.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: Frank, you again, thank you. 
Frank Hermance: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mark Douglas with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Douglas – Longbow Research:  Hi, good morning gentlemen.
Frank Hermance: Good morning.
Robert Mandos:  Hi, Mark.
Mark Douglas – Longbow Research: Bob, the payables?
Robert Mandos: $383 million.
Mark Douglas – Longbow Research: $383 million. Thank you. Frank, can you discuss the organic growth by region, maybe expand on the strong growth in Asia, but it sounds like a lot of that is you are just outgrowing the markets there with a lot of new initiatives in sales and marketing I would assume maybe some new products too. But could you just walk through what happened in the different areas?
Frank Hermance: Sure, I am glad to do that. Let’s look organically, organically, in the US, we were up low single-digits and similarly in Europe, we were up low single-digits and as you stated in your question, a significant part of our growth came out of Asia where that growth was up in the mid-teens organically. If you look at the BRIC countries, just another cut, the BRIC countries were up 21% overall and about 13% organically. China, just is superb. China was up organically, almost 25% and total I think it was a number like 35%. You got that with that am I right? 35%.
Mark Douglas – Longbow Research: Yes. 
Frank Hermance: So, all the efforts and you’ve heard me talking about the expansion in the BRIC countries, the expansion in Asia, they are really coming to fruition now and it’s just an exciting time and even though, many of our peer companies are talking about issues in China and issues in Asia. We are simply outgrowing the market from both a product point of view and also we got very strong distribution capability there now. In Asia, we have approximately 300 people who are engaged in selling our products and that doesn’t include people in some cases were using distributors were not direct sales. So it doesn’t include the number of sales people that will be on the street in essence thought those distributors. These are about 300 people that are our AMETEK employees and it’s just paying off in super dividends. And you look at the lower organic growth in Europe and the US, we actually had a pretty difficult comparison that those numbers would probably be up closer to the mid single-digit area if you took out some of the large shipments that were done last year. So, just in general, Mark, we are feeling better, we are feeling better. I can tell you that it’s easier than it was six months ago to put up the results that we are putting up and that’s because these economies are starting to move in a direction that’s helping. So, it’s a tailwind instead of a headwind. And then you couple that with all of the operational things that we are doing and that’s what has given us these really superb results.
Mark Douglas – Longbow Research: Well, thanks for that. And then looking at your process business, can you discuss what’s happening in process, in particular what you are seeing in oil and gas?
Frank Hermance: Yes, it’s a great question Mark and as you are aware, over the last few years, oil and gas has been the driver to process and what is happening now which actually I view quite favorably is that there is balance now across all of those process businesses. So, in essence, we saw very strong growth in the non-oil and gas business. But oil and gas results are also good. It just wasn’t at the level that it was in terms of growth a year or two ago. So we are feeling pretty good about the process businesses, because, we’ve got that broad-based strength. We’ve talked a little bit about the ultra precision technology business. That is doing even exclusive of the acquisitions is doing extremely well organically. Our med division had a really good quarter which is in the process area and also our measurement calibration technology division was fine. So, there is a broader base now and we are not as dependent just on oil and gas. Although just to expand a bit. We see true opportunities in the fracking area. There is a lot going on in fracking. We think it’s going to expand in China and other places outside the US. So there are definite opportunities for us to continue to grow in oil and gas even as the market dynamics come down a bit from where they were a year or two ago.
Mark Douglas – Longbow Research: Okay, thank you.
Frank Hermance: Sure, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer:  Thanks. Good morning.
Frank Hermance: Hi, Chris.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: So what’s been asked, but just going back to the Asia mid-teens organic, obviously it sounds like a lot of internal execution there. But just wondered if you could kind of add some commentary on to the extent that you are you’ve really just lifted these to higher run rates versus now you have tough comps for next year with Asia?
Frank Hermance: Well, no, we think that – Chris, that we are going to continue to grow. So sure, we have improved our penetration in Asia. But we don’t consider it that it’s a new plateau that is going to be flat. We are going to continue to put investments in that region. We are putting in the BRIC countries which is a little bit broader obviously than just Asia. We are putting in about 50 people this year. We are adding additional manufacturing capability in Asia and that is key to access to the markets there as you have products that are locally built. So we are just going to continue to add to those regions and if you take China for instance, even though the GDP in China has come down from the 9% to 10% region to the 7%, 7.5% region. That GDP is still heck of a lot better than the US and Europe. So, we are going to continue to put investments in those regions and if you look at what has transpired in the company and just step back, the area that we were underpenetrated in was Asia. And if you look at the mix now of that 56% that is outside the United States, the mix has gone, it’s about 30% in Europe, it’s now 20% in Asia and I can remember that number when it was 10%. So, it’s now 20% and then you got 5% or 6% in sort of the other areas of the world. So, we are getting a better balance, but we are still not there. It’s still the part of the world, where I don’t feel we have our fair share. And we are just going to continue to go after it and hopefully, although the comps will be a little bit more difficult next year. We are going to be able to show you increased performance over the levels of this year.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks. Very helpful.
Frank Hermance: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is coming from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey good morning guys. It’s Drew on for Nigel.
Frank Hermance: Hi Drew.
Unidentified Analyst: Frank, just a question on M&A going – or M&A accretion going forward. I’m not sure how quantitative you can be here but maybe just qualitative given how much – how much synergy do you expect from the Zygo acquisition and then the other acquisitions to-date? Just what you are thinking about as far as accretion into 2015?
Frank Hermance: Yes, I haven’t actually quantified what that is going to be in 2015. It’s not significant in 2014. We will pick up a few pennies in 2014, but obviously as we start to put our synergies in place, and as I mentioned before, we are working through that. On Zygo, we will be able to quantify that, but I really don’t have a number right now for that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.
Frank Hermance: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Mason – Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Robert Mason – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Yes good morning.
Frank Hermance: Hi, Robert.
Robert Mason – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Frank, I wanted to know, if you could give us a feel for what pricing may have contributed to the 4% core growth in the quarter? And maybe how that compares to what you were getting earlier in the year?
Frank Hermance: Yes, it’s about the same and it was 1.5% in the second quarter, another measure of that, sometimes we talk about is pricing minus inflation, where inflation is essentially everything in the business. Salaries, materials, et cetera, et cetera and that number of pricing minus inflation was about 0.6%. So we focus on that. So that we do in fact, get some of the pricing to the bottom-line. So, that’s the best quantification I can give you and these are also not what I would call exact numbers, they are not the easiest thing to establish. But we have a practice in place that we are very consistent and so the numbers are comparable, but they are not what I would call a GAAP precise.
Robert Mason – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Sure, that’s helpful. And perhaps I missed it when you gave the run down on the aerospace business, but how did the military portion do in the quarter and the outlook there for the balance of the year? And if you have any insight in 2015 on military, that would be helpful?
Frank Hermance: It’s a great question and that was probably and has been for the first half of the year and for our forecast for the rest of the year, surprisingly good. It’s basically been in the low single-digit arena. And we are just not seeing a really major impact of sequestration in the US, US is down some, but it’s being compensated by our international military business which is about half of the overall military business. So, we actually thought it was going to be worst than what it is and I would say the outlook with everything I know in 2015 is going to be very similar. It’s not going to be a high growth segment, but it’s not going to be a major drain on the growth of the company.
Robert Mason – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay, that’s helpful. And lastly, we spent a fair amount of time today, just discussing your ultra precision portfolio. Do you have a ballpark number on the size of the market that you are now addressing there? And give us a feel for what your share is?
Frank Hermance: Yes, I think if you think about all of those businesses in UPT and you think about probably a 35% market share, and I am going to use rough numbers here, so, this is a $500 million business in very rough numbers. So, you are talking about $1.5 billion kind of market opportunity, but as you know, this business, like most AMETEK businesses is very niche-oriented. So, you can define the market in ways that either make it a very small market share or a very high market share. What I’ve given you is sort of an average of the way we think about it. But probably more importantly, it’s not only the share in that addressable market but as I said before, we have this internal process that we actually look at adjacencies around that. So we feel, we can continue to grow into other market segments. So, I mean, a great example of this, I’ll switch to a different part of the company, but when you look at the genesis of our power business, that actually came out of our aerospace business. We decided to take land gas turbines or excuse me – take aircraft engines and simply convert them to land gas turbines and that’s what got us started in the power business and now we have a $0.5 billion business. So, you can sort of expand your market by taking technologies and putting them in other market areas or just doing – take in existing products and putting them in new markets. So there is, many different ways you can do this, but I think, that one-third or 33% market share is the most best way I can answer your question.
Robert Mason – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay, that’s great. Thanks, Frank.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Graham from Jefferies, please proceed with your question.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: Hi, I didn’t want to take up too much air time before, if you don’t mind just answering one more question from me, Frank.
Frank Hermance: Sure Scott.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: The strength in the July orders, could you give us some little bit of color on that was it broad, was it a couple of businesses in particular and any type of number around that? Was that, you mean, that it was up more than the third quarter, whatever you can give us?
Frank Hermance: I didn’t catch the last part of your question, Scott. What was that?
Scott Graham – Jefferies: What was – when you say it was strong, did you mean to say that that’s because it was up more than in the third quarter or if you can give us a number or attach a number to it, that would even be better, but whatever you can do.
Frank Hermance: Okay, well, the trend is positive. It’s moving in an upward direction. The growth in orders was across the businesses it was not that we had one or two businesses that blew it out, it was – and I think that reflects the improvement in the overall global environment and when we look at July, it continued that trend. I really was focused on July. I wanted to see, how strong the orders came in and it was very good. So now, we’ll have to look at what occurs obviously in August which – this tend to be a little bit slower month and then hopefully, very, very good in September. But, I can’t really quantify it for you except to say it was broad-based. It was strong and I think it reflects the global environment from an organic viewpoint.
Scott Graham – Jefferies: Thanks very much.
Frank Hermance: You bet, Scott.

Frank Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. AMETEK had a really fine first quarter. We established quarterly records for orders, sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. We also remained very active on the acquisition front, acquiring Teseq and VTI Instruments in the first quarter and on April 11, we announced the definitive merger agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Zygo Corporation. I will touch on our continued strong acquisition performance in more detail later, but let me first provide the financial highlights for the quarter. Sales in the quarter were up 10% to $975.3 million. Organic sales increased 3% while acquisitions added 7% and currency added less than 1%. Operating income for the first quarter increased 12% to $221.6 million from $197.2 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our operational excellence activities. Operating income margin in the quarter was 22.7%, a 40-basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2013. Net income was up 12% to $140.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.57 were up 12% over last year’s first quarter and at the top end of our guidance range.  Orders in the quarter were a record $998 million, up 14% overall from the prior year, driven by solid organic growth and contributions from the recent acquisitions. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.02. Operating working capital was 17.9% of sales.  Turning our attention to the individual operating groups, the electronic instruments group had a very strong first quarter. Sales were up 18% to a record $572.4 million on strength in our longer-cycle aerospace and process businesses as well as strong growth in our heavy truck business. Overall, growth was also driven by the contributions from the acquisition of Controls Southeast, Creaform, Powervar, Teseq, and VTI. Organic sales were very solid, up 5%, while currency was flat. EIG’s operating income increased 14% to $150.3 million, and operating margins were 26.3%. Excluding the dilutive impact on operating margins of recent acquisitions, EIG’s operating margins would have been 27.6%, up 40 basis points from last year’s quarter.  The electromechanical group also had a good quarter, with strong operating performance. Sales were up 1% to a record $409.2 million. Organic sales were flat, and foreign currency was a 1% tailwind.  Strength in our precision motion control and thermal management systems businesses was offset by softness in our third-party aerospace MRO business as a result of a very difficult prior year comparison. EMG’s operating income increased 8% to a record $83.9 million, and operating margins were superb at 20.8%, up 120 basis points from last year’s first quarter.  Now, turning our attention to our core growth strategies of operational excellence, global market expansion, new product development, and strategic acquisitions. The solid execution of these growth strategies by our employees is the principal reason for our ongoing success. Each of these strategies will continue to play a key role in driving our growth. First, I will touch on operational excellence. Operational excellence is our cornerstone strategy. We continue to see tremendous results from our various operational excellence initiatives. Operational excellence activities include Lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office opportunities, Design for Six Sigma and our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, movement of production to low-cost locales, and value engineering.  In the first quarter, our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives recognized approximately $17 million in savings, exceeding our target for the quarter. We continue to expect approximately $90 million in total cost savings in 2014 through our operational excellence initiatives, including $60 million in savings through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. Now turning to global and market expansion, our seconds strategy, global and market expansion continues to be an important contributor to our growth as we are increasingly expanding our presence in attractive higher-growth market segments and geographic regions.  In the first quarter of 2014, international sales represented 56% of our total sales. This was up from 55% of sales in the first quarter of 2013. The increase in international sales percentage was driven by very strong organic growth in Asia as well as the contributions from recent acquisitions. Organic sales in Asia were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the first quarter, with notable strength across our process and differentiated EMG businesses. This strong growth reflects the benefits of our continued focus on expanding our sales, service, and distribution capabilities in this region. We will continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities, and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities. Now turning to new product development, new product development is a key internal growth driver and critical to our long term health and growth. We have consistently grown our investment in RD&E to ensure we are developing the right products to serve our customers and markets. In 2014, we expect to spend approximately $205 million, a 15% increase over 2013. And we are excited about some recent new product introductions within our aerospace and defense businesses.  First, AMETEK Rotron has developed a heat exchanger for pod-mounted optical and electronics systems aboard various aircraft, including helicopters and drones. The Discus thermal management system offers greater cooling capabilities and lower weight than other systems. Its novel design separates external cooling air from compartment air, which is a key advantage for protecting sensitive optical and electronic equipment from possible contaminants. We are seeing very strong interest in this new product.  Secondly, AMETEK sensors and fluid management systems has introduced the first digital humidity sensor for aircraft environmental control systems. The sensor is the smartest and most attractive humidity sensor available and is intended for air ducting that carries humidified air into aircraft passenger compartments. The sensor utilizes advanced capacitance technology and signal processing to quickly and accurately measure humidity levels.  And also, AMETEK EDAX has developed an entirely new technique for users of scanning electron microscopes that provides them with unprecedented flexibility in conducting microstructure analysis.  The technique, which is known as pattern region of interest analysis, or PRIAS, represents a breakthrough in advanced material analysis by combining fast imaging capabilities with powerful image manipulation and analysis tools for use in scanning electron microscopes. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 20% of sales in the first quarter.  Now, turning our attention to acquisitions, we’ve had a very active start to 2014. In the first quarter, we completed two acquisitions, Teseq, which we acquired in January, and VTI Instruments, which we acquired in February. Combined, we deployed approximately $165 million on these two acquisitions, and acquired approximately $90 million in sales. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we announced that we had signed a merger agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Zygo Corporation.  This strong acquisition performance in 2014 follows the strong activity we saw in the second half of 2013, where we acquired three businesses. If the Zygo transaction closes as expected by the end of the second quarter, we will have acquired six businesses, deployed approximately $850 million in capital, and acquired $425 million in annual revenue over the prior 12 months. Now, let me provide some more detail on the VTI Instruments acquisition and the Zygo announcement. VTI Instruments is a leading producer of highly engineered test and measurement instrumentation. Their products include signal conditioning solutions and data acquisition systems for use in structural, fatigue, temperature, noise, vibration, and harshness testing. VTI is a leader in the high-end niche for data acquisition systems for use in demanding testing environments requiring high measurement accuracy such as the aerospace and defense markets. The acquisition of VTI Instruments nicely expands our test and measurement capabilities within this attractive market segment. They are headquartered in Irvine, California, and they have annual sales of approximately $40 million. On April 11, we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Zygo Corporation at a purchase price of $19.25 per share. The aggregate enterprise value of the transaction is approximately $280 million, taking into account Zygo’s outstanding equity awards and net cash, which we will acquire. Zygo Corporation is a leading provider of non-contract metrology solutions, high precision optics, and optical assemblies for use in semiconductor, medical, life science, industrial, and aerospace and defense end markets. They are really a great fit with AMETEK. They have a high-value, differentiated technology capability and strong brands within the optical and metrology markets. Also, Zygo’s leading position in non-contact optical metrology nicely complements our strength in contact metrology. Zygo has annual sales of approximately $165 million and they are headquartered in Middlefield, Connecticut. The closing of the transaction is subject to customer closing conditions including the approval of Zygo stockholders and applicable regulatory approvals. We expect to close the transaction towards the end of the second quarter. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us in the remainder of 2014, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunity remains very strong, and we have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to continue to support this acquisitions focus.  Turning now to the outlook for the remainder of 2014, we expect our businesses overall to continue to show solid growth during 2014, with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We anticipate 2014 revenue to be up high single-digits on a percentage basis from 2013. Organic growth is expected to be up 2% to 4% for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2014 are expected to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.37 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% over 2013, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our operational excellence initiatives, and the benefit of contributions from recent acquisitions. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $2.30 to $2.35 per diluted share, and does not include the impact of the announced Zygo acquisition.  Second quarter 2014 sales are expected to be up approximately 10% from last year’s second quarter, with organic growth up low single digits. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% over last year’s second quarter. So, in summary, we delivered excellent results in the quarter, and are well-positioned for the remainder of 2014. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that will provide us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our excellent backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2014. Bob will now cover some of the financial details and then we will be glad to take your questions.
Robert Mandos : Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a great first quarter, with very strong overall results. I will provide some further details. Core growth in selling expenses was in line with core growth in sales in the quarter. General and administrative expenses were roughly flat versus last year. On a percentage basis, G&A was 1.3% of sales, down slightly from last year’s first quarter level of 1.4% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.3% versus last year’s first quarter rate of 29.1%. For 2014, we expect our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.9% of sales in the first quarter, up slightly from last year’s first quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority.  Capital expenditures were $14 million for the quarter. Full year 2014 capital expenditures are expected to be $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $33 million for the quarter. 2014 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $137 million. Operating cash flow was $161 million, up 3% over last year’s first quarter. Free cash flow was $147 million for the quarter, representing 104% of net income. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 110% of net income. Total debt was $1.41 billion at March 31, essentially unchanged from the 2013 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $265 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at March 31 of 25.9%, down slightly from 26.3% at the end of 2013. At March 31, we had approximately $865 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives.  During the quarter, we acquired Teseq and VTI Instruments. Total capital deployed on these acquisitions was approximately $165 million. On April 11, we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of Zygo Corporation. Total capital to be deployed on this acquisition will be approximately $280 million, taking into account net cash to be acquired. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.  In summary, we had a very strong first quarter, establishing record levels of orders, sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. We are well-positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.
Kevin Coleman: Great. Thank you, Bob. Operator, we’ll now open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions.] And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. 
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: Frank, if you could just sort of do the deeper dive that you typically do on the call with respect to the operating groups, what you saw during the quarter and what your expectations are for the year?
Frank Hermance : We’ll start with EIG. Our EIG aerospace business had a strong quarter on continued strength in commercial aerospace. Sales were up approximately 10% organically in the quarter and orders were also very strong, up high single-digits.  And as we look to the remainder of 2014, we expect continued strength in our EIG aerospace business. Trends in OEM build rates support really good commercial sales, while the continued ramp up of key business and regional jet platforms also will provide solid growth.  As a side note, if you look at Boeing and Airbus, their production this year, the sum of the two is expected to be up about 6%, with Boeing actually up about 12% and Airbus up about 1%. So very good, solid performance here in terms of the aerospace market itself. So for all of 2014, we are estimating EIG aerospace would be up mid-single digits and we may very well be conservative on that outlook. Moving to our process businesses, the overall performance of our process businesses was superb. Sales were up midteens on a percentage basis, with organic sales up high single-digits. Organic growth was broad-based across our process businesses, with strength in our Micro-Poise, UPT technology, measurement and calibration technology, and our material analysis operations. So this is a bit of a change, where if you look at the beginning of last year, this business was being driven by oil and gas. Oil and gas is still fine, but now we’re really seeing broad-based recovery in the process businesses. The overall growth was also driven by the contributions from the Controls Southeast, Creaform, and VTI acquisitions. So for the full year, we expect our process businesses to grow high single-digits overall, with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. The last part of EIG is power and industrial. Sales for power and industrial were up about 30% in the first quarter, really driven by the contribution from the recent acquisitions of Powervar and Teseq. Organically, sales for power and industrial were flat, and as a result of these recent acquisitions in the power segment, we expect overall sales for power and industrial to be up approximately 30% in 2014 with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. So, Matt, if you take those three parts of EIG and sum them, for all of EIG we’re expecting overall 2014 sales to be up midteens on a percentage basis, with organic growth up low to mid-single digits.  Moving to the other half of the company, overall sales for our differentiated businesses were up low single digit on a percentage basis in the quarter. We saw very solid growth in our precision motion control and thermal systems business, but it was offset by weakness in our third-party MRO business and that was driven really as the result of a very difficult last year comparison in that MRO business.  For 2014, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up low to mid-single digits on an organic basis. And the last part of the company, which is floor care and specialty motors, sales in our floor care and specialty motors businesses were up low single digits in the quarter and for all of 2014, we expect sales for this business to be up low single digits. So if you sum those pieces of EMG, for all of EMG, for 2014, we are expecting overall growth of low to mid-single digits. And if you take the results I just went over and take EIG and EMG together, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, for AMETEK as a whole we expect this high single-digit sales growth with organic growth up 2% to 4%. So Matt, that’s a summary.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc : Thank you so much. And then just one quick follow up. Organic bookings in the quarter, and then where your backlog ended?
Frank Hermance : Backlog ended at $1.2 billion. It was up from $1.1 billion as I mentioned. Orders were up about 14% overall to $998 million, and organically, that was up about in line with sales. It was 2.5% organically.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. 
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo: On acquisitions, Frank, you touched on managerial capacity. And you’ve done a number of acquisitions here. Are there any management constraints that are causing you to maybe refocus near term what you’re thinking of acquiring? 
Frank Hermance : No, not at all. One of the advantages of the way we have evolved the company is we have a number of what I would call sublegs in the company, where we can put deals in. And as we look at our deals, I surely don’t want multiple deals being driven by the same management team, but because we have these other legs, we can continue to do this. And one of the really positive things here is a number of our divisions now have risen in their capability, where in essence they can handle the deals, where if you go back in time, they were more handled by us at the corporate level.  So we can continue to do this, we can continue to roll them up. Obviously, we’re not doing the megadeals, which then this strategy wouldn’t work. But by buying these companies that are in the $50 million to $200 million in sales region, we can continue this, and we really don’t have any significant management constraints. 
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo : And just going on to the sourcing area, you’ve talked about you were a bit ahead in your goals, but you kept the total year the same. Did you move programs up? Is it acquisitions? How should we be thinking about that number?
Frank Hermance : I think what you’re probably going to see is that we will raise that number as we go through the rest of the year. Actually, Bob, I think when we rolled it up, it was really $92 million?
Robert Mandos : Yes.
Frank Hermance : It was actually $92 million, but we decided not to sort of put that extra $2 million in. But I would expect, as we go forward, that the team is doing a really superb job here and so I would expect that number to increment up as we go through the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : Quickly, payables?
Robert Mandos : $370 million.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : Frank, looking at the slight increase in your EPS guidance for 2014, you’re keeping organic growth expectations the same, so is this, with this slightly improved margin, a little better performance on the cost takeouts or the operational excellence?
Frank Hermance : Yeah, I think that’s an accurate way of talking about it. And also, if you look at the trend of organic growth in the company, the trend is definitely in a positive direction looking over the last three quarters or four quarters. So we’ve been probably a bit conservative on our sales outlook. And if that organic growth does continue to creep up more towards the higher end of our guidance range, that also is going to obviously provide some more earnings.  So we’re actually feeling pretty good right now, that although this recovery is a bit slow and painful, we definitely can feel it and see it in the numbers, that there is improvement as you go quarter to quarter. It’s not monumental, but it’s still there, so the trend is in the right direction. So we felt pretty confident in raising the estimates that couple cents. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : Camping out on the organic growth then, I’m a little surprised, given how Q1 performed, that you’re still expecting 2% to 4% for each segment. Q1 is actually an easier comp, I think, for both. Q4 becomes a pretty tough comp for both. But you had 5% organic in EIG and flat organic in EMG. With the strong start in EIG, I’m surprised you kept that at 2% to 4%, and with the slower start EMG, that it’s still 2% to 4%.
Frank Hermance : One of the areas of weakness that you heard me talk about was power and industrial, and that’s sort of the one large segment in our business where the organic growth just is not as strong as we had hoped. And even though aerospace is doing great and our processes businesses themselves are doing very, very well, power and industrial is a bit of a drag. But what we’re hoping is we’re going to see incremental improvement in that as we go forward. But we haven’t put that in our forecast, and that’s probably the reason that we’ve held that guidance a bit low on the EMG side.  On the EMG side, we were flat in the first quarter, but we are predicting that we’re going to be in that low to mid-single digits. So we do expect that to definitely improve, and that’s why hopefully we’re going to end up at the higher end of our overall guidance for the company of a 2% to 4% kind of number. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : Were the orders in EMG better than the sales?
Frank Hermance : No. Orders were not as strong in EMG. Organically, they were down a bit and they were up about 6%, if I recall correctly, in EIG. But you have to be careful, when you look at orders for our businesses, because we’ve got many long cycle businesses that basically you can have ups and downs in any quarter, so I wouldn’t focus too much on the order intake in a given quarter. But I do think you’re going to see EMG organic growth improve, and we may be conservative on EIG organic growth. That’s probably the best way I can answer your question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with Citi Research. 
Matt McConnell - Citi Research: Could you talk about the EMG margin a little bit? You’ve had a pretty nice increase on virtually no revenue growth, so is that where you saw the upside from the cost savings, or is there something else in there that is worth calling out?
Frank Hermance : No, it’s exactly what you said, and we have been saying for a long time when we look at overall margin growth for the company, that EMG will be a key driver. Because if you look at the absolute levels of the margin between EIG and EMG, EIG was the 26.3%, I think it was, and EMG at around 20.8%.  So there’s two drivers for that. There’s definitely the cost reductions and some of the improvements that we have put through the business have definitely been in EMG. There’s also a natural effect that as the portion of EMG moves more to the differentiated businesses versus the floor care and specialty motors or cost driven side of that business, there will be a natural positive movement in those margins.  And as you know, we’re not buying companies or investing heavily in the floor care or specialty motors business, where we are in the differentiated EMG businesses, so you’ll continue to see that basic change in the portfolio, which will also be a positive for margins.
Matt McConnell - Citi Research : And then if I could touch on the M&A pipeline, it seems from your prepared remarks that clearly there’s some activity there. So if you could highlight any particular areas where you’re seeing a lot of activity? And maybe deal size. I know Zygo, at $280 million, it’s a little bigger than the range that you mentioned in response to an earlier question. So do you think that is within your sweet spot now? Or maybe give us an update on what you think the sweet spot for deal size is for AMETEK now?
Frank Hermance : Obviously the deal sizes are going to increase a bit as our overall size increases, but it’s not monumental. And we have really been looking in this $50 million to $200 million in sales arena. Zygo is in the $165 million arena, so I consider that in the sweet spot. But if you look at the two other deals we did this quarter, the first one, Teseq, was I think $50 million. VTI was $40 million, so that’s sort of the range that we’re looking in.  In terms of the backlog, I’m delighted with the backlog right now. Our team both in corporate and the M&A people that we have put in our businesses have done just an excellent job of getting deals up on the table. And some of these deals are proprietary, where we have gone out and talked to these companies, sometimes for many, many years, and then when they are ready to sell, they will come to us, and in some cases not even go through an investment banking kind of process.  So we have a really, I would say, solid backlog. I can tell you I’m working on a deal just as we speak. I don’t know whether we’re going to get the deal or not, but in terms of capital deployed, that particular deal would be larger than Zygo. But not, again, monumentally larger, but it would be a larger deal.  So if I said something in my opening remarks that implied a major change, that, I don’t think, is the case. It’s really I would say an incremental sort of change to be looking at a little bit bigger deals, but nothing fundamental in terms of looking, for instance, for a merger of equals. That’s not even in our paradigm. You’re unable to get the synergies and unable to going to the returns that you guys enjoy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jeffries.
Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company : Just wanted to ask about the progression of orders in the quarter. Were you weather affected in any way? Was March stronger? Could you lay that out a little bit?
Frank Hermance : I would say incrementally we improved during the quarter. March was very, very good. We can’t assign a major sort of factor to weather. I know a lot of companies have come out and said January and February were weaker because of weather. I really can’t say that there was any substantial change due to that factor. What I’m seeing, and what I’m just feeling in the business, to my comments before, is we’re just seeing a gradual improvement in the business, and we definitely saw that, I would say, through the quarter, with a pretty strong March.
Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company : So the March reference that you’re making here, that’s on a year over year basis? That’s not seasonal, right?
Frank Hermance : Well, I was actually talking sequentially through the quarter. I wasn’t talking quarter over quarter when I was making my remarks.
Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company : That’s actually what I was referring to, because obviously I think we all get stronger as the quarter progresses. I was just wondering on the year over year basis.
Frank Hermance : Oh, I’m sorry, I misinterpreted your question. On a year over year basis, yeah, it’s better, there’s no question. As I said, we were up just about 3 points organically in the quarter on orders. And if you look at the order progression and the sales progression, any organic growth is getting stronger. It’s not monumental, but you can feel it getting stronger.
Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company :
 : There’s $92 million and potentially heading higher. Obviously EMG is seeing a lot of that, but where are you finding this type of a number? Where are the heaviest concentrations of productivity right now?
Robert Mandos :  I would say it’s probably more on the global sourcing side, and it’s pretty broad-based across the company. We keep looking for new opportunities. We’re expanding our footprint, not just in China, but we move in other low-cost regions. Our teams work very effectively together, and we see those opportunities and we push pretty hard, as you can imagine. We’re getting leverage on just the pure procurement side, but we’re also getting it in the value add and value engineer. And that’s a key part of how we are growing these savings. As we’ve acquired companies with higher levels of technology, there’s more opportunity there.
Frank Hermance : If I could just augment what Bob said, we find when we acquire companies there’s significant leverage in just procuring parts from international, so that a good part of the leverage comes from the companies that we’ve recently acquired. If we look at more of our mature businesses, where they are already procuring a large amount of their material from low-cost regions, that’s where the value analysis and value engineering that Bob mentioned comes into play.  And we have really put, across the company, the training that is necessary to do value analysis and value engineering, and these are very short term projects that basically you can improve the cost of the product, largely through materials, but not solely through materials. That’s more the value analysis piece, and then the value engineering piece is more in the sense of making some changes in the product so that you can get incremental sales.  And we are now allocating a portion of our engineering talent to this VA/VE activity, so that we can just keep this number rolling. So it’s just a super strategy, and it’s working extremely well for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Baliotti from Janney Capital Markets.
John Baliotti - Janney Capital Markets : Frank, you talked about the margin impact from acquisitions in EIG, which is obviously typical of new deals. But you also pointed out that EMG had very impressive margins. I think if I went back in my model, I don’t think they were ever this high in the first quarter going back 15 or 20 years. So I’m wondering, it seems like that bodes very well for the things you’ve been talking about, of global sourcing, just integrating the cost structure of the businesses, not to mention the revenue leverage on future EIG margins.
Frank Hermance : I think that’s right. I think your analysis is correct, and I think as we do deals, you’re going to continue to see some dilutive impact on our margins, because we purposely want to buy companies where their margins are below ours, so that we can, over time, improve those businesses.  And if you look historically, we’ve always been able to outgrow that dilutive impact. So even with the dilutive impact that you’ve talked about, even though we talked about it just in EIG, if you look at it at a company level, it was about 50 basis points. So we showed 40 basis points of improvement, and if you add that dilutive impact, our overall company margins would have been up 90 basis points instead of 40 basis points.  So your discussion and what Scott just talked about and asked a question on are really the core of AMETEK. We’re just really good at basically managing our businesses effectively and if our businesses come in with a budget that doesn’t show sizable cost improvements, we have a long discussion about that, because we feel you’ve got to be continually improving your business and continually improving your margins. And yes, I think you’re going to see more improvement in EIG and EMG just because of the level of absolute margins in the EMG side of the business. 
John Baliotti - Janney Capital Markets : You talked about obviously that you expect a lot more improvement out of EMG given the delta between the two, but it seems like you’re probably going to keep raising the bar on EIG, given the near term headwinds that it faces as you do more of the M&A on that segment.
Frank Hermance : That could be, but now remember, the Zygo acquisition, if we close it, is going to come in and it’s going to go in EIG. So it’s public, and therefore there’s going to be a dilutive impact. But we look at that positively, because we’re going to get a super return on invested capital on a deal like that.
John Baliotti - Janney Capital Markets : I guess the conclusion was that you clearly haven’t peaked on the profitability of EMG on a core basis.
Frank Hermance : Absolutely. That’s absolutely right. We have not peaked. That’s absolutely right.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital Markets 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: On the geographical look, I know you talked about midteens organic growth in Asia. Can you maybe talk about what you’re seeing in other geographies and maybe how you see some of the regional patterns playing out for the year?
Frank Hermance : If you look at the organic growth by region for the first quarter, the organic growth largely came out of Asia. It was up about 17%, actually, in Asia. The U.S. was flat, but that’s actually an improving trend if you look at this by sequential quarters. The U.S. is continuing to improve and we think that will continue as we go through the year. Europe was organically up about 1%, and that’s a lower number than what we had been talking about. But there was an abnormality in Europe in that as I mentioned in my remarks, the MRO business basically, which is largely European based, had a very tough comparison.  And so if you actually extract that from the Europe organic growth, it would be similar to what we’ve seen in the last few quarters, up in that mid-single digit region, and improving. I mean, again, you can feel some improvement in Europe. It’s not monumental, but the improvement is there. And then Asia, up very, very strong. And this was across Asia that we saw this. And I think I can say it’s a key result of the investments that we have been putting into Asia. A large portion of our incremental growth capital or growth expense has gone into that region, and we saw broad-based performance with very strong performance in Japan, for instance, very strong performance in Singapore. Strong performance in China. Korea, Bob just mentioned, which is absolutely right. We saw strong performance there.  You know, the markets are not great, but on the other hand, the GDPs in those countries are still higher than they are in other parts of the world. And you couple that with our lower share and investment levels, and it’s doing just find for us. So we were very pleased. So I think the expectations are, incremental improvement in the U.S., Europe will, I think, pop back a bit, just because of that tough comparison. And Asia is going to be good. Is it going to be 17% growth for the next few quarters on a quarter over quarter basis? Probably not quite that strong, but it’s going to be good.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : And then maybe just a quick one on EIG margins. You broke out the 130 basis point impact from acquisitions. Will the impact be a little bit heavier in Q2, given the activity Zygo?
Frank Hermance : It obviously depends on when Zygo closes, and that’s going to close at the end of the quarter. So if it happens then, it’s not going to have a major impact on Q2. You would see it more in Q3 than Q2. I think probably the soonest would be the second week in June. That probably won’t happen, but that’s the soonest. So as I’m thinking about your question, there probably is not going to be any major impact, even if it closes a bit earlier in the second quarter. But you can expect to see it in the third quarter.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your closing remarks.

Frank S. Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. AMETEK had an excellent fourth quarter to complete another strong year. In the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. We were also very active on the acquisition front during the quarter, acquiring a number of highly strategic businesses. For the full year, we established records for essentially all key financial metrics, including sales, operating income, operating margin, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Sales were up 8% for the year; operating income was up 9%; operating margins expanded 30 basis points to 22.7%; and diluted earnings per share ended at $2.10, a 12% increase over 2012's diluted earnings per share. Focusing on the fourth quarter, sales increased 12% to $942.5 million. Organic growth was very strong, up 7% on broad-based strength across most of our businesses, while acquisitions added 4%, and currency added 1%. Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 11% to $210.5 million. Operating income margin in the quarter was 22.3% compared to 22.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Net income was up 13% to $135.7 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.55 were up 12% over last year's fourth quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow was excellent. It was $210 million for the fourth quarter and $661 million for the year, both up 8%. Free cash flow was very strong at 135% of net income in the fourth quarter and 116% of net income for the full year. Working capital management was outstanding at 16.7% of sales in the quarter. This represents a record level. Orders in the quarter were $912 million, up 3% organically on an adjusted basis. Now turning to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a strong fourth quarter and an excellent year. For the quarter, sales were up 15% to $566.9 million on broad-based strength across our Process businesses, plus the contributions from the acquisitions of Controls Southeast, Creaform and Powervar. Internal growth was strong, up 7%, while acquisitions added 7% and foreign currency added 1%. EIG's operating income increased 13% to $151.9 million, and operating margins were 26.8%. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions and the additional growth investments made in the quarter, EIG's operating margins were 27.5%, up 20 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter. The Electromechanical Group also had a very good quarter. Sales were up 8% to $375.6 million on strong growth across all of our differentiated businesses as well as excellent growth in our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business. Organic sales were up 7%, and foreign currency added 1%. EMG's operating income increased 8% to $70.5 million, and operating margins were 18.8% in the quarter. Now turning to our 4 growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions. First, I will touch on acquisitions. We had a very active quarter with the acquisitions of Creaform and Powervar. In addition, we acquired Teseq in early January. Combined, we deployed approximately $340 million on these acquisitions and acquired approximately $175 million in revenue. For the full year, including Teseq, we acquired 4 businesses, deployed approximately $500 million in capital and acquired $225 million in revenue. I will provide some highlights of Powervar and Teseq. Powervar and Teseq are both excellent acquisitions for AMETEK. Their products, technologies and markets are highly complementary with our existing power businesses. Equally important, these acquisitions expand the size and capabilities of our Power business. As I have highlighted in the past, we view our Power business as a very attractive platform from which we can grow significantly, both internally and through strategic acquisitions like Powervar and Teseq. With these 2 acquisitions, our Power business now totals approximately $500 million in sales. Our businesses have market-leading positions in power quality instruments for power generation and transmission and distribution, back-up power systems for highly ruggedized environments and test and measurement power solutions for a range of test applications. We remain very excited about the opportunities within our Power business. Powervar is a leading provider of power management and UPS systems used in medical, life sciences, industrial and retail applications. They provide highly engineered and customized power conditioning and UPS products designed to deliver reliable, high-quality power to critical applications. Powervar's strong presence in medical and life sciences provides our Power business with excellent new growth opportunities in these attractive market segments. Additionally, their products and technologies are highly complementary with our existing power quality and UPS systems. Powervar was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $70 million. The business is headquartered in Waukegan, Illinois. Teseq is a leading manufacturer of electrical test systems and instruments for use in electromagnetic compatibility emissions and immunity testing. Products include a broad line of conducted and radiated EMC compliance testing systems and RF amplifiers used for a wide range of industries, including aerospace and automotive electronics, medical equipment, telecommunications and transportation. Teseq is a good addition to our electrical test and measurement business. Their products and markets are complementary with our EM Test business, which we acquired in 2011. In addition, Teseq provides us with opportunities for accelerating product innovation and market expansion worldwide. Teseq was privately held with annual sales of about $53 million, and the business is headquartered in Luterbach, Switzerland and has additional facilities in the U.K., Germany and the U.S. Acquisitions will continue to be a key focus for us during 2014 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our pipeline of deals is excellent, our balance sheet is strong and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. Now turning to global and market expansion. Global and market expansion continues to be an important driver for AMETEK's growth. In the fourth quarter, international sales represented a record 57% of our total sales. The strong performance was driven by excellent organic growth in our international markets and the benefits from recent acquisitions. Sales growth in the BRIC regions was also very strong, up 11% organically in the quarter. These results also reflect the continued investments we are making to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive growth opportunities in these international markets. In the fourth quarter, AMETEK's Micro-Poise Measurement Systems business, which we acquired in 2012, secured a number of large orders for their Modular Tire Measurement Systems within the BRIC regions. Overall, orders for Micro-Poise in the BRIC regions were up over 50% in the quarter with $7 million worth of orders in China and India for these modular measurement systems. Micro-Poise's tire measurement systems combine uniformity, balance and geometry measurement capability in a single machine. We have seen strong demand in emerging markets for these systems as a result of ongoing expansion of tire manufacturing capacity in these markets. In addition, we have made a number of investments and improvements in the global sales, service and distribution structure within Micro-Poise since the time of acquisition. Moving on to our third strategy, new product development remains key to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. In 2013, we spent $179 million, which was up 16% from 2012. In 2014, we expect to spend approximately $200 million, a 12% increase over 2013. We're excited about some recent new product introductions. Vision Research, the leader in high-speed digital imaging, unveiled the latest addition to its Phantom line of ultra high-speed cameras, the Phantom v2010. The Phantom v2010 delivers more than 22,000 frames per second at full megapixel resolution and is the world's fastest high-resolution digital camera. With the v2010, Vision Research brings a new level of performance to scientists, researchers and engineers, who need to capture high-speed digital images, and further reinforces our commitment to offering the most innovative products in the digital high-speed imaging market. AMETEK's Atlas Material Testing Technology business launched the Xenotest 440, a new weathering instrument suitable for accelerated weather testing of a variety of materials. The instrument incorporates a new twin-lamp operating technology that allows it to achieve higher irradiance levels that can significantly reduce test times. It also utilizes a new technology for extending the service life of the instrument's xenon lamps, increasing the instrument's uptime and reducing lamp's operating cost by more than 30%. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 21% of sales in the quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. Lastly, I will touch on operational excellence. We continue to see tremendous results from our various operational excellence initiatives. Our management teams and employees continue to do an excellent job driving continual operational improvements through their businesses by leveraging the numerous operational excellence tools we have put in place in our company. Key tenets of our operational excellence activities include Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, moving our production to low-cost locales and value engineering. Through our global sourcing and strategic procurement activities, we recognized $16 million in savings in the fourth quarter and $62 million in savings for all of 2013. Overall, we realized approximately $100 million in total cost savings in 2013 through our various operational excellence initiatives. For 2014, we expect approximately $90 million in total cost savings through our operational excellence initiatives, including $60 million in savings through our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. Turning to the outlook now for 2014. We expect our businesses overall to show solid growth during 2014 with balanced organic growth across both operating groups. We anticipate 2014 revenue to be up high single digits on a percentage basis from 2013. Organic growth is expected to be up 2% to 4% for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2014 are expected to be in a range of $2.30 to $2.35 per diluted share, up 10% to 12% over 2013, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our operational initiatives and the benefit of contributions from recent acquisitions. First quarter 2014 sales are expected to be up high single digits from last year's first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.55 to $0.57 per diluted share, up 8% to 12% over last year's first quarter. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2014. So in summary, our overall business has performed very well in the fourth quarter and in 2013, producing records for essentially all key financial metrics. Although the macroeconomic conditions created a more challenging environment in 2013 than we expected, our team did an excellent job, and we were able to deliver exceptional operating results through a focus on executing our 4 growth strategies. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. We look forward to another successful year in 2014. Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions.
Robert R. Mandos: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had an excellent fourth quarter with strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, core growth in selling expenses was in line with core growth in sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, in line with last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, down from last year's fourth quarter rate of 29.8%. The full year tax rate was 28.7% versus last year's rate of 30.7%. We are very pleased with the success of our ongoing international and state tax planning initiatives on our fourth quarter and full year rates reflect the positive impact of these initiatives. As a result, for 2014, we estimate our tax rate to be between 28% and 29%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 16.7% of sales in the fourth quarter. This record low level of working capital positioned AMETEK as one of the top performers in our peer group and is a direct reflection of the tremendous strides our business units have taken in driving towards operating excellence. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending was $26 million for the quarter and $63 million for the full year. Full year 2013 capital expenditures were 1.8% of sales. 2014 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. Depreciation and amortization was $32 million for the quarter and $119 million for the full year. 2014 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $134 million. Our cash flow was excellent in the quarter and for the full year. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year were records. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $210 million, up 8% over last year's fourth quarter. Full year operating cash flow was $661 million, also up 8%. Free cash flow was excellent at $183 million in the quarter, representing 135% of net income. For the full year, free cash flow was $597 million, approximately 116% of net income, continuing our strong free cash flow generation. Our cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we expended approximately $414 million on transactions in 2013. Total debt was $1.42 billion at December 31, down $39 million from 2012 year end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $295 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at December 31 of 26%, down from 34% at the end of 2012. At December 31, we had approximately $880 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we acquired Teseq. Capital deployed on this acquisition was approximately $90 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, we extended the term of our $700 million revolving credit facility back to its original 5-year period. Our revolver now extends until December of 2018. All other terms of the revolving credit facility remain unchanged. In summary, we had an outstanding 2013, establishing records for essentially all the key financial metrics. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.
Frank S. Hermance: Great. Thanks, Bob. We'll now open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt McConnell of Citi Research.
Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: So if I can start with incrementals. They were a bit below trend. I know there might be mix issues with Floorcare being stronger and, obviously, a couple of deals recently. But were there any other drags that are worth calling out? And maybe, could you quantify the impact of Floorcare and the acquisitions?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, if you look at the impact, we started in EIG, there was definitely an impact from the acquisitions because that's where we did those deals. And also, we made incremental growth investments there, and they were on the order of $3 million there. And then in terms of EMG, there was a fairly significant mix shift. Floorcare and Specialty Motors was actually up organically mid-teens. So very, very strong performance in the quarter. And although the differentiated part of EMG continued to be strong, there was that mix shift, and that caused margins to be flat where they probably would have been up 20 to 30 basis points.
Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. And what's your expectation for margin expansion in the 2014 guidance? And then, maybe my final question would be did you quantify the growth investments that you anticipate for 2014?
Frank S. Hermance: Sure. In terms of margin performance, that's included in our guidance. We are assuming about 20 to 30 basis points of margin enhancement on the operating income line. In terms of the growth investments that we are putting into the business in 2014, it's approximately $40 million. And those growth investments are going to go into continued expansion of our sales, service and distribution channels, largely international locations but not solely. And also, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're going to increase our RD&E spending from roughly $179 million up to just around $200 million, which is a 12% increase in RD&E. So we are definitely going to continue to make investments in the growth of the business organically, and then, obviously, we'll use our free cash flow to deploy on acquisitions.
Operator: And our next question comes from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Just going on Matt's question, can you -- with the margin expansion, that 20 to 30 basis points, can you quantify maybe what that acquisition impact is and what you've just done?
Frank S. Hermance: I don't actually have a number to exactly what it would be, but roughly on the order of 30 basis points.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, perfect. And then just touching on emerging markets. It sounds like select businesses are -- in your BRIC regions are getting some orders. But how are you thinking about that for '14? Obviously, there's been a lot of noise in news about challenges over there.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, it's actually amazing. We were very delighted in the quarter when we looked at our international businesses, actually, believe it or not, both in Europe and in Asia. In Asia, the organic growth was up about 25%, in Asia. So a truly outstanding quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in the BRIC countries, it's up about 11%. And as we're looking into 2014, in the BRIC regions, we're assuming a low double-digit type of growth rate. Obviously, that growth rate is higher than the intrinsic growth in those markets and is a direct reflection of the investments that we have been putting in that part of the world and the fact that our shares, in particular in BRIC and, to even a larger extent, throughout Asia, are a bit less than in other parts of the world. So we're able to gain a reasonable share. So a very, very good quarter. And we're feeling fairly good about next year in those regions. As I mentioned, surprisingly, Europe was strong for us. It was up actually in the double digits organically. And it was fairly broad based, you may recall in some of our previous calls where I talked about it being driven by aerospace and oil and gas. Now they were still very strong, but we also saw reasonable strength in many of our businesses, actually, throughout most of the Process businesses and also some in our Power segment. So things feel a little bit better in Europe, and that's a good thing.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Baliotti of Janney Capital Markets.
John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Frank, I was wondering maybe for -- now that you've clearly moved into the large cap arena and there may be more people that are attracted to the company, I was just wondering if you could -- you've done a lot of deals over the years, and maybe if we can just take a look at the -- or just talk about the ones you've done sort of the last 12 to 14 months. Could you kind of -- if you want to sort of summarize how these complement the growth strategy? I know you touched on Powervar and Teseq. But along those lines, maybe touch on what kind of operators that you've been developing over the years to run these platforms?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, you're hitting on a very, very key point, John. And that is the key of our strategy is to basically have first-class operating managers that can not only identify acquisitions but be able to accurately predict and execute what synergies we can get from the deals that we acquire. And our operating teams have just done an incredible job of taking the businesses that we've acquired over the time frame you're talking about or even over a longer time period and being able to get really good synergies, both on the cost side as well as the distribution and growth side. And what we have done is put in place a methodology so that we are continually growing the talent and doing cross-training in our businesses so that the talent continues to grow and can get involved in more and more deals as the company gets bigger. I often joke inside the company that if I go back 15 years ago when I first became CEO, I was basically doing all the deals. And now, the teams do the deals. They just do a great job, and they know how to do them and they know how to get them done. Talking about some of the other deals that I didn't specifically highlight in my talk, the deal before Powervar and Teseq was Creaform. Creaform, just a super deal. Very high-technology company basically involved in ultra-precision mobile measurement capability. This company is located in Quebec. The management team has come in to AMETEK. And I'm sure some of them are listening, and I will compliment them. They've done an excellent job getting used to our operating philosophies. And the business is growing, and it's exceeding the model that we've put in place for that business. The deal before that was Controls Southeast. That particular deal was an augmentation of our O'Brien deal, which we did a couple of years, again -- or maybe 1 year before that, which is involved in sort of the aftermarket part of our Process businesses. So all of these deals were in an area that we know something about them, it's not like we're doing deals that are outside of our knowledge base, so that we take very little risk from the market viewpoint when we do the deals, and then we can leverage those deals with our operating capabilities.
John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Yet it seems -- I know it's relatively small compared to the other ones, but it's -- Creaform seems like a very interesting acquisition. And given your -- what you've been able to do with some of your other businesses that are more traditional and being able to grow them, it should be interesting to see how you leverage that acquisition.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, we see that definitely as a high-growth type of business for us. As I mentioned, very strong management team, and we're just going to support them in growing that business because we think it's got phenomenal opportunity.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Summerville of KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Frank, can you disclose what orders in backlog look like and then what organically you saw from an incoming order rate standpoint?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. Orders overall were $912 million. Correct me, guys. I'm just doing it from memory. They were actually down a bit. They were down about 5%. However, we had some very large orders last year that were onetime orders. So when we normalized those orders and when you look at that to your organic growth on orders, it was up about 3%. So in the quarter, 3% organic growth on orders, 7% organic growth on sales.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then you mentioned targeting $90 million worth of cost reductions, $60 million from sourcing. One, can you sort of talk about where you're getting the other $30 million? And then this $90 million, if we were to subtract out the incremental investments you're making in growth, in R&D and what you typically incur from just a inflationary standpoint, is there still some net cost reduction left over?
Frank S. Hermance: Oh, yes, definitely. I mean, probably the best metrics that I can give you is that you also have to include pricing in this equation. And the metrics that we look at are that basically, in the budget for 2014, we have about 1.5% to 2% in terms of price, and we believe that the inflation that's going through the P&L is about a little bit less than 1%. So there's definitely incremental amount that is there. And then, as you indicated, the $90 million, there's about $60 million which is part of the material side of the business. But there's another $30 million -- and that is just the normal operational excellence initiatives, and it's really a large number of items, things that -- actually, I mentioned some of them in my opening talk. Value engineering is becoming more important to us. There's a movement of production to low-cost locales. We're going to move and have about $500 million of volume in our low-cost facilities in 2014, which is up from about $450 million in 2013. There's the normal types of synergies that we're going to get from the deals that I just talked about in answer to John's questions. There's international distribution consolidation that we are continuing to do not only with recent acquisitions but deals we did a number of years ago. So it's -- this is really a continual process for us. So when you roll all of that up, it's basically definitely we're getting sizable leverage. And it's obviously a balance between the growth investments, which are going to be the $40 million, the cost reductions, inflation and pricing that allows us to get the kind of earnings performance that we're talking about.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: So, Frank, you're rolling in about 4 deals now at EIG. I'm wondering if you could comment on what are the strains and gating factors on organizational capacity to absorb those. And also, how is EIG's pipeline looking?
Frank S. Hermance: In terms of any gates, the biggest issue is that as we're all aware, the pricing on some deals has definitely gone up. So we are prioritizing our deals to where the multiples we're paying are very reasonable so that when we bring the deals in and put our improvements in the deals, the returns are higher than our -- obviously our cost of capital. So that's the sort of the driver there. In terms of the deal backlog, it's quite good. We are working on other deals as we speak. It would not surprise me if you heard from us in a relative short future about another deal that we're going to close. And I think our ability to both source deals and also get them closed is a core competency of this company. And as I mentioned before, we are continually growing the talent so that we have the capacity to do deals. Right now, we believe we can do 10 to 12 deals a year. That's the infrastructure that we've put in place. We think it's the capability that we have intrinsic in the organization, and that essentially assumes we would not do 2 deals within a same -- the same subsegment of our business. Because then, the risk profile goes up. So we will spread them. Even if it's in the same, like for instance Power, they will be done in different parts of the Power business so that in essence, we're not increasing our risk as we bring those deals in.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And then on the organic growth outlook of 2% to 4%, I think your price approach is 2%. Sounds like BRIC's going to give you 1 point. You just did 7, and the comps don't get tougher for several quarters. So I'm wondering if maybe that's a little conservative or just to call that 1 quarter is too early to call a trend.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, 1 quarter is definitely too early to call a trend. And we're just taking a cautious outlook going into the year, and, hopefully, we'll be able to report better numbers as we go through the year. But basically, that 2% to 4% is what we have rolled up in our guidance.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Graham of Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Just wanted to ask about this $90 million maybe in a little bit of different way it was asked previously. I don't know if you're counting this differently because I remember you were saying at some point in the last 2 years that $60 million was the baseline target. And when things were -- the economy was better, that was the number; and when the economy was weaker, you pushed that number up. Or -- did you at that point not include acquisition cost takeout? Or is this $90 million just a big acceleration off of some of the value engineering [ph] and other things you talked about?
Frank S. Hermance: Now basically, Scott, we have included acquisitions continually in terms of providing that metric. I think the key answer to your question is that the company has just gotten larger so that there are more opportunities to take cost out. And we view this cost journey as a never-ending kind of activity that we expect our businesses every year, independent of where they are on the maturity curve, to be looking at cost improvements in their business. And the number is definitely larger, but I think if you stood it up aside the growth of the business, it's not that much different than what it has been historically on a percentage basis.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's fair. My next question is regarding the EIG margin. Could you tell us maybe specifically what the acquisition dilution to the margin was in the quarter and whether there were purchase accounting charges within that?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, the full dilution of the margin was on the order -- you've got it there, Kevin? What...
Kevin C. Coleman: Yes. It was around -- it was $50 million for -- 50 basis points for EIG.
Frank S. Hermance: 50 basis points for EIG.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And were there purchase accountings in there?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes.
Robert R. Mandos: Yes.
Kevin C. Coleman: Yes.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. I guess my last question would be the one that would -- somebody always asks, Frank. If you don't mind going through the divisional, it would be helpful.
Frank S. Hermance: Sure, Scott. I'd be glad to do that. So I'll start with the EIG. I don't think there's any real surprises here. For EIG aerospace, we had a very strong year. Sales were up mid-single digits, and that was driven by strength in commercial and our business in regional jet business. In the fourth quarter, EIG aerospace orders were up high single digits, and that, obviously, reflects the continued growth in commercial OEM build rates and also our success in winning content on new platforms. Looking to 2014, we expect continued solid growth for our EIG aerospace businesses. And again, that's based on the trends in the OEM build rates. Boeing and Airbus, the combination of those 2, are predicting they're going to be up about 6% in terms of deliveries. So that will obviously have an impact on our business. And we also expect solid growth in business in regional jets, but not so much from the market dynamics there as from the fact that we have won sizable content on a number of the newer aircraft. So when we sum all of that up for 2014, we're expecting organic growth in EIG aerospace to be up in that mid-single-digit arena. Moving to our Process businesses, the Process businesses had a super fourth quarter and also for the full year with really growth across most of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, overall sales were up high teens on a percentage basis with organic sales up high single digits. The core growth was broad based with particular strength in our Measurement and Calibration Technology and Advanced Measurement Technology divisions. And overall growth was obviously driven also by the contributions from the Controls Southeast and Creaform acquisitions. And for 2014, we expect our Process businesses to grow high single digits overall with organic growth of low to mid-single digits. And in response to one of the other questions, there might be a bit of conservatism in that organic growth rate for 2014. And we do expect balanced growth across most of our Process businesses in 2014. And then the last part of EIG is Power and Industrial. They had a solid fourth quarter with overall sales up high single digits. Growth was driven by mid-single-digit organic growth as well as the contribution from the acquisition of Powervar, which we discussed. And we view Power as a highly attractive growth area for us. With the acquisition of Powervar and Teseq, our overall Power business now is about $500 million in sales. And as a result of the acquisitions in 2014, we expect overall sales for Power and Industrial to be up over 30%. So very strong overall sales. And we're predicting organic growth to be up low to mid-single digits. So if you sum those 3 parts of EIG for all of 2014, we're estimating EIG total sales will be up low teens on a percentage basis with organic growth up low to mid-single digits. Moving to the other part of the company, in EMG, our differentiated EMG businesses had a strong fourth quarter. Sales were up mid-single digits in the quarter, really driven by broad-based strength, again, across most of the businesses in this subsegment. And for 2014, we expect our differentiated EMG businesses to be up low to mid-single digits. And the last part of our company, Floorcare and Specialty Motors, they just had a great fourth quarter and a great year. Sales were up mid-teens organically in the quarter, as I mentioned in response to one of the questions. And also, they were up very strong for the entire year, up -- I guess it was high single digits. So they had very, very good growth. And for 2014, we expect sales for this business -- we're saying up low single digits, and that's really based on a very high strength that we had in 2013. So if you sum those 2 for EMG, we're expecting overall growth of low to mid-single digits for EMG if you sum those 2 parts of the company. And that gets back to my overall guidance of the company being up high single digits overall with organic growth up about 2% to 4%, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason of Baird.
Robert W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Frank, I want to see if you could just circle back to aerospace real quick. The military portion of aerospace, I was just curious how that finished the year and what the planning assumptions embedded in aerospace are for military.
Frank S. Hermance: Excellent question. It's -- we had just a phenomenal quarter in the military segment. We're actually up mid-single digits organically for that part of the business. It was driven by the international part of our military segment, not the U.S. piece. But even the U.S. piece was not down sizably. So very strong performance. And what's included in my guidance in 2014 is for that business to be roughly flat. And that's the way we went into this year, assuming it was flat. Actually, I think we assumed it was going to be down a bit, and it turned out to be even better than that. So we're feeling pretty good in that this is not going to be a major drain on the company.
Robert W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, very good. And back to your geographic comment. I know you commented on the outlook for the BRIC regions. I was just going to see if you could flesh out the geographic outlook for '14 for the other major regions.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, we're saying basically the U.S. piece is going to be flattish. Europe, we think, is going to be up a little bit, maybe a little bit different than some of the large macro trends. And obviously, we think Asia is going to be the strongest part of this. And I'm speaking from an organic basis.
Robert W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Is there any particular portion of the business you'd call out in the U.S. that is working against you in '14?
Frank S. Hermance: Well, I would say, as you heard from -- what I just went over with Scott, the weakest piece we're going to say is the Floorcare and Specialty Motors part of the business, where we're saying it's only going to be up a low single digits. So that's probably the weakest. But it's also coming off a very, very strong year. So I think we're going to be back to a more normal trend with the Floorcare and Specialty Motors business than what we saw throughout all of 2013. But aside from that, the growth is fairly balanced in our budget. I look at our Process businesses, and you heard us speak throughout 2013 a lot about the oil and gas part of that business. And what's happening there is that with CapEx not sort of as strong as it has been in the oil and gas part of the business, that growth is coming down a little bit. But countering that, our other Process businesses are doing extremely well. So it's a much more balanced picture of what we saw in the fourth quarter and what we expect to see going into next year.
Operator: Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over for any closing remarks.

Frank S. Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a solid third quarter. We established quarterly records for sales and operating income. In addition, we ended the quarter with a record backlog of $1.2 billion. Orders in the third quarter were excellent at $937 million, up 7% organically from the prior year. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.05. Sales in the quarter were up 6% to $890 million. Organic sales were up 1% and in line with our expectations, while acquisitions added 5%, and currency was flat. Operating income for the third quarter was strong. It increased 9% to a record $204.7 million from $188.2 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our Operational Excellence activities. Operating income margin in the quarter was also strong at 23%, a 60-basis-point improvement over the third quarter of 2012. Net income was up 11% to $127.9 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.52 were up 11% over last year's third quarter. Operating working capital was 18.2% of sales in the quarter. During the quarter, we recognized an approximately $11 million gain on the sale of a facility. This gain was offset in the quarter by increased organic growth investments and higher-than-normal acquisition-related costs. I will provide some color on these increased growth investments in a moment, but let me first discuss results of the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very good third quarter. Sales were up 9% to $499.8 million on strength in our longer-cycle aerospace and oil and gas businesses, plus the contributions from the Micro-Poise and Controls Southeast acquisitions. We also saw strength in our Advanced Measurement Technology business. Organic sales were up 1%, acquisitions added 8%, while currency was flat. Orders for EIG were also very strong in the quarter, up 6% organically. EIG's operating income performance was excellent. Operating income increased 14% to a record $138.9 million, and operating margins were 27.8%, up 120 basis points over last year's third quarter. The Electromechanical Group also had a solid quarter. Sales were up 2% to $390.2 million on strength in our Precision Motion Control business and in our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business. Organic sales were up 1%, and foreign currency was a 1% tailwind. Organic orders were very strong, up 9% in the third quarter. EMG's operating income was $77.5 million, and operating margins were 19.9% in the quarter. Given the low-growth market environment, we felt it was prudent to redeploy a portion of the facility gain into targeted organic growth investments. These growth investments are incremental to the $35 million of growth investments we had previously targeted for the full year. The investments are focused on Global & Market Expansion and new product development initiatives and are being made in specific targeted projects in support of our growth strategies. I will provide some examples of a few incremental growth investments as part of the update on our 4 growth strategies, which are Global & Market Expansion, New Product Development, Operational Excellence, and Acquisitions. First, Global & Market Expansion. Global & Market Expansion continues to be a key driver for AMETEK's growth. In the third quarter, international sales represented 54% of our total sales, up from 52% of sales in the third quarter of 2012. The increase in international sales percentage was driven by strong Aerospace and Process sales. Our businesses have identified attractive Global & Market Expansion opportunities in service and aftermarket support for customers. A number of the growth projects undertaken in the third quarter were targeted at expanding our capability within these areas. Providing customers with high-quality service capabilities is increasingly being viewed as a key differentiator for our product sales, especially in China, India and Southeast Asia. In addition to driving incremental aftermarket service sales, adding service and application engineers in these regions will support our product sales efforts. Across our Process businesses, we initiated a number of service expansion projects in the quarter, including, within our Taylor Hobson, SPECTRO and oil and gas businesses. In our Programmable Power business, we are investing in a growth project focused on expanding and strengthening our sales channel capabilities and effectiveness. This project is focused in parts of Asia where we see excellent growth opportunities for our power supply solutions within attractive test and measurement markets. These markets include semiconductor and electric vehicles. The increased investments include additional sales and application engineering resources, increased training for our distribution partners and increased marketing spend. In addition to these incremental growth investments, we continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities. Now on to New Products. New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. And in 2013, we expect to spend $178 million, a 15% increase over 2012. A number of the incremental growth investments we made in the quarter were in new product development activities. As an example, within our Ultra Precision Technology business, we are making an incremental investment to enhance an existing surface measurement product to expand its market opportunity. The R&D investment will be used to increase the functionality, measurement capability and ease of use of the existing product while also reducing cost. The investment is being made in design and development, testing and production build-out. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 21% of sales in the third quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. Operational Excellence within AMETEK includes Lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, Design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts and the movement of production to low-cost locales. Operational Excellence also includes our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, where we continue to see excellent results. In addition to the significant success of our global material sourcing initiatives, we continue to generate excellent results from our overall MRO and e-procurement initiatives, as well as our value engineering activities. From these combined sourcing activities, we recognized approximately $16 million in savings in the third quarter and have recognized approximately $46 million in sourcing savings year-to-date. We continue to expect at least $100 million of total cost savings in 2013. Now turning to Acquisitions. We've had a solid year thus far in 2013 and had a very active third quarter with the acquisition of Controls Southeast during the quarter and the acquisition of Creaform, which was announced this morning. In addition, our pipeline of deals remains strong, so we expect to remain very active over the balance of 2013. Thus far in 2013, we deployed roughly $280 million in capital, acquiring approximately $100 million in revenue. I'll provide some more insight into the Creaform acquisition. Creaform is a leading developer and manufacturer of innovative 3D measurement technologies and services. They are the industry leader in stand-alone, portable 3D scanners. Creaform's optically based devices are used across a number of high-growth applications within the aerospace, automotive and general industrial markets. Key applications for their products include reverse engineering, dimensional inspection, precision manufacturing, nondestructive testing, automated quality control and 3D printing. Creaform is an outstanding acquisition for us and an excellent strategic fit with our Precision Technology -- Ultra Precision Technology division. Its products expand the range of our metrology product and technology offerings in a high-growth niche market in portable, noncontact metrology applications. Creaform was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $52 million. The price paid was approximately $120 million. The business is headquartered near Québec City, Canada. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially during periods of slow growth. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus, our backlog of deals remains excellent, our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of 2013. Our estimates for the balance of 2013 reflect the impact from the continued soft but slowly improving demand environment. We anticipate 2013 revenue to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2012. Organic growth is expected to be up low single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We expect our earnings to be approximately $2.09 per diluted share, up 11% from 2012. Very importantly, fourth quarter 2013 sales are expected to be up high single digits from last year's fourth quarter, with organic growth up mid-single digits on a percentage basis. We estimate our fourth quarter earnings to be approximately $0.54 per diluted share, up 10% over last year's fourth quarter. So in summary, our overall business has performed well in the third quarter. The core sales growth, Operational Excellence initiatives and strategic growth initiatives enabled us to deliver earnings at the high end of our guidance, against the backdrop of a continued soft demand environment. We remain well positioned for the remainder of 2013. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our record level of backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2013. Bob will now cover some of the financial deals -- details, and then we will be glad to take your questions. Bob?
Robert R. Mandos: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a very good quarter, with solid operating performance and strong growth on orders. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were up less than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost containment. General and administrative expenses were up 1.3% of sales, in line with last year's third quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29%. For 2013, we expect our tax rate to be at the low end of our prior full year estimate of 29% to 30%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.2% of sales in the third quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $16 million for the quarter. Full year 2013 capital expenditures are expected to be $60 million. Depreciation and amortization was $30 million for the quarter. 2013 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $118 million. Operating cash flow was $166 million in the third quarter, and free cash flow was $151 million, representing 118% of net income. For the first 9 months of 2013, operating cash flow was $451 million and free cash flow was $414 million, representing 109% of net income. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow to be approximately 113% of net income. Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we expended approximately $160 million in the quarter. Total debt was $1.3 billion at September 30, down $154 million from the 2012 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $255 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at September 30 of 26.3%, down from 33.8% at the end of 2012. At September 30, we had approximately $950 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Creaform. Capital deployed was approximately $120 million, which brings our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2013 to approximately $280 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had a strong third quarter, establishing record levels for sales and operating income. We're well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a very strong balance sheet and cash flows.
Kevin C. Coleman: Great. Thank you, Bob. Myra, now, happy to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: On -- Frank, on the $11 million, I guess, the gain on sale unit [ph], is there any way to quantify what in terms of that went to, I guess, the incremental growth investments?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure. Sure, Allison. Of that $11 million, approximately $7 million went to incremental growth initiatives, and the remaining $4 million was higher-than-normal acquisition-related costs. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have been very active in the acquisition environment, not only on the deals that we have already closed, but on other deals that we hope to close in the relatively near future. So if you look at what actually went through the P&L, about $5 million of acquisition-related costs went through the P&L, but we're saying that $4 million were incremental because we always have some residual level going through the P&L.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Got you. Perfect. And then can you just touch on EMG margins? They were a bit pressured this quarter. Was there something with mix there? Or I don't know, just elaborate what's going on there.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure, Allison. Yes, you're right, it was a mix issue. Our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business had a tremendous quarter. Their organic sales were up about 15%, and that was one of the drivers in the performance of EMG. And as I believe you're aware, the margins in Floorcare and Specialty Motors, although very good, are below the group average. So that mix shift is what drove that slight decrease in EMG margins.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Now should we assume that mix shift continued into Q4 to some extent?
Frank S. Hermance: I think you're going to find Q4 better. We are expecting good margins in Q4. We expect Floorcare and Specialty Motors to continue to do well, but we also expect the Differentiated businesses to do better. So therefore, maybe there'll be a slight mix shift but not of the same magnitude.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
Andrew Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: This is Drew Ronkowitz in for Nigel Coe. Just wanted to get a sense for what end markets were driving the order growth in the quarter and then how that's going to flow into your 4Q guidance.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. Great question. It really was across the board. If you look at the 5 sub-segments that we talk about, which are basically Aerospace and the Process businesses and Power and Industrial on the EIG side, and the Differentiated and the Floorcare and Specialty Motors sub-segments on the EMG side, all of those sub-segments had mid-single-digit or greater than mid-single-digit organic growth in orders. So it was a very, very encouraging sign for us to see that sort of broad-based improvement. Within each segment, the higher than sort of the mid-single-digit levels on the EIG side, were in Aerospace, where they were up in the low double digits, and in Floorcare -- or in the EMG segment, Floorcare was actually up organically, around 20%. So very, very strong performance, really, across the company and, in particular, in those 2 groups. So your follow-on point is, obviously, as we look to the fourth quarter, we're feeling very, very good about the organic growth of the company. And you can see sort of the progression of organic growth through the year. I think we started at about minus 2% in the first quarter, and then we went to flat, and now we're at 1%, and we're saying mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. So the trend is actually similar to what we laid out at the beginning of the year, maybe a little fourth-quarter-oriented than what we had expected, but the end result is excellent, and we feel good about the fourth quarter, and we also feel good going into next year as a result.
Andrew Ronkowitz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, if you could, on the Creaform acquisition, just give us a sense for the competitors in the space and then maybe the margin profile as it compares to the rest of the segment.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure. The margin profile is less -- a little bit less than AMETEK's margins, and we see opportunity to basically grow those margins as we do with most deals. The prime driver for this business, and why we acquired it, is that it has a very high organic growth rate. Over the last 5 years, it has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of about 20%. There are not a lot of what I would call direct competitors to Creaform in this 3D, portable noncontact metrology area. But in the broader sort of noncontact metrology area, competitors would be people like Hexagon, Nikon has some business here, FARO has some business here, so those are the type of competitors that you will see, although somewhat tangential to Creaform.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt McConnell with Citi Research.
Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a follow-up on that 20% organic growth. What's your expectation when you come up with your deal plan? When you model this out, what are you expecting over the next couple years or so?
Frank S. Hermance: We're expecting a low single -- low double-digit types of organic growth rates. We actually modeled it a bit lower than that to make sure we were paying a proper price for it, but I think that's the expectation. And obviously, that's on the high end of the businesses that we have. So we're pretty excited about this particular deal.
Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And switching gears a little bit, you've done great on the cost savings year-to-date, and I wonder whether growth investments were ever put on hold or maybe pushed out. That target has gone up a couple times this year as end markets look slow. So are you reinitiating any growth investments? Or is this facility gain really funding new projects?
Frank S. Hermance: No, it's definitely funding new projects. So we stated at the -- I think at the beginning of the year that we were putting $35 million in growth investments, and we have not, in any way, tailored that $35 million as we made other cost improvements. Our cost improvements were more focused on the materials side, on consolidation of facilities, things of that nature, not the key growth initiatives in the company. So this extra $7 million that I talked about in response to Allison's question is truly incremental to that $35 million. So we are now saying we are going to invest $42 million in growth investments during full 2013.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Graham with Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: One question for Bob and then 2 for you, Frank. Did the additional acquisition costs roll through the other line? Is that where we're seeing it?
Robert R. Mandos: Yes, Scott. That's where it rolled through. There was a piece that rolled through the other line, and there's also some that's above the line as well. But the majority of it flowed through the other line.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Got it. Frank, how was pricing in the quarter?
Frank S. Hermance: It was great. We're very pleased with pricing. It was up 1.8% in the quarter. And we look at a metric, as I think you're aware, Scott, of pricing minus total inflation in -- which includes salaries, materials, MRO activity, everything -- essentially everything. And that ratio of price minus cost was actually up about 0.8%. So in essence, that went to the bottom line. And obviously, there's other give-and-takes in terms of the growth investments, et cetera, but if you look at just the pricing minus inflation, that's the impact of it.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And is there any way to kind of parse out what pricing is? Is it kind of the same level in the order number?
Frank S. Hermance: I can't answer that off the top of my head. I would not expect any major difference, but I actually did not look at pricing in the orders that were coming in. We can -- usually, there isn't a major difference, but I really didn't look at it. We can get that information to you, Scott.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: But bottom line, is that with volumes apparently been down a little bit in the quarter, you're expecting that to reverse course in the fourth quarter?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, that's exactly right.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, could you just go through your typical 5-business unit sales, Frank?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure. Okay, we'll start with EIG. In Aerospace in EIG, the business really had an excellent quarter. Sales were up high single digits on a percentage basis, driven by continued strong performance in our commercial Aerospace business and from continued strength in our business and regional jet businesses. We remain really very well positioned to capitalize on the growing OEM build rates, increasing content on the next-generation aircraft and also the improving trends in the aerospace aftermarket. So for all of 2013, EIG Aerospace organic growth should be up mid-single digits. And as I mentioned, order growth in the quarter was up low double digits. So Aerospace looks solid going forward. Moving on to Process, our Process businesses also had a very strong quarter, with overall sales up mid-teens on a percentage basis, and organic sales were also strong, up mid-single digits. Organic growth in the quarter was driven by continued strength in oil and gas, which we have talked about for a number of quarters. And also, our Advanced Measurement Technology business had a strong solid quarter. Overall growth, well, obviously benefited from the Controls Southeast and Micro-Poise acquisitions. And for the full year, we expect our Process businesses to grow low double digits on a percentage basis, with overall organic growth up low single digits, maybe edging up to mid-single digits. Power and Industrial -- sales for Power and Industrial were down 10% on a percentage basis, on a difficult comparison to 2012. In 2012, we had a number of large Power and Industrial projects that went through the sales line, and therefore, this number is depressed based on that. And for all of 2013, we expect sales for Power and Industrial to be down mid-single digits. So if you sum those 3 parts of Aerospace for all -- or 3 parts of EIG, for all of EIG, we expect overall 2013 sales to be up mid-single digits, with organic growth up low single digits. And then, Scott, moving to the other part of the company, in EMG, the Differentiated businesses' overall sales were flat during the quarter from the prior year, we had solid growth in Precision Motion Control and third-party Aerospace MRO businesses, but it was offset by softness in our EMIP business. For all of 2013, we expect the Differentiated businesses to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, with approximately flat organic growth. And the last part of the company, Floorcare and Specialty Motors had a really great quarter. As I mentioned, their orders were up organically on -- about 20% basis, and overall sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the quarter. And this is driven by new program wins. It's not driven by an easy comparison, et cetera. It's really driven by new program wins. That team has done a superlative job in finding new business where not only we can grow the top line but also grow the bottom line. And for all of 2013, we expect sales for this business to be up mid-single digits. So if you sum those 2 parts of EMG for all of AMETEK, we're expecting mid-single-digit sales growth, with organic growth up just low single digits. But as I mentioned, the fourth quarter, we expect to be really good with overall sales up high single digits and organic growth up that mid-single-digit level. So, Scott, that's the company.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Frank, can you talk about the really strong orders in Aerospace? How does that breakdown as far as when you expect to deliver, is it a mix of some short-cycle, maybe, MRO, as well as longer-cycle, longer-term projects you're going to deliver in 2014?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, it's a combination of both, Mark. Orders were particularly strong in the business. In regional jet business, they were up mid-teens, actually, and most of that business is on the EIG side. Those shipments tend to be quicker than commercial aerospace. And the commercial aerospace orders were also strong, but that tends to be longer term. To your point, moving over to the EMG side of the business, we had good order growth in our third-party MRO business, and that tends to be, obviously, much shorter term. So it's a pretty good outlook for Aerospace, both on the short term and the long term. If you look at the backlogs at Boeing and Airbus, they're very, very strong. Boeing just had a great quarter. They're shipping at higher levels. They're -- this year, overall, Boeing is going to be up about 7% in OEM shipments, Airbus is going to be up about 5%, so roughly 6% in commercial aerospace looking at those 2 major providers. Business in regional jets, the market isn't as strong, but as I've mentioned on previous calls, we've won some major business, in particular with Gulfstream. So that, both in orders and in shipments, this is one of our highest growth areas right now. So we're really outpacing the market there. And the trends in third-party MRO seem to be on the improving side, so it's a really good outlook for Aerospace.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: And when you mix all that together, is there going to be a -- there's probably going to be a significant shift in margins in the Aerospace? I assume your MRO is more profitable than the OEMs, but if they're both growing, do you think the mix is going to be relatively stable?
Frank S. Hermance: Well, it depends on what part of the MRO business we're talking about. I was actually referring to the third-party MRO business that we have. And actually, our OEM margins are higher than the third-party MRO margins by a bit. If you look at our aftermarket business, in other words, products that we sell to the aftermarket that we also have the OEM business on, then you're right that, in essence, there is going to be a margin improvement. So I would expect, as we look forward, a bit of a market -- margin improvement but not as significant as your question suggests.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then finally, when you talk about strong oil and gas, can you go a little deeper. Just what products are particularly strong for you there, and are you talking more up-, mid-, downstream, what you're seeing in those markets?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. I think the best way that I could characterize it is that our upstream business is doing extremely well. It has done extremely well for an extended period of time. A major part of that business is outside the United States, about 70% is outside the United States, about 30% inside the United States, so we're enjoying the international growth aspects of the oil and gas business. Midstream is doing fine. It's not growing at the same rate, but it's doing fine. And then the downstream part of the business, which has lagged, is starting to show some life. So overall, when you look at the 3 segments, it's a very good picture, but it's clearly being driven by the upstream portion.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then finally, Bob, what were payables?
Robert R. Mandos: $331 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: On Creaform, can you talk about the multiple on the deal and sort of what you're seeing out there in terms of multiples in general? You talked about a pickup in activity, it seems like.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, Jamie, we paid approximately 10x EBITDA for this business, and that is a bit higher than we normally pay. But as I've already mentioned, this is a very high growth kind of business. So taking that into account, it's sort of a normal type of deal for AMETEK. In terms of your more general question, deal multiples have gone up a bit. They basically -- if I had to average it, they're probably up about 1 point from where they were 1 or 2 years ago. And what we're doing is parsing the deals that we're looking at, either to where we have more than the norm of synergies or more than the norm of organic growth. And with Creaform, it was clearly a growth picture. For CSI, the other deal we announced this year, it was more of a cost type of picture with high synergy. So that's the way we're viewing it, and thus, we're getting a very good internal rate of return on these businesses, good ROIC in year 3 and some accretion out of these businesses as well.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So does it seem a little bit tougher to get deals closer to the finish line, given the filter is a little bit more fine now from what you're looking at, given the multiples?
Frank S. Hermance: I would say maybe a little bit, but the other side of that is, our team, and as I think you may be aware, we have about 10 people throughout the company who are spending 100% of their time on deals and a large number of other people who are spending part time on deals. So many of our deals are coming from our internal efforts and tend to be more proprietary. And on those deals, I'd say there hasn't been any significant change. So there might be a slight impact, mainly due to the deals that come in from the investment banking community, but I'm pretty bullish right now on deals. We're as busy as we have ever been. So hopefully, we can close the deals that we have in the hopper. And if we can, we're not only going to have a very good year this year, we're also going to go in to next year with some sizable upward thrust due to those deals.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. And maybe, if you can, just talk through the geographic organic growth you sort of saw around the world and, given the strong orders, if there is any notable trends by geography as well.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I can give you the organic growth in sales. Basically, when we look around the world, the weakest part for us was actually the U.S., it was down about 4%. Asia was roughly flat. And Europe, surprisingly, I guess, was up about 4%. So when you average those, you'll get to that plus 1% organic growth for the company. And if you look at the detail underneath those numbers, I would say both the U.S. and Asia were just due to this somewhat lethargic return that we're seeing in the general economy. Our strength in Europe was driven by both our Aerospace and our Process businesses, where in our Process businesses, oil and gas, as we just recently talked about, is -- was very strong. And our Aerospace businesses are doing very well in Europe. So that's sort of the picture around the globe. When I step back and look at the whole sort of demand environment, I characterize it as a slowly improving demand environment. No question, it feels better today than it did 3 months ago, but somebody mentioned to me recently, "Oh, you're seeing a major uptick." And I would say, "That is not the case. It is not a major uptick, it is a slowly improving demand environment." The follow-up on your question of orders, we were actually pretty strong -- stronger in all of the regions, so orders were encouraging, and things are, in fact, picking up a bit. I don't have the numbers in my head for each area, but I do know that each geographic area was good on orders.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Frank, just 2 questions, maybe some follow-ups here on the Aerospace side. How did the military aerospace piece hold up, not just in the quarters but orders?
Frank S. Hermance: Okay. Military was strong. It was strong. It was low single digits. I'm saying that's strong in terms of organic growth because we had been running down a few points. So this quarter, we were actually up a few points on sales. And orders were roughly in that same magnitude. Actually, I think orders were a little bit better. Kevin is actually looking it up. Do you have it there, Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman: It's here, yes.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: So, okay, kind of a mid-single-digit level?
Frank S. Hermance: It was high single on orders.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That seems to be a pretty positive surprise for you...
Frank S. Hermance: Yes.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: As you head into the back part of this year.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Do you think that's -- as just a quick thought on '14 on the military aerospace side, is it just -- is flat a good assumption or should we be more cautious than that?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I think, with what I know right now, and we're just going into the budget season and one of the first businesses, actually, is our military business that we're going to take a look at. So barring the fact that I don't know exactly what they're going to say in that budget meeting, my gut is flat is a good assumption. Clearly, this business is not going to be down 5% or 10%, which was our fear maybe a year ago. But right now, I would say, flat is a reasonable assumption, and I'll update you in the call at the end of the first quarter as to exactly how we're feeling about the year.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Sure. And then in terms of Europe, again, I'm curious, Aerospace has been strong in Europe for the year. And is the obvious conclusion there that our Airbus exposure is kind of driving that strength?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, there's -- there are 2 parts to that. There's definitely our Airbus exposure, which has been very, very helpful. And now with winning new business on all of the major Airbus platforms, it's going to be very positive for AMETEK because we're going to be sort of agnostic as to whether Boeing is winning in the end market or Airbus is winning in the end market. In addition, though, our third-party MRO business there is doing very, very well. We've got a strong management team there. They have been winning share in that part of the world. And as a result, it's really the combination of those 2 things that is driving the strong European performance.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just the last question. At EMG, we touched on the margins there, the 19.9% margins. And again, I understand the mix of business today kind of maybe pressuring the margins a little bit. But what seems interesting here is that, with these new wins and the volume gains on the Floorcare side, I presume when the Differentiated businesses recover, that the margin potential of this segment will be higher.
Frank S. Hermance: No question, Richard. When we step back and look at the margin profile of the company, the differential in group margins is significant between EIG and EMG, and the potential is definitely in EMG. On the longer term, there's absolutely no reason that we can't raise the EMG margins to start approaching the EIG margins. And just the natural migration in EMG, where we're going to do deals and where we're going to put the majority of the investment is going to be on the Differentiated side. So as that Differentiated side of EMG first comes back, and then as we increase their volumes through acquisitions and organic growth investments, the margins on EMG are going to work in our favor. So in a way, this was a bit on an abnormal quarter, where the Floorcare and Specialty Motors part of the business just performed so well that it did have a bit of a slight deterioration on the margin impact in that business.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: But is the cost-driven Motors business, with these new wins and the volume that they bring and, obviously, a new market niche, I would think, if you just segment out the cost-driven Motors business, that the margins 1 year or 2 from now are going to be better than cost-driven margins were a couple years ago?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. I don't think there's any question about that. That, that is, in fact, a true statement that those numbers are going to improve because, there's no question, the margins on the new wins is much better than the base business. However, they are still not going to be at the level of the Differentiated businesses.
Operator: And the next question comes from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Frank, this is actually Joe Radigan on for Matt. In Process, are you still seeing orders drift to the right for the mid- and higher-end instrumentation that you sell? I'm assuming the funding environment there is still pretty challenging. And then maybe a second part to that, do you typically benefit from a year-end budget flush? Or what sort of visibility do you -- are you getting from your customers?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, that's a good question. I would say there is still a bit of a shift to the right. I would say it is not as significant as what we saw at the end of the third quarter, but I still detect some cautiousness with our customers. At the year-end, there are some of our businesses that, in their weekly reports, are definitely talking about customers that normally would take shipments in the fourth quarter are just being hesitant and trying to shift some to the first quarter. So to me, it just lines up with this slowly improving demand environment, that everybody is a bit cautious, it feels a bit better now than it did a quarter ago, but this is not an all-out let's go for the gold here. It just isn't -- it isn't that kind of environment. And I haven't heard anything when it comes to, specifically, budgets, but I think it's all wrapped up in that equation of a slowly growing economic environment.
Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the EMIP business, have you anniversary-ed the destocking that's been a headwind there? It seems like you've been calling off -- calling out softness there for some time now. Just can you just update us kind of on the situation in that business?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. No, that's been a disappointment to us. In fact, the destocking impact on that business has dragged on a bit longer than we expected, and that was a bit of a drag on our performance in the third quarter, and -- but it's definitely getting better. And I think it is going to cycle out as we get to the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. Just was more of a buildup because the OEMs had, really, take-or-pay contracts with many of the titanium producers. And as a result, they were forced to take the products when they didn't need it. For instance, when the 787 was grounded for a period of time, obviously, there was some backup in the supply chain. But I think it's getting better. I think we're going to see much better performance out of this unit next year. And so it's really -- I'm viewing it as upside from this point on.
Joseph K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, on the incremental growth investments, you talked about service opportunities. Can you just give a little more color there? Is this greenfield stuff or is it expanding the footprint that you already have? Just a little more on the aftermarket service side.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. I know, it's a great question. In general, this is service in areas where we are presently selling products and where service is particularly important to the customers. And that tends to be in Southeast Asia, China, that part of the world. And you can imagine, you put a high-end analytic instrument into a factory in the middle of China, and if it fails and they can't get a replacement product, they're going to have a problem with their output. And so what we are doing is putting more sales and service people in those geographic regions, a little bit in the U.S. but predominantly outside the U.S. And what that does is when something fails, they call our service people. We're there. We're there within a few hours or 24 hours, and we can get their plans back up. And that is highly valued. And it isn't just the fact that we get the revenue on that sales call, which is high, and the margins are good, it's very important for the next level of sales from those customers. There's going to be a strong bias to buy the products from people who have those service capabilities. So that's why we're putting that investment in. It's almost, from an economic return viewpoint, a no-brainer. It's just you can put the people in, they pay for themselves in a very short period of time, and it essentially helps the organic growth of the business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Andy Noorigian with Vertical Research.
Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Frank, I was wondering if you could touch on the Power and Industrial business a little bit more. Have you seen any signs in the heavy truck and off-road of inflection in orders or just underlying improvement in demand trends there?
Frank S. Hermance: Maybe a little bit of an upturn. And if you look at the market data in the North American market, which is the primary market that we serve, in 2013, the forecasts are about 244,000, if I remember the number correctly, in truck sales. But that's down about 9% to 11% over 2012. The market forecast for 2014 is actually up, it's up about 16%. Now that number does tend to fluctuate, but it does suggest market improvement next year. And I would say we're starting to see some of that right now.
Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Great. And then on the U.S., down 4%, I was wondering if anything in particular stood out that drove that. And has some of that softness continued into October?
Frank S. Hermance: I would say there was really no specific area in the company that I could point to. It was just general slowness in the U.S. So there was -- nothing that I can point to that says that's it, that that's the reason for that. And your second question was?
Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just how that's trended into October from the management perspective.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. I can't answer that question because I look at overall orders. I haven't looked at U.S. orders in particular. I mean, we're only a few weeks in, but, again, Kevin could get that data for you.
Operator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. Mr. Coleman, I'll turn the conference back to you. Please proceed with your presentation or closing remarks.
Kevin C. Coleman: Okay. Thank you so much, Myra. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. As a reminder, a replay of the call may be accessed at ametek.com and streetevents.com. And as always, I'm available today if anyone has follow-up questions. Well, thanks again.

Frank S. Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a very good second quarter. We established quarterly records for operating income, operating margins, net income and diluted earnings per share. In addition, we ended the quarter with a record backlog of over $1.1 billion. Orders in the second quarter were $895 million, up 2% organically from the prior year. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.02. Sales in the quarter were up 6% to $878.8 million. Organic sales were flat and in line with our expectations, while acquisitions added 6% and currency was flat. Operating income for the second quarter was very strong. It increased 10% to $202.6 million from $185 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our Operational Excellence activities. Operating income margin in the quarter was a record 23.1%, a 70 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2012. Net income was up 13% to $128.3 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.52 were up 11% over last year's second quarter. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow in the quarter was strong at $128 million, up 11% over last year's second quarter. Free cash flow was also strong at $117 million. Working capital management was excellent. Operating working capital was 17.9% of sales. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had an excellent second quarter. Sales were up 7% to $483.3 million, on strength in our longer cycle aerospace and oil and gas businesses, plus the contributions from the Micro-Poise acquisition. We also saw strength in our Measurement and Calibration Technology business and our Advanced Measurement Technology business. Organic sales were up 1 %, acquisitions added 7 %, while currency was down 1%. EIG's operating income performance was excellent, operating income increased 10% to $129.6 million and operating margins were strong at 26.8 %, up 80 basis points over last year's second quarter. The Electromechanical Group also had a solid quarter. Sales were up 6% to $395.5 million, on strength in our Floorcare and Specialty Motors business and the contribution from the acquisition of Dunkermotoren. Organic sales were flat, acquisitions added 6% and foreign currency was also flat. EMG's operating income increased 6% to $83.4 million and operating margins were 21.1%. Focusing now on our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Global and Market Expansion, new product development and acquisitions. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. Our results this quarter reflect the tremendous impact of our various Operational Excellence initiatives, as we were able to expand operating margins in the second quarter by 70 basis points to a record 23.1%. Operational Excellence within AMETEK includes lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts and the movement of production to low-cost locales. We also continue to see excellent results from our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. From these sourcing activities, we recognized approximately $16 million in savings in the second quarter. As a result of the weak global environment, we have increased our cost savings for 2013. We now expect approximately $100 million in total savings, up from the $95 million we targeted at the end of the first quarter. Global and Market Expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK's growth. In the second quarter, international sales represented 54% of our total sales, up from 50% of sales in the second quarter of 2012. The increase in international sales percentage was driven by strong growth in our process businesses and last year's acquisitions. Overall sales growth in the BRIC regions in the second quarter was very strong, up 21% over last year's second quarter. We continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprint in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities. In the second quarter, AMETEK's Process Instrument business was awarded a large contract for process analyzers at the Shah Gas Field in the U.A.E. The $4.6 million contract covers 26 AMETEK analyzers for the field software recovery unit, the largest complex of this kind ever built. The Shah Field was not previously developed because the gas has a high hydrogen sulfide concentration, making it especially challenging. We were selected because of our extensive experience worldwide in sulfur recovery, as well as our ability to meet the project's demanding schedule. Also in the second quarter, AMETEK's Power Systems & Instruments business was chosen by STX Heavy Industries, a South Korean-based EPC firm, to provide power supplies to support their ballast water management systems on both new and existing ships. Ballast water management systems are now increasingly being mandated for use on ships to provide a reliable and environmentally safe solution to properly chlorinate ballast water before discharge. We will be providing 40-kilowatt water-cooled high-frequency power supplies to STX for use in their electro-chlorination systems. New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. In 2013, we expect to spend $173 million, a 12% increase over 2012. We're excited about some recent new product introductions driven by these R&D efforts. AMETEK Solartron Metrology further extended the capabilities of their Orbit measurement system with the introduction of 2 noncontact laser probes. These high-accuracy measurement devices are specifically designed to support quality control in high-volume precision manufacturing applications. The addition of noncontact capability allows Solartron Metrology to meet the manufacturing requirements of smartphones and tablet computers that might be scratched by traditional touch probes. Within our programmable power business, we added 2 new benchtop products to our source in SG Series of DC power supply units. Our source in SG Series leads the industry in power density and is the most widely used DC power supply in its class, with more than 20,000 units in the field. The higher voltages and quality of power supplied by these benchtop units makes them well suited for a broad range of applications, including testing components for electric and hybrid vehicles, solar energy systems, semiconductor processing equipment, laser etching devices and the scanners used for airport security. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 21% of sales in the second quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. Now turning our attention to our 4 strategy of acquisitions. We announced the acquisition of Controls Southeast this morning, which closed after the end of the second quarter. Controls Southeast or CSI is the leader in custom engineered thermal management solutions used to maintain temperature control of liquids and gases in demanding process applications. Their thermal solutions are used across a wide product range of process industries, including oil and gas, petrochemicals, plastics and pharmaceuticals. CSI is a highly strategic and synergistic acquisition for our process and analytic instruments division. The combination of CSI's thermal management solutions with our process instruments analyzers and our recently acquired O'Brien gas and fluid handling systems, now allows us to provide our global customers with a more complete end-to-end process control solution. In addition, we can leverage our market leading position in the global sulfur analyzer market to better position CSI globally. CSI was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $50 million. The price paid was approximately $160 million. The business is headquartered in Pineville, North Carolina, just outside of Charlotte. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2013 as we see this -- as this strategy is a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially during periods of soft global growth. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our backlog of deals remains excellent, our balance sheet is strong and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. Turning to the outlook now for the remainder of 2013. Our estimates for the balance of 2013 reflect the impact from the continued soft and uncertain demand environment. We anticipate 2013 revenue to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2012. Organic growth is expected to be up low single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We expect our earnings to come in at the low end of our original guidance range of $2.08 to $2.12 per diluted share. Third quarter 2013 sales are expected to be up mid-single digits from last year's third quarter, with organic growth flat to up low single digits. We estimate our third quarter earnings to be approximately $0.51 to $0.52 per diluted share, up 9% to 11% over last year's third quarter. In summary, our overall business performed well in the second quarter. Our Operational Excellence initiatives and focus on strategic growth initiatives enabled us to deliver earnings in line with our guidance against the backdrop of a continued soft demand environment. We remain well positioned for the remainder of 2013. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our record level of backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2013. Bob will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be glad to answer your questions.
Robert R. Mandos: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid second quarter with very strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were up less than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost containment. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, below last year's second quarter level of 1.4% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.4 %, down from last year's second quarter rate of 30.8%. The lower tax rate in the quarter was the result of our ongoing international tax planning activities. For 2013, we expect our tax rate to be between 29% and 30%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.9% of sales in the second quarter, up slightly from last year's second quarter. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. Full year 2013 capital expenditures are expected to be $65 million. Depreciation and amortization was $29 million for the quarter. 2013 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $118 million. Our cash flow was excellent in the second quarter. Operating cash flow was $128 million, up 11% over last year's second quarter, and free cash flow was $117 million. For the first half of 2013, our operating cash flow was $285 million, up 11% from the first half of 2012. And free cash flow was $263 million, representing 104% of net income. We anticipate the full year free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income. Total debt was $1.24 billion at June 30, down $210 million from the 2012 year end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $208 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 27.3%, down from 33.8% at the end of 2012. At June 30, we had approximately $915 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we acquired Controls Southeast. Total capital deployed was approximately $160 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had a strong second quarter, establishing record levels of operating income, operating margins, net income and diluted earnings per share. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a very strong balance sheet and cash flows.
Kevin C. Coleman: Great. Thanks, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we're happy to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes of the line of Allison Poliniak using with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Frank, could you just touch on, obviously, a lower expected revenue growth for this year. I mean, is there a specific end market or region that we could be more concerned about, I guess, or what's changed?
Frank S. Hermance: I think the biggest change, and it probably isn't a change in the sense that the markets just remained tepid. And there's no specific area in the company, it's just that the second half is not quite as strong as we had originally anticipated. And that's why we lowered our guidance just a bit, because we're really reflecting that weaker environment. So we had hopes the second half would be a bit stronger.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, the BRIC regions, could you touch on it? Obviously, the nice growth there. There's -- certainly, there's concerns with macro challenges in Brazil and China. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there at this point?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. We've put some very sizable investments in those regions, Allison, and they're paying off for us. As you heard in my opening remarks, the BRIC countries were up over 20% in the first quarter. They were up nicely organically. And in particular, the BRIC countries outside of China were strong, with India, Brazil and Russia up sizeably. China was a bit tepid, but we're still pretty optimistic about the Chinese market. And although there are some macro concerns there, we're making investments and we still think it's going to be an excellent part of the world to continue to invest in. So overall, we're continuing to put investments in the BRIC countries and I think it's going to help our growth as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes of the line of John Baliotti with Janney Capital Markets.
John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Frank, the -- if my numbers are right, over the last 4 years or so, you've averaged about 150 basis point improvement in EIG. So I think the quarter, as you pointed out, was particularly strong, but it seems like the comps were certainly not in your favor and -- to continue to show improvement there. And it seems like with less growth there, are you finding more synergies than you originally expected, since as you pointed out, the growth was harder to come by this quarter than previously thought?
Frank S. Hermance: Absolutely. I mean, we have seen the growth, although it was a bit better in the second quarter versus the first quarter, we had seen -- we have seen the growth not quite at the level we would like, so we have put additional cost reductions into EIG, as well as EMG. And actually, we were quite pleased with the operating income margin performance that we saw with the 70 basis points improvement at the operating income line and in EIG, it was actually 80 basis points. And both margins were 26.8%, so very good margins. We're not going to be able, and we've talked about this previously, to continue raising the margins 100-plus basis points when you're running at those kinds of levels. But we do believe we can continue, and our guidance now is in the range of 50 to 60 basis points for the company this year at the operating income line. And although we haven't given guidance for next year, I think that's the kind of range that you could consider we would be in for next year.
John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Yes. And so to that point, what do you think that says about, without holding into a particular quarter or year when that -- when you see much more stable core growth? But what do you think -- let's focus on EIG, about future leverage in terms of the types of things you've been able to improve efficiency on in that segment?
Frank S. Hermance: We continue to think that there's leverage and there's 2 key points to the leverage. One is organic growth and EIG tends to have higher organic growth than EMG. The contribution margins in our businesses are well north of 35%. And particularly, in EIG, they're north of 40%. So for every dollar you do get in organic growth on the top line, you have a very high contribution margin to the bottom line, which is a positive impact on margins. The second element is we are continually looking to improve the operating efficiencies and the cost in our business. It's just ingrained in the blood of our operating managers, and we won't really accept the budget unless we see cost improvements. And there are additional things that we have been doing and will be doing in terms of plant consolidations, focusing on material. A lot of work in EIG on value engineering, which has really given us substantial cost improvements where we can go back and look at products and -- with minimal engineering, substantially improve the margins on those products. When you sum all of that up, some organic growth and continued cost improvements, we're pretty bullish about the operating performance of the company and we do see that we can continue to expand margins. John, just as a point, I did look at return on invested capital. And in the quarter, it was 12.9% versus 12.4% last year's second quarter. And I know you focus on that metric.
John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Yes. I was going to -- actually, that was something I was looking at. That's -- it's been -- that's part of the greatest improvement you've put up since the fourth quarter of 2011, and that's despite the fact that your cash was up 27 %, which is certainly a high-quality problem, but certainly didn't help your improvement in that metric.
Frank S. Hermance: Right. Yes, we're pleased with that, John.
Operator: Our next question comes of the line of Matt McConnell with Citi.
Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Could you give us a sense of the profitability on CSI and maybe price on the EV to EBITDA basis?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, the price that we paid was about 9x forward EBITDA. So this business has got a very good EBITDA profit margin associated with it, but it's actually still a bit below AMETEK. So we see sizeable synergy here, sizeable leverage to improve it more. So we think the price paid has been in line with our previous acquisitions. But the good thing about this particular deal is that we have more than the average amount of synergies with this product. They do a lot in sulfur recovery and we are very, very strong in our process businesses and sulfur recovery. In the instrument side, our market shares are on the order of 70%, 80%, 90%, depending on how you put the numbers together. So you put you these 2 businesses together, and they are a powerful combination where we can further extend our reach into sulfur recovery. So we're pretty excited about it, we think we paid a reasonable multiple and we think we're going to get a super return on invested capital on this deal.
Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then is there also an international expansion opportunity and could you talk about -- is CSI U.S.-centric or...
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, there is. The company itself is about 50% international. However, they have virtually no sales in the BRIC countries. And as we just talked in response to Allison's question, we have put substantial investments in the BRIC countries. And it's really an excellent question because that is part of the key synergies we see with this deal that they can -- we can drag them along, if you will, with our sulfur recovery efforts in the international and in the BRIC -- in particular, the BRIC environment. So we do see a sizable synergy there. We just counted it in a bit in our model. And as I mentioned, the return on invested capital on our model was excellent. So I think we have the opportunity to even do better than what is in our model, based on that sales synergy.
Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And then you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the pipeline is still fairly strong. So where are you seeing opportunities? Could there be more deals in 2013? And just give us a sense of what the M&A environment looks like in our [ph] view...
Frank S. Hermance: The M&A environment is okay. Our team has done a good job of filling the backlog of deals. We have a very aggressive and solid team here in the corporate office, which is augmented by our divisions. And they've done a really, really good job of working with companies and bringing some of these companies to the table without even having investment bankers involved, et cetera. So we feel pretty good about it. The first half, we obviously closed this one deal. We did have a couple of deals that we didn't consummate. And that's good for you guys and ladies because we found some problems with those deals. But I'm hoping and I would be disappointed, it may be another way of saying it, if we didn't have a solid second half in terms of acquired businesses. As Bob suggested, we have extremely good cash flow. We're estimating operating cash flow for the year, about $665 million, I think, was the last number I saw. We're going to spend about $65 million on CapEx, so we've got $600 million of free cash flow to basically deploy. And you couple that with our strong balance sheet and we're in great shape. And the key is to find good deals. It's easy to do acquisitions. It's not as easy to do good acquisitions. And we're very selective, we make sure there's synergy and we make sure they fit with our businesses. So as I say, I hope in the second half, you'll be hearing a lot from us.
Operator: On question comes of the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Frank, I think the 40% incremental margin expectation for EIG that you expected is maybe more pointedly above ranges you previously discussed, if I'm not mistaken. Can you just address if anything's inflecting there or what's shifting to drive that upward?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, Chris, you're probably referring to the point that I have talked about margins in the 35% -- contribution margins in the 35% or above region. When I was talking about that, it was for the full company. And the margins in EIG tend to be on the higher side. The margins in EMG tend to be a bit on the low side. So it really is not inconsistent with what we have been saying. It's -- the EIG businesses are very good. They've got high levels of differentiation. They tend to have a higher gross margins and they tend to have higher contribution margins as a result than the businesses that are in EMG.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then on the Controls Southeast, I know you've tied it in with O'Brien, but I think the thermal solutions is somewhat new. I'm just wondering what the breadth of bolt-on potential is related to that space, how fragmented is the industry, and if that's on the electric or steam heat?
Frank S. Hermance: It's a great question. This particular business is focused on the steam side. O'Brien is focused more in -- on the electric side. And the opportunity here is really, really good because this business, basically, one of the key core competencies is that they do complete thermal management solutions for either EPCs for the end customer or also in MRO-type of applications. So they will come in, they have proprietary software and technology that enables them to identify exactly what type of products need to be either in the sulfur process or in some other process to basically guarantee the temperature of the gases or liquids because you obviously don't want them to freeze. They're -- you get higher efficiency if they're held at the right temperatures, et cetera, and they are very, very strong in this niche. And the niche itself is relatively large, depending on how define it, it can be $3 million to $500 million. So we see that it's just a characteristic acquisition where basically, it's a niche. They've got great technology, highly differentiated and very little competition in that niche and therefore, you can make very high returns.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: So if you wouldn't mind, Frank, doing your typical unbundling of 5 [ph] business, what you saw on the quarter?
Frank S. Hermance: I'd be glad to do that, Scott. So let me start with the EIG, since there's been a lot of questions regarding EIG. And I'll start with the aerospace and EIG had a really strong quarter, driven by strong performance in our business and regional jet business. Sales were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis in the quarter. In the second half of the year, we expect solid growth for our commercial and business and regional jet businesses, given both our internal growth initiatives combined with positive trends in the OEM build rates. OEM build rates for Boeing and Airbus combined are expected to be up about 7% this year. For all of 2013, EIG aerospace core growth should be up approximately mid-single digits. Moving to our process businesses, they also had a solid quarter with overall sales up low double digits on a percentage basis. Organic sales were up low single digits. Overall, our growth in the quarter was driven by continued strength in our oil and gas business, combined with the contributions from the Micro-Poise acquisition, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. And our Measurement Technology -- Measurement and Calibration business and Advantage Measurement Technology businesses were also quite strong in the quarter. For the full year, we expect our process businesses to grow high single digits overall, with organic growth up low single digits. And the last part of EIG is Power and Industrial. Sales for Power and Industrial were down mid-single digits on a percentage basis, which was driven by continued weakness, as we expected, in the heavy truck and off-road market. For all of 2013, we expect sales for Power and Industrial to be down about mid-single digits, driven by weakness in the industrial businesses. So if you sum these 3 parts of EIG, for all of EIG, we expect overall 2013 sales to be up mid-single digits, with organic growth up low single digits. And we do expect some strengthening in organic growth over the second half of the year. Moving to the other part of the company, in EMG, I'll start with the differentiated businesses in EMG. They were up mid-single digits on a percentage basis in the quarter, driven by strength in our Precision Motion Control division, including the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition. Organic sales were down low single digits in the quarter, driven by weakness in our EMIP business and our North American MRO business. For all of 2013, we expect our differentiated businesses to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis, with overall organic growth approximately flat. Floorcare and Specialty Motors, our legacy business, had just a stupendous quarter. They performed very, very well. Sales were up 10% organically in the quarter and profit margins were excellent. This was driven by winning some business that I have talked about before, with in particular, one OEM, but also a second OEM has also been made or been acquired by us. So that for all of 2013, we now expect sales for Floorcare and Specialty Motors to be up mid-single digits. So if you sum these 2 parts of EMG, we are now expecting EMG to have overall growth mid-single digits in 2013 with organic growth of low single digits. And also, we do expect some strengthening in organic growth over the second half of the year. My final comment would be, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, if you sum what I said about EIG and EMG and look at AMETEK as a whole for 2013, we're expecting mid-single digit sales growth, with organic growth up low single digits.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: That's perfect. That's exactly what we're looking for. But if you don't mind, 2 questions do stem from that. Number one, the EMIP business has now been weak for several successive quarters, I was kind of wondering what your thoughts were on that business and what the cause is. And then secondly, third-party MRO North America sounded like it was down, maybe the why behind that as well.
Frank S. Hermance: Sure, Scott. The EMIP business, you're absolutely right. It has been weak the last few quarters. One of the drivers for that weakness is that we make master alloys, or components that are used for master alloys, that basically produce titanium that's used in the aerospace industry. And there was pent-up demand for that and basically buildup of inventory, I should say, rather than pent-up demand. It was really a buildup of inventory in that cycle. As you know, the 787 was delayed. And even irrespective of the 787, there were a lot of take-or-pay contracts from the aerospace OEMs that they had to take titanium when they really didn't need it. And that is just starting to bleed off at this point. So that's a dynamic in the marketplace that should improve. Secondly, a major part of this business is U.S.-focused and the U.S. economy has been weak, so there's just general weakness in that business. And we're forecasting that it will improve as we go through the second half and I think we will see improvement in that business. The second question you had was on the third-party MRO business and yes, you're absolutely right. That was weak in the second quarter. That weakness really stemmed, again, from the U.S. marketplace. The international portion of our MRO business was actually quite strong and did well, but there was weakness in the U.S. piece of the MRO business. And you may recall that many other companies in the first quarter spoke to weakness in their U.S.-based MRO businesses and I think we have just seen a delayed impact of that and we saw it in the second quarter. It was not as big an issue as EMIP was, but it did contribute to basically some of the slower growth in the EMG side of the business. And I can tell you, it's looking better. July was actually very strong in the U.S., which was surprising, given what we saw in the second quarter. So hopefully, we're sort of through the knee and this business will improve throughout the second half, Scott.
Operator: Our next question comes the line of Brian Langenberg with Langenberg & Company.
Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC: Two things, Frank. First of all, in oil and gas, if you could just dive a little bit deeper into what you're seeing as far as you have visibility between upstream, midstream and downstream. And then within oil and gas, a couple of companies are talking particularly about long cycle, which you alluded to. Talk to us about MRO within oil and gas and long cycle to the extent you have visibility. And I have a small follow-up.
Frank S. Hermance: Sure, Brian. In terms of oil and gas, it performed very strong in the second quarter and we're forecasting it to continue to be strong through the rest of the year. Obviously, the price of oil is one of the key drivers to the marketplace, in general. If you look at the international rig count, it's a bit off of its recent peak, but it's still at a very, very high level. So this is clearly a driver. In terms of your question between upstream, midstream and downstream, our strength is focused in the upstream area. We're seeing extremely good strength, both in the U.S. as well as internationally, in the upstream segment. The midstream segment is okay. It's actually improving a bit. The downstream area is the weakest of the business, but we're also feeling a little revitalization in the down -- in the downside of that business as well. So overall, a good picture, driven largely by upstream. In terms of your comment about long cycles, there's no question that this is a longer-cycle business. When AMETEK looks at its businesses, we characterize the -- basically, the oil and gas business along with our power business and more importantly, our aerospace businesses as the longer-cycle components. And you add all of them up and they are about 1/3 of our volume, but about 40% of the overall profitability of AMETEK. And the MRO business is okay. It tends to be more focused on the downstream side, and so my comments on the downstream side are probably more reflective of the MRO than the upstream area. But we expect that's going to continue to sort of improve as the year goes on, so I hope that's...
Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC: Great. Yes, that's very helpful. And then just one other question. With respect to the CSI acquisition, the way you talked about it, it seems to me that, that acquisition actually increases the value of your prior acquisition of O'Brien.
Frank S. Hermance: Absolutely.
Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC: And then my question, it's a nuance question, at the time you bought O'Brien, when you did that deal, were you thinking in terms of it works on the numbers as is, or was there a thought process to other things that you knew you would end up acquiring in due course, probably [ph] just play out [indiscernible].
Frank S. Hermance: That's an interesting debate internally when we do acquisitions. But our philosophy is, whenever you buy a business, basically, you've got to make that business stand on its own from a financial viewpoint. So when we did O'Brien, we looked at that on a standalone basis. We understood there were opportunities to add other businesses. And just as a point, the CSI business and O'Brien, both came out of the same private equity company, and there was even considerations within the private equity company of combining these 2 businesses before they sold them. But for whatever set of reasons, they decided to sell them sequentially. And when we looked at this business and we knew it was available, the seller IGP, who we've got a real good relationship with, I think, decided to go with us because they know that we know how to close deals and therefore, we can capitalize on that relationship and capitalize on putting these 2 businesses together. And obviously, we can employ synergies that a private equity firm would not be able to, all of my discussions around the sulfur recovery, et cetera.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Just a couple of questions. First, can you sort of talk about the cadence of incoming order rates as the second quarter progressed? So in looking at April to May to June and then what you've seen, I would imagine, you have at least a preliminary order number for July at this point for the company?
Frank S. Hermance: Sure, Matt. If we look at April, May and June, which is basically, obviously, the second quarter, the orders were basically flat through the quarter. There wasn't any major uptick at the end of the quarter. They were basically flat. July, surprisingly, came in strong. And it wasn't just on orders, it was on shipments as well. So we were very, very pleased with July, both from a orders and sales viewpoint, but also from a profitability viewpoint. One month does not make a trend in terms of an upward tick. But we were surely delighted with what we saw in July and hope that, that continues throughout the rest of the quarter and throughout quarter 4.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I know you mentioned BRIC earlier. Can you put some geographic color behind what you just said beyond BRIC?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I can put some geographic color on this. And you're probably going to be a little bit surprised by the numbers that I talk about. So if you look at our -- I'll take organic growth, which is probably the most applicable to your question. And in the second quarter, organically, we were flat on sales. And if you look at the disbursement around the globe, we were down about 4% in the U.S. organically. And there was no specific area for that, it was just general weakness, I would say, in the U.S. marketplace. Surprisingly, Asia was actually down a bit organically as well, but that was mainly due to some very tough comparisons that we had in Asia. We have booked some very large, we had some strong business in our UPT business. And so there was definitely an impact due to that. Another factor in there was Fukushima, because we had really spiked up our shipments last year. So that organic growth, although a low number, is probably not a good indicator of the future organic growth of Asia. And then, the part that I think might surprise you is that Europe was actually up about 5% organically. And that was really driven by our oil and gas businesses, which were very, very strong. We do roll up the Middle East and Russia and the former stan states into our Europe, if you will, and they were strong. And we also had some very strong shipments of our ORTEC products to Abu Dhabi, actually. And they also contributed to the strong performance in Europe. So that's the picture of what happened in the second quarter. I think as we go forward on more normal trend, we'd probably make sense and that's what we forecasted where if you look at the growth, the growth will be the highest in Asia, the U.S. will be in the middle and Europe will be the weakest. And so that's our thought process going forward.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then just lastly, price realization, second quarter, year-over-year?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. Price realization was 1.5% in the second quarter. Just an extension of your question, we roll up everything in terms of cost inflation on the input side, not just material, but labor, everything. And the net result of profit minus inflation, if you will -- actually, the pricing minus inflation, was about 0.6% in the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Frank, could you just walk through the pieces of the aerospace business? I think you spoke to the MRO business, the third-party MRO business. But could you just walk through those 4 pieces again and just kind of reflect against the total aerospace growth rate in core?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. If you look at all of aerospace, it was actually on sale, slightly negative in the quarter. The sale -- or excuse me, the order growth was actually very, very good. It was up sort of mid-single digits. And the other areas, the EIG portion, which is largely the commercial aerospace portion, was strong. That was up mid-single digits. The third-party MRO, we've already talked about. Business in regional jet was quite strong. The weakness really came out of the military segment, which is about 35% of the business and that was down 2% or 3% organically. So there was some mixed results in the quarter, but we were very optimistic because of the order incoming rate. And as we go forward, we expect this business to be up overall in the mid-single digit region on the sales line.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: For '13 that you're seeing, or for the second half or for '13?
Frank S. Hermance: It will be both. It would be both.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And just -- it's interesting, the military business, I think, you had cautioned about that very early in the year when sequester is just what's going on with the military budgets. Is that -- a number of 2 things, it is that primarily a U.S. business? And then secondly, again, are we seeing that impact and should we kind of expect the military aerospace business to be down low single digits here into the future for the next maybe 4 quarters?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. Well, first of all, it's 50-50. About half of our military business is U.S.-based and about half of it is outside the United States. In terms of our projections, you're right on. We are forecasting this to be down a few points. But that's much better than we had thought it was going to be. When sequester initially happened, we were really thinking this business could be down mid to high single digits organically. And the fact that it's just down 1 point or 2 is actually good news for us. And in discussions with this operating team, we don't see that changing for the next few quarters, so I think it's going to stay in that region. It's not going to be -- it's obviously a deterrent to the overall goal, but it's not going to be what I would consider a major problem to AMETEK.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just lastly, as I look at the second half of the year and I look at the 2 pieces of the business, EIG and EMG, again, the expectation for all of '13 is that core growth in both pieces or segments of the business is plus low single digit. And given how the first half played out, it would basically appear that maybe the growth in EMG might slightly exceed EIG for the second half? Is that just a comparison issue or is that rounding?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, slightly, you're right. The key to the organic growth in second half of the year, Richard, is actually the fourth quarter. And we have an easier comparison in the fourth quarter, plus the normal cyclicality of our business is to have a stronger fourth quarter in terms of total sales. And actually, we went through some numbers yesterday and about half of our anticipated growth in the fourth quarter is due to an easier comparison and about half is due to a tick up in sales. So when you sum that very strong fourth quarter organically, that's how you can get to this low single digit number. In terms of -- let me just look here between EMG and EIG, and -- let's see, in the third quarter, we still have EIG a bit stronger. But you're right, in the fourth quarter, EMG is stronger.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay, okay.
Frank S. Hermance: Okay. Does that help?
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: I know we're rounding your very low numbers but nevertheless, it does help.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Just quickly, what were payables?
Robert R. Mandos: $332 million.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: $332 million. Okay, great. And what's the acquisition -- it seems like a great fit, Frank, for the Process group. What are you expecting as far as annual accretion?
Frank S. Hermance: We don't expect any significant accretion this year, mainly because we have some acquisition-related expenses that are associated with this business. But as we go into next year, there's a couple of pennies here of accretion, that's about the magnitude. That's probably conservative, but that's basically what we have in our model.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. It sounds pretty conservative. Okay. Now what's your current capacity for M&A? And then how much more debt could you layer on to be in your comfortable -- your comfort range for net...
Robert R. Mandos: Cash and existing facilities is about $950 million.
Frank S. Hermance: Right. But I mean, our debt to EBITDA is 1.36. Our covenants are at 3. We could easily lever up to -- 2.4 and 2.5 and keep investment grade. So the bottom line is we are not cash strapped in any way to do deals. It really comes down to finding good deals. We've got plenty of capital to do the acquisitions piece of the strategy.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Yes, I wasn't concerned that you didn't have capital since like you have a lot of capital. I'm just trying to frame how much...
Frank S. Hermance: Right, it's available.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: How much you would have maybe in the next 12 to 18 months in order to continue to accelerate your [indiscernible] valuation to get a little more reasonable?
Robert R. Mandos: Probably we can go between $1 billion and $1.5 billion when you lookay at our free cash flow.
Frank S. Hermance: I would say $1 billion, $1.5 billion.
Operator: Our next question as a follow-up question from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Frank, you almost answered the -- one of my 2 questions. The purchase accounting charges in the third quarter, is there an expectation for that?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, absolutely. And as you know, we don't strike those out, as most companies do. But there is at least $0.005, I would say, that may have flipped our estimates up 1 point higher, $0.01 higher if we had spiked it out. But we typically don't spike it out, as you know.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: Yes. And then secondly, if you wouldn't mind, to the extent that you're able, the second half, the pipeline for M&A, you sounded pretty optimistic about being able to close possibly multiple deals. Could you maybe size what you're looking at a little bit? And obviously, these things come and go often. But is there anything maybe a little bit outsized versus what we -- versus let's say, the one you announced today? Just maybe just give us a little bit of a framework for what is in the pipe, size wise.
Frank S. Hermance: Difficult question, Scott. And I'm sure you knew it when you asked it. But we do have a wide range of deals in the pipeline, all the way from smaller deals like this one of $30 million to $50 million in sales, up to deals we're looking at that are $200 million, $300 million, even $400 million in sales. And as you say, the pipeline, it changes, deals come, deals go. And what I can tell is we're very focused on the deals. Actually, the executive team here be meets every Thursday at 5:00 and that meeting is solely focused on acquisition pipeline and where we are and what deals are we bidding on, et cetera. So it's a wide range, it's in various different segments of the business. It's not in any once segment. There are substantial numbers of deals in process. There are some in the Power business and aerospace and some in the Electromechanical side of the business as well. So there's no way that I can really tell you or give you any guidance as to what we're actually going to close and where it is and how big because I honestly don't know. So that's not very helpful, but those are the facts.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies LLC, Research Division: No, I wasn't asking that. It just sounded like you were optimistic on closing 1, 2 or more? That's just essentially the tone that I read from you.
Frank S. Hermance: I think the tone is right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Noorigian with Vertical Research.
Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Just a quick question. I was wondering how Dunkermotoren and Micro-Poise did kind of on a standalone basis? I mean, how those are kind of comparing to your acquisition cases? And also as they roll into organic growth there, are they going to be organic growth positive, negative as we look at the back half?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. No, I would say that both of those deals are doing well for us. Micro-Poise is pretty much on the model, Dunker is a bit behind. But we're pretty optimistic that as we go forward, we're going to get good growth out of both of these and organically, they will be up as they sort of roll over on their annual or anniversary dates. So they'll be helpful to the overall organic growth of the company.
Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. On the point you made about the U.S. organic growth being down about 4 points, is there any way you can flush that a little bit more? Was that the military aero, or is there something else going on in there?
Frank S. Hermance: Actually, it's interesting because I looked at that this morning in anticipation of this question and it was just broad-based. There's no single thing that I can point to and say this part of the business or that part of the business was the issue. I mean, there was some softness in our industrial business, that I talked about in the -- in my opening remarks. So that was there, but that wasn't the prime driver to the U.S. business being down. It was just general weakness. It's not the greatest environment, as we all know, in the U.S. and hopefully, it's going to get better as we go forward.
Operator: And there are presently no further questions at this time.
Kevin C. Coleman: Great. Thanks, Allana. Thanks, everyone, for joining our conference call. As a reminder, a replay of the call may be accessed on the Internet at ametek.com and at streetevents.com. And as always, if there's any further questions, I can be reached at (610) 889-5247. Thanks so much.

Frank S. Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had a solid first quarter. We established quarterly records for sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. Sales in the quarter were up 7% to $882.9 million, organic sales declined 2%, while acquisitions added 9% and currency was flat. Operating income for the first quarter increased 8% to $197.2 million from $182.8 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our Operational Excellence activities. Operating income margin in the quarter was 22.3%, a 20 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2012. Net income was up 14% to $125 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.51 were up 13% over last year's first quarter. Included in our first quarter 2013 results are approximately $0.01 per diluted share in realignment cost and approximately $0.01 per diluted share in cost related to the performance-based accelerated vesting of restricted stock. As a result of the continued weak global environment, we determined it was prudent to take additional cost reduction actions in the first half of the year; the first quarter charge reflects these actions. We expect to see the majority of the benefits from these actions in the second half of 2013. The performance-based vesting occurred as a result of the stock price doubling in less than 3 years, reflecting the significant value created for AMETEK shareholders. If we adjust the earnings for both of these changes, the first quarter 2013 earnings would have been $0.53 per diluted share, up 18% over the same period last year. Orders in the first quarter were $878 million, up 2% overall from the prior year on a difficult comparison. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1. Cash flow was excellent. Operating cash flow was $157 million, up 11% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $146 million or 117% of net income. Working capital management was excellent. Operating working capital was 17.6% of sales. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a very solid first quarter. Sales were up 3% to $484.5 million, on strength in our longer cycle Aerospace and oil and gas businesses, plus the contributions from the Micro-Poise acquisition. Organic sales were down 2%, while currency was flat. EIG's operating income increased 7% to $131.7 million, and operating margins were very strong at 27.2%, up 100 basis points over last year's first quarter. The Electromechanical Group also had a solid quarter. Sales were up 11% to a record $398.4 million, on strength in our third-party Aerospace MRO business and the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition. Organic sales were down 3%, acquisitions added 14% and foreign currency was flat. EMG's operating income increased 10% to $78 million, and operating margins were 19.6%. Excluding the impact of the Dunkermotoren acquisition, EMG's operating margins would have been 20.3%, up 50 basis points over the first quarter of 2012. Focusing now on our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and acquisitions. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. Operational Excellence has many facets within our company, including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back-office operations, design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurements and the movement of production to low-cost locales. At the beginning of the year, we targeted $85 million in total cost savings through our various Operational Excellence initiatives. As a result of our global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives to date and the additional cost reduction actions we are taking, we are now targeting $95 million of cost savings in 2013. In the first quarter, our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives recognized approximately $14 million in savings, exceeding our target for the quarter. Given the continued strong effort by our management teams and employees in this area, we now expect approximately $54 million in savings for all of 2013, up from the $50 million we targeted at the beginning of the year. Moving to our second strategy. Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK's growth. In the first quarter of 2013, international sales represented 55% of our total sales. This was up from 51% of sales in the first quarter of 2012 and represents our highest-ever percentage of international sales. The increase in international sales percentage was driven by strong growth in our European commercial and third-party MRO Aerospace businesses and the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition. Overall, sales growth in the BRICS regions in the first quarter was very strong, up 18% over last year's first quarter, with especially strong growth in China. We continue to make investments to develop and expand our global sales channels, service capabilities and manufacturing footprints in order to position our businesses to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities. Our Power Instruments business has expanded its international growth opportunities with the development of transient power recorders that are compliant with IEC communications standards for electric substation automation equipment. Along with these IEC-compliant devices, we've increased our direct sales representation and entered into a number of strategic alliances to further extend our international market reach. In the first quarter, Power Instruments successfully secured a number of new wins worth approximately $3.5 million for their transient recorders in the Middle East. Additional opportunities are expected given our increased investments in that region. Moving to our third strategy. New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We've consistently invested in RD&E. In 2013, we expect to spend $173 million, a 12% increase over 2012. We're excited about some recent new product introductions driven by our RD&E efforts. SPECTROSCOUT, the latest ED-XRF elemental analyzer from SPECTRO Analytical Instruments, was officially unveiled in March at the Pittcon Conference. This compact portable instrument represents a major step forward for end users. The versatile instrument is able to perform rapid laboratory-class elemental analysis in the field or at remote locations. The SPECTROSCOUT is light enough to be carried and yet has as much analytical power as a top-grade benchtop laboratory analyzer. It's the ideal tool for environmental and geological field analysis and for highly accurate on-site precious metal analysis. AMETEK's Process Instrument business recently introduced the Thermox WDG-V Combustion Analyzer for measuring oxygen, combustibles and methane levels in flue gas. This product is the fifth-generation combustion efficiency gas analyzer from Thermox, building upon a long history of over 30,000 products installed in the field. It offers a reliable cost-effective solution for lowering NOx, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions; reducing excess oxygen; and improving operating efficiency for customers in refineries, power plants and chemical plants. Along with maximizing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions, the WDG-V Combustion Analyzer is designed to play an increasingly important role in plant control and safety, while reducing the risk of an uncontrolled combustion event. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 22% of sales in the first quarter, up from 19% the prior year, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. On our fourth strategy of acquisitions, AMETEK had a very strong year of acquisitions in 2012, deploying nearly $750 million in capital and acquiring 7 businesses with approximately $400 billion in annual revenue. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2013, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our backlog of deals remains excellent, our balance sheet is strong and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. Turning to the outlook now for the remainder of 2013. We anticipate 2013 revenue to be up high single digits on a percentage basis from 2012. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. We expect stronger organic growth in the second half of the year. Earnings for 2013 are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.12 per diluted share, up 11% to 13% over 2012. We raise the low end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. Second quarter 2013 sales are expected to be up mid to high single digits from last year's second quarter, with organic growth flat to up low single digits, reflecting the existing soft demand environment. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.51 to $0.52 per diluted share, up 9% to 11% over last year's second quarter. So in summary, we delivered strong results in the quarter and are well positioned for the remainder of 2013. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. Our excellent backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven Operational Excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2013. I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous effort and contributions from all of our management teams and employees, to thank them for their hard work and dedication. Our success has been and will continue to be a direct result of their efforts. Bob Mandos will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bob?
Robert R. Mandos: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a solid first quarter, with very strong operating performance. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were up less than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost containment. General and administrative expenses were 1.4% of sales, slightly above last year's first quarter level of 1.3% of sales, driven by the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in this year's first quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.1%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 31.9%. As we had expected, the lower tax rate in the quarter was a result of the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, as well as our ongoing international tax activities. For 2013, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 30%. As we've said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.6% of sales in the first quarter compared to 17.7% for the full year 2012. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. Full year 2013 capital expenditures are expected to be $65 million. Depreciation and amortization was $29 million for the quarter. 2013 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $118 million. Our cash flow was excellent in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was $157 million, up 11% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $146 million for the first quarter, representing 117% of net income. Total debt was $1.32 billion at March 31, down $130 million from the 2012 yearend. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $177 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at March 31 of 30.4%, down from 33.8% at the end of 2012. At March 31, we had approximately $840 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had a strong first quarter, establishing record levels of sales, operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.
Kevin C. Coleman: Great, thank you, Bob. Frank, we're we are now ready for to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So revenue in Q1, a little later than you were anticipating when we talked last. Was there a specific end market or region that came in a little bit later than you were thinking at this point?
Frank S. Hermance: No, I would say it was fairly broad-based, Allison. Things were just a little weaker, as most industrial companies are in fact reporting. So that's one of the reasons that we took the increased cost reduction activities in the quarter.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And then obviously Boeing, the 787, I know it's a small component for you guys, but any impact from that, and how should we think about that for the year?
Frank S. Hermance: No, really. There's very minor, if any, impact from the 878. As I think you're aware, we fly on most of the commercial aircraft that fly today. No one platform is a sizable impact to AMETEK. And actually, Boeing kept the production of the 787 going, enduring their few months of difficulties. So even if it did have a more sizable impact on our volume, you wouldn't have seen it for that reason. So really -- Boeing released earnings yesterday. They had a great quarter, and I think they're going to have a great year. Matter of fact, if you look at commercial aerospace overall, they're forecasting production rates to be up about 7% this year, with Boeing up about 8% and Airbus up about 5%. So we're seeing some really good tailwinds, if you will, from commercial aerospace.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Great. And then on sort of the second half core improvement, is that mainly due to comparisons, or is there real core volume improvement that you're expecting at the end of the year?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, it is, no question, largely due to easier comparisons. Our first quarter is one of our toughest comparisons of the year. So we expect that the as we go through the year, we're going to see that improved organic growth due to the easier comparisons. But I think the key here is that we have significant confidence in our yearend EPS guidance. We've taken a little bit of additional cost reduction activities, as I mentioned, and we feel very well positioned throughout the remainder of the year, even if volume comes in a little bit on the short side, as we saw in the first quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just a little further to the second half bridge, I got the comparisons, it still looks like some materially higher sales run rate versus the second half -- I mean, versus the first half. Frank, if you could kind of comment on that observation?
Frank S. Hermance: It's just a bit up. It's not sizably up. It's just a few points higher in terms of the overall top line. So we're -- as I mentioned, we're pretty comfortable with the bottom line, and even if the top line comes in a bit softer, we feel the bottom line is going to be secure.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay, is there a visibility to some project letting that's been deferred in the near term?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, there's no question that there have been some projects deferred in particularly our Process businesses, and we're starting to see activity in terms of some of those projects being released, so that is definitely encouraging to us. Aerospace, if you look at the projected build rates for 2014 over 2013, they're projected to be up. And we lead that by about 6 months, so we would expect strength in the second half of the year in Aerospace. So we feel our estimates are reasonably conservative, given a few of those positive factors that we're seeing.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And then just a question on the tax rate. With 55% international, your tax rate compares a little high. Do you consistently repatriate cash, or is there a longer-term opportunity to drive that down?
Robert R. Mandos: Well, the tax rate was 29.1%. And do we consistently repatriate? Not really. I mean, we do enough to -- we actually prefer to keep our cash offshore for acquisitions. So we do just a small amount on a consistent basis.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: And longer-term opportunity to have that comparable to some others with half your sales outside the U.S.?
Robert R. Mandos: Yes, for sure. I mean, we've done a lot of things over the last several years. And actually, if you look at our tax rate from the beginning of last year to where we are now, you can see there was a consistent decline. So our initiatives there are really providing some significant benefit, and we view that as a positive going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from Jeffreys.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: The first question is for Bob. Bob, could you split the charges -- the 2 charges by segment and corporate force on a pre-tax basis?
Robert R. Mandos: In large part, it's all -- when you look at the charge, it's largely in the operating side of the segments. And when you look at the restricted stock, it's a little bit less than a 50-50 split.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I don't understand the first part of your answer.
Robert R. Mandos: The charge for the cost realignment?
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Yes.
Robert R. Mandos: That would be in the operating segments rather than general and administrative expenses.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Right. But I'm asking for the split between the segments.
Frank S. Hermance: Oh, okay. It's -- I got those numbers. It's $2.2 million in EMG and $1.2 million in EIG. And the second one, on the restricted shares advanced issue that we talked about, basically, if you look at how that's broken out, it's roughly $0.6 million in EMG; it's about $1 million in EIG; and about $1.1 million below the line, G&A for that.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Yes, yes. I guess, the other question is on the realignment. That's different than your normal fare, I assume, that's why you're calling it out because typically, Frank, you guys incur expenses pretty much every quarter to lower costs and for productivity, so this is a little different than that, right?
Frank S. Hermance: Just a little bit in the sense that normally, after first quarter results, we're not looking to do additional cost reduction activities. And in this case, because of that weaker top line, we decided to do that. So that's the only reason that we're calling it out. And there are sizable other costs that flow through the P&L all the time. And you may have noticed in our release, we're not really calling it adjusted earnings. We like to take those charges as they come and not really look at it from an adjusted earnings viewpoint.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Right. The charges are within the guidance. I get it.
Frank S. Hermance: That's exactly right.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Can you to tell us what the core orders were in the quarter?
Frank S. Hermance: Core orders were down about 5%, and that was against a very difficult comparison. As I mentioned, Q1 was very strong last year.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. The last question is really on the acquisitions. So we have the 3 big ones in particular from last year, and I was just wondering, on the integration side, with those things expected to be accretive, I'm sure, internally, how are those integrations going? Is there any way you can quantify for us the degree of accretion that we should see from those in 2013, if you're willing to do that?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. We just had updates, actually, on all of the acquisitions that we did last year, and the acquisitions are meeting the targets that we had set. So we're pretty comfortable with where we are. We typically don't give guidance in terms of the accretion from each of those deals, but what I can say is, they've met the objectives that we've outlined.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Frank, can you talk about kind of the linearity you experienced over the quarter from January, February, March, and kind of what the early read is on April in terms of what you saw for incoming orders?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. It was essentially flat. If you look at it, January, February and March were essentially similar. I would say that March is normally a bit higher. So if you looked at it with respect to that comparison, you could say that it was weaker, but not in absolute -- in an absolute sense. And somewhat surprisingly, I would say, and as other companies in the industrial space have indicated, April looks good. So there just seem to be a bit of a slowdown, I would say, at the end of March. Some of it may be related to the fact that the Easter holiday was right at the end of March, and -- although it's different to put any quantification around that.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then, Frank, can you talk about, specifically in the Process group of businesses, a little more granularity on end market trends and what -- where you see relative strength, where you're seeing the more pronounced weakness?
Frank S. Hermance: Sure. In the Process businesses, oil and gas is clearly the strongest part of that business. It has been growing consistently now for a multitude of quarters, and it continues to do that. Order trends are good; it looks quite positive. Some of the other parts of the Process business, in particular, some of our metal analysis businesses, those businesses are weaker than -- clearly, than the oil and gas business. Overall, the business is doing fine. The margins are incredibly good. But there is a mixture between certain parts of the Process segment, as I've indicated.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then just one last one, Frank. Can you sort of talk about the magnitude of relief, maybe, you're experiencing in terms of input costs, and then what you're seeing in the price environment?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. Basically, in the first quarter, we had about 1.5 points of price. And when you look at price minus inflation, and that's not just material, that's all inflation, including labor inflation, et cetera, et cetera, that was about 0.5 point. So in essence, pricing minus inflation was about 0.5 point.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Baliotti from Janney Capital Markets.
John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Frank, could you go through -- just give us some color on the subsegments within EIG and EMG, how the sub-businesses performed?
Frank S. Hermance: Sure, I'd be glad to do that, John. So why don't we start with EIG, and I'll start with EIG Aerospace. They had a very strong order on continued strength than our commercial business, as well as the business in regional jet business. Sales were up low double digits on a percentage basis in the quarter. And we expect continued solid growth for both the commercial and the business in regional jet side of that business. And on the business of regional jet side, it's more due to our internal growth initiatives than it is general market. On the commercial business side, the general market obviously is quite positive right now. So for all of 2013, we're expecting EIG Aero to be up mid to high single digits. We talked a little bit about Process already, but let me put some rough numbers behind it. Overall sales for the Process businesses were up mid single digits on a percentage basis. Organic sales were down low single digits on a very difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2012. Overall growth in the quarter, as I've indicated already, was driven by oil and gas and obviously, the contributions from the acquisitions that we did last year. For the full year, we expect our Process businesses to grow about 10%, with organic growth up low to mid single digits. And the last part of EIG is our Power and Industrial business. For that part of EIG, we were down mid single digits on a percentage basis. It was driven largely by weakness, as we had anticipated going into the quarter, in the heavy truck market. And for all of 2013, we expect sales for Power and Industrial to be up low single digits, with strength in Power being partially offset by a weakness in Industrial. So to sum those 3 parts of Aerospace, John, for all of EIG, we expect sales to be up high single digits and organic growth up low to mid single digits. Moving to EMG. If we look at the differentiated part of EMG, overall sales for those businesses were up mid-teens on a percentage basis, on strength in our third-party Aerospace MRO businesses, as well as the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition. Organic sales were down mid single digits in the quarter, driven by weakness in our EMIP business. For all of 2013, we expect these differentiated businesses to be up high single digits on a percentage basis and organic growth in the low to mid single digits. And the last part of the company is our cost driven motors business; that performed actually very well in the quarter. Sales were flat, but profit margins were really excellent. The Operational Excellence initiatives in cost driven motors have been really, really good. And for all of 2013, we expect sales for this business to be approximately flat. So if you sum those 2 parts of EMG, we're expecting for 2013 overall growth of mid to high single digits and organic growth similar to EIG in the low to mid single-digit arena. And in both of these segments, as we've already said, we expect the second half organic growth to be stronger than the first half. So that sort of gives you a rundown of the segments.
John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Great. And I was just curious on the cost takeouts that you've scheduled for the year, is there a way to parse them in terms of the ones that you think you're going to get volume leverage out of? The cost that really has long-term lasting benefits, is that most of it?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. I would say in terms of will these -- the benefits go into future years, the answer is definitely yes. We expect the annualized impact due to that $0.01 of charge we talked about to be around $10 million. And roughly, we're going to get half of that in this year. And in addition -- just I want to add one thing to that comment, John, that we're also -- and we talked about in the yearend conference call that we are continuing to make sizable investments in growth. We're putting about $35 million through the P&L to basically drive organic growth. And with these cost reductions that we have put in place, we have not done anything that's going to impact the longer-term growth of the company. So we've been very, very careful to target the reductions so that the organic growth of the company remains intact.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Frank, could you just address for a minute, in EIG, the acquisition contribution looks maybe lower than we would have thought. Are all those acquisitions on track from a revenue standpoint, or was something -- was there a first quarter impact there somewhere?
Frank S. Hermance: No, it's pretty much on track. We said -- or we felt that the impact of Dunkermotoren would improve as we went through the year, and in essence, it is doing that. So it had about -- on the EMG segment, it had about a 70 basis point impact. But we think over time, we will get those Dunkermotoren profit margins up very close to the other businesses of that type in the segment.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And again within EIG, though, it looks like the acquisition contribution in terms of revenue, again, it would seem Micro-Poise alone should have contributed maybe a bit more than total revenue seems to be.
Frank S. Hermance: Oh, okay, I see what you're getting at.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Maybe my math was wrong.
Frank S. Hermance: Richard, no, no, no. You got some math that's right. We had some technology deals that went through here, and they're very small. And I think that's probably where your calculations may not exactly line up. And Kevin can go through that with you after the call, if you would like.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then also, Frank, could you just talk to -- given our core growth rate up for the quarter of kind of minus 2%, you commented about international and, in particular, the BRIC countries being very strong. But I'm curious, when you look at some of the project pushouts, maybe the small marginal sales miss for AMETEK in the quarter, would you attribute that then to U.S. and Europe, given Asia looks pretty strong?
Frank S. Hermance: It's a very interesting dynamic, and I will -- but first, I'll give you the top line answer that definitely, we saw some weakness in the U.S. that was a factor in this. And there was strength, in particular, in China. But let me back up and talk about each of the geographic regions of the world because the numbers I'm going to tell you are not initially going to sound logical until I explain them. Actually, our strongest organic growth was in Europe, and the reason for that was really twofold. One was that we have our commercial and some of our business in regional aircraft, European businesses were very strong and the MRO business in Europe was very strong. That was one factor. And the second factor was CAMECA, which is one of our highest, and EIG businesses had very large shipments into Europe in the first quarter. Conversely, when we look at Asia, even though my comment about China being strong was a very accurate comment, when we look at all of Asia, Asia was actually down organically. And the reason was, it was just the antithesis from the viewpoint of CAMECA. They had shipped a large number of systems. And as you may recall, Richard, these systems are $2 million, $3 million, $4 million each, and we had a large number of them not in China, but into -- last year, into Taiwan and into Japan, which we didn't have this year. So the CAMECA business actually overall was pretty good, it's just that there was a geographic switch between Asia and Europe. And in general, the U.S. businesses were not all that strong. They were down sort of a mid single-digit type organic growth rate. So that's sort of what happened around the world. But China sales, just in themselves, were up like 18 or 19%. I hope that's not too confusing.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: No, that's okay. Was Europe then -- was it a plus low single-digit type number on the core?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, yes. Core growth was up about 4%.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just one last question, then. Well, let me just -- so the U.S. business was a minus mid single-digit, was that EIG related or EMG, or was there any particular market that surprised you on the soft side?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes. I mean, the one that surprised us on the soft side, and I mentioned it in my some of my comments previously, was our engineered materials, interconnect and packaging business, which is in the differentiated part of EMG. That business was weak during the quarter and weaker than we had anticipated than it was going to be.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just -- so one last question, on the military business -- the military aerospace businesses, excuse me, that held up longer than we might have thought through the end of last year. Was that -- how did that perform in the first quarter [indiscernible]
Frank S. Hermance: It's continued to do amazingly well. It -- we had -- it was down 1 point or 2, and that's all. And the orders are continuing to come in at a very strong clip. And when we look at that, we believe that a good part of that is related to the fact that we are in areas where the part of the DoD budget that we are linked to has a higher growth rate than the base DoD budget itself. And if you just looked at sequestration, although some of those reductions haven't really taken hold yet, it would be down maybe 5%, 6%, 7%, and what we're seeing is this negative 1, negative 2 kind of percent. So that's what we think. We think it will hang in there, at that rate, through the rest of the year. And even if we're a little optimistic on that side, we believe that the commercial side is going to just continue to do extremely well.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass from Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Frank, going back to the regions, how they're doing now. What are you seeing in the second half? I assume you're not anticipating CAMECA shipping all these systems for the full year, maybe you are. But is Europe going to be -- kind of trend to where everybody else is having, Europe right now, kind of flat to down, but U.S. you think is going to pick up?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I think as we go through the year, Mark, you're going to see a more realistic growth rate that lines up with the GDP parts of the world. I think you'll see that Europe will be the weakest of the 3 major regions, that the U.S. will be in the middle and Asia will still be the best performer.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: So it seems like 1Q is a little bit of an anomaly where you're doing well in Europe but poorly in the U.S. You expect that to flip?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I think you'll see some flip, but I don't think it's going to be at the magnitude that you're suggesting. And the reason is that we still have very strong organic growth in Europe from the Aerospace business. So we would be different than many other industrial companies that don't have that aerospace component. So I think we will be stronger in Europe, but -- than other companies. But still, of the 3 areas, it would be the weakest.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And, Bob, what were payables?
Robert R. Mandos: $343 million.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: $343 million?
Robert R. Mandos: Yes.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then lastly, Frank, haven't -- had a deal a little while, what are the expect -- what are the expectations right now between buyers and sellers? Had things gotten out of -- a little of out of whack, so you haven't been able to close deals and maybe you've thought, "we're ready to go to"? Just talk a little bit about the environment.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure. I mean, as you know, we had a phenomenal year last year. We closed 7 deals, and we closed 4 of them in the fourth quarter. So we feel very, very good about what we have done. And as we look forward, we also feel very good. The backlogs are strong. We've got a lot of deals on the table. In terms of multiples, I would say it's a mixed bag. I think you probably have heard me say this before, there are some deals that are very overpriced. And as a matter fact, I don't fully understand how other companies could acquire at the multiples that are at least being posted on those deals and really get an economic return. But then, there are other deals that are very reasonable, and we are obviously parsing our deals along the side that's reasonable. We view, the worst thing you can do on a deal is overpay because no matter what you do, from the viewpoint of the operating side, growth, whatever, you're just never going to get out of the fact that you've overpaid. So given that environment, and we feel pretty good about the rest of the year, we think growth will have a fine year, and stay tuned.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. So we get the sense that there's too many people chasing too few properties or that's what it seems like.
Frank S. Hermance: No, I think if you get to larger properties, there would be some truth to that. But in the area that we're focused on, these deals that are in that $50 million -- $150 million to $200 million region, we're seeing a fair number of good candidates, and we think we can close them with reasonable multiples.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Matt McConnell from Citi Research.
Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just to follow up on that question on the pipeline, are those frothy multiples, I mean, are those from strategics or is it private equity you find kind of boosting that up? Is staple financing kind of an issue again, or -- any insight there?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure. I mean, my comment was directed more to strategics that are buying some of these businesses. I don't want to talk about specific companies, but we just saw one come across our desk that their multiple was 15x trailing. And to buy a company, unless it's got unbelievable growth, which is kind of questionable in the environment we're in, it's hard to get an economic return at that level. Now in fairness, in the private equity world, there is more capital available, and they can nip at some of the low end of the strategic deals. But we haven't found it to be a major problem. We have not lost any substantial number of deals, matter of fact, I can't even think of one that we've lost recently that was because of a private equity buyer.
Matthew W. McConnell - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And could you discuss the kind of level of visibility that you have to that higher cost takeout target, the $95 million? And then I know that would not be considered like a maximum, but what's your flexibility to move that higher if you see any kind of end market softness through the rest of the year?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, great questions. First, the visibility is excellent. We're going to have no problems in being able to achieve a $95 million of savings that I have talked about. And I think many of you have followed us for a long time, and our view is, there's always additional cost activities. As a matter of fact, an internal philosophy we use is that there's no such thing as fixed cost because in essence, you can't take out fixed cost. And therefore, if need be, we would take actions if the volume did come in lower than we're hoping that it does or what we think our present forecast are. So there are other actions that we can take. We always have a list of actions. And we will make those decisions as we look at the incoming order rate and look at our earnings for the year. And I think I can say that in my 13 years as CEO, we've never missed a quarter in 13 years. So we've got a pretty good internal process that allows us to modulate even within the quarter to ensure that we make earnings.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital Markets.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Frank, maybe you can talk about a couple of the end markets within the business that you talked about. You had mentioned that Power and Industrial and EIG was a bit soft. It sounds like the differentiated businesses in EMG were also. Just sort of your thoughts on the drivers for the pickup throughout the year in those areas and how you feel about the visibility.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I think if I look at the Power and Industrial businesses, the weakness in the first quarter was driven by the heavy truck market, which is -- has been weak. If you look at the number of North American heavy vehicle -- heavy trucks that are going to be produced, the present estimates by most of the industry forecast are in the order of 240,000 trucks, down about 12%. And I would say that's consistent with what we are seeing. The comps do get a bit easier as we go through the year, which will help on the organic side. But in terms of total top line revenue, I don't think we're going to see a huge change in the Power and Industrial segment. It's different in the differentiated side. When we look at the differentiated side of EMG, and I've talked to the weakness in EMIP, which is our Engineered Materials, Interconnect and Packaging business, there is a specific market phenomena that is occurring there that we believe is going to correct itself as the year goes on, and that is, this particular business makes master alloys that are used in the production of titanium for the aerospace industry. And what is occurring there is that there was a buildup in inventory that happened really starting, let's say, in the beginning of the fourth quarter. And as a result, the shipments came down in the first quarter as they bled off that inventory. And obviously, with commercial aircraft production being very, very strong, we're going to see that trend correct itself as the year goes on, and that business, due to that market dynamic, will improve. So that we will see a stronger top line performance as the year unfolds.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that make sense. And then maybe just a follow-on, on China, we've certainly heard a mixed bag from a lot of companies this quarter. Just wondering kind of where you're seeing the strength, which businesses or products or applications. Just some color there.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure. I mean, our Process businesses were good in China, even our floorcare business was strong. So I wouldn't say there's any particular part of the portfolio. And strong is may be a relative word because we were growing organically in China at a 20%, 25% clip if we go back 1 year or 1.5 years ago, and now we're going strong mid single-digit kind of growth in terms of organics. So it's not where it was, but in relationship to other parts of the world, it's definitely strong.

Frank Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. Ametek had a solid fourth quarter to complete another outstanding year. We established quarterly and annual records for orders, sales, operating income, operating, margins, net income, diluted EPS, and operating cash flow. In addition, we acquired seven highly strategic businesses in 2012, establishing records for capital deployed and annual revenue acquired. For the full year 2012, sales were up 12%, operating income was up 17%, operating margins expanded 100 basis points to 22.4%, and diluted EPS ended at $1.88, a 19% increase over 2011’s diluted EPS.  In the fourth quarter, orders were very strong, increasing 28% in total and 4% organically. The core order trend within the quarter was positive with December being very strong. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.14. Sales in the quarter were up 10% to $841.8 million. Internal sales growth was down 2% while acquisitions added 13% and foreign currency translation was a one point headwind. Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 13% to $190 million from $167.4 million last year, reflecting the impact from our operational excellence activities. Operating income margin in the fourth quarter was a record 22.6%, a 70 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income was up 18% to $119.9 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.49 were up 17% over last year’s fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was excellent with both the fourth quarter and full-year results representing records. Operating cash flow was $192 million in the fourth quarter and $611 million for the year, up 25% and 20% respectively. Free cash flow was 140% of net income in the fourth quarter and 121% of net income for the full year. Backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was over $1.1 billion, an all-time record high. Working capital management was excellent and operating working capital was 17.5% of sales.  Before turning our attention to the individual operating groups, I would like to provide some perspective on the global macroeconomic environment. Overall, we saw a continued sluggish global macro environment. Customers delayed shipments in the quarter as a result of general economic uncertainty. Despite the slightly weaker than expected core sales growth in the quarter, the overall orders and order trends during the quarter were excellent. As is evident in our results, we are able to deliver exceptional operating performance and exceed our earnings estimates despite this weak macro environment. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will continue to aggressively manage our costs through this period of softness while continuing to make investments in strategic acquisitions, market expansion, and new product development initiatives. In particular, our deal pipeline is strong and we will remain active in acquiring businesses. Now turning to the individual operating groups, the electronic instruments group had a strong fourth quarter with tremendous operating performance. For the quarter, sales were up 12% to a record $494.5 million on solid core growth in our upstream oil and gas and commercial aerospace businesses, plus the contributions from the acquisitions of O’Brien and Micro-Poise. Internal growth was down 1%, acquisitions added 14%, and foreign currency translation was a one point headwind. EIG’s operating income increased 16% to $134.9 million and operating margins were up 100 basis points over last year’s fourth quarter to a record 27.3%, reflecting the excellent work from our business teams. The electromechanical group also had a good quarter. Sales were up 8% to $347.2 million on solid core growth in our precision motion control business and the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition. Internal growth was down 4%, acquisitions added 13%, and foreign currency was a one point headwind. EMG’s operating income increased 5% to $65.2 million and operating margins were 18.8%. Excluding the impact of the Dunkermotoren acquisition, EMG’s operating margins would have been 19.8%, up 40 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2011. Now turning to our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development, and acquisitions. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company. Our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. The results we announced today reflect the tremendous impact of our various operational excellence initiatives as we were able to expand operating margins 70 basis points in the fourth quarter to a record 22.6%. Operational excellence includes lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office operations, design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives, and the movement of production to low cost locales.  Through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement activities, we recognized $14 million in savings in the fourth quarter and $49 million in savings for all of 2012. Overall, we realized $85 million in total cost savings in 2012 through our operational excellence initiatives. Both the global sourcing and overall operational excellence savings for 2012 exceeded the guidance we provided at the end of the third quarter. Looking forward for 2013, we expect approximately $85 million in total cost savings through our operational excellence initiatives, including $50 million in savings from our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives.  Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for Ametek’s growth. In the fourth quarter, international sales represented 52% of our total sales. This is an increase from 50% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2011. We continued to make international investments to develop and expand our sales channels, service capabilities, and manufacturing footprint in order to position our business to capitalize on the attractive global growth opportunities.  Ametek’s advanced measurement and technology division has been awarded a multi-million dollar contract to deliver Ortek’s new Detective SPM spectroscopic portal monitors as the primary radiation and nuclear threat inspection solution for Abu Dhabi’s new flagship, state-of-the-art maritime port. The Detective SPM portal monitoring system is a modular solution that detects, identifies and locates fissionable nuclear material – that’s material that you can build a nuclear bomb from. The Ametek system incorporates the commercially-available IDM 200, the latest addition to its Detective family of high resolution radiation identifiers for homeland security. New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. In 2012, we spent 155 million, which was up 13% from 2011. In 2013, we expect to spend 172 million, an 11% increase over 2012. We’re excited about some recent product introductions. Ametek Aerospace and Defense has been selected by Snecma to provide pressure sensors and transducers for the newly developed Leap 1B engines that will be used to power the Boeing 737 Max. Ametek sensors and fluid management systems will provide the oil filter differential pressure sensor and the oil and temperature transducers. The value of the contract is estimated to be $35 million over the life of this program. Ametek Aerospace was previously awarded contracts to provide heat exchangers and sensors for the Leap 1A and Leap 1C engines being developed by Snecma for the Airbus A320 Neo and Comac C919. The total value of those contracts was $175 million over the life of the program. Ametek’s precision motion control division recently introduced high performance brushless DC motors which are slotless and used for medical applications requiring precision motion control such as high speed surgical instruments and dental tools. As the medical industry trends away from pneumatic devices in favor of DC motors, the industry requires a new level of performance from these motors. Ametek’s high performance brushless DC motors offer a number of benefits that make them especially suitable for demanding medical applications, including small size, high-speed performance, little or no EMI emissions, long life, and low audible noise. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 22% of sales in 2012, up from 20% the prior year, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers.  Turning our attention now to acquisitions, we had a record year for acquisitions in 2012. We acquired an excellent set of highly differentiated businesses that expanded our market opportunities and technology base in the area of precision motion control, high-end analytical instrumentation, cryogenic cooling, and aerospace MRO. For the year, we acquired seven businesses, deployed approximately $750 million in capital, and acquired approximately $450 million in annual revenue.  In the fourth quarter, we acquired five businesses: Micro-Poise, which we acquired in October and highlighted during our third party conference call, and four small technology acquisitions in December. I will provide a brief overview of the technology acquisitions. In mid-December, we acquired Aero Components International and Avtech Avionics and Instruments, both privately-held providers of third party MRO services for the global aerospace market. Both businesses are based in Miami. Aero Components and Avtech are strategically important as they provide Ametek with worldwide fuel repair capabilities and next generation avionics capabilities, both key technology gaps in our global MRO portfolio. These acquisitions are consistent with our stated strategy to expand our global third party aerospace MRO repair capabilities organically and through small targeted acquisitions. Also in mid-December, we acquired Sunpower, a leader in the design and development of high reliability sterling cryocoolers and externally heated sterling engines for medical, scientific, telecommunications, and space applications. Sunpower’s cryogenic cooling technology provides a critical enabling technology for use in our highly success Ortek Detective family of portable radiation identifiers. It also provides a technology platform to support the continued growth of this product family. Sunpower will become part of our advanced measurement technology division. And lastly, we closed the year with the acquisition of Crystal Engineering on December 31. Crystal Engineering provides Ametek with key pressure measurement technology as well as high-end portable digital calibration instruments which nicely complement Ametek’s test and calibration instruments businesses. Crystal strengthens our technology and product offerings in the calibration instrument market while it’s product line benefits from the global reach and resources of the electronic instruments group. Crystal will become part of Ametek’s measurement and calibration technologies division. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2013 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our backlog of deals is excellent, our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. Turning now to the outlook for 2013, we expect our businesses overall to show solid growth during 2013 with our longer cycle oil and gas, power, and aerospace businesses showing particular strength. We anticipate organic growth to accelerate throughout the year with the second half stronger than the first half. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2013.  We anticipate 2013 revenue to be up high single digits on a percentage basis from 2012. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid single digits for all of Ametek and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2013 are expected to be in the range of $2.07 to $2.12 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% over 2012, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth, our operational excellence initiatives, and the benefits and contributions from recent acquisitions. First quarter 2013 sales are expected to be up approximately 10% from last year’s first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.49 to $0.51 per diluted share in the first quarter, up 9% to 13% over last year’s first quarter.  So in summary, our overall businesses performed very well in the fourth quarter and in 2012, producing records for essentially all key financial metrics. Although the macroeconomic conditions created a more challenging environment in 2012 than expected, we were able to deliver exceptional operating results through a focus on executing our growth strategies. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizeable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. Bob Mandos will now cover some of the financial details, and then we’ll be glad to take your questions. Bob?
Robert Mandos: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a strong fourth quarter with excellent operating performance. I will provide some further details. In the quarter, total selling expenses were up less than total sales on a percentage basis due to good cost containment. General and administrative expenses were 1.2% of sales, below last year’s fourth quarter level of 1.5% of sales driven primarily by lower compensation and consulting spend in this year’s fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.8%, down from last year’s fourth quarter rate of 30.7%. The full year tax rate was 30.7% versus last year’s rate of 30.9%, and in line with our expectations. For 2013, we expect our tax rate to be between 30 and 31%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full-year rate.  On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.5% of sales in the fourth quarter. This near-record low level of working capital positions Ametek as one of the top performers in our peer group and is a direct reflection of the tremendous strides our business units have taken in driving towards operating excellence. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority.  Capital spending was $24 million for the quarter and $57 million for the full year. Full-year 2012 capital expenditures were 1.7% of sales. 2013 capital expenditures are expected to be about $65 million. Depreciation and amortization was $28 million for the quarter and $105 million for the full year. 2013 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $118 million. Our cash flow was excellent in the quarter and for the full year. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and full year were records. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $192 million, up 25% over last year’s fourth quarter; and full-year operating cash flow of $611 million was up 20% over 2011.  Free cash flow was $167 million for the fourth quarter, representing 140% of net income. For the full year, free cash flow was $553 million, approximately 121% of net income, continuing our strong free cash flow generation. Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy where we expended approximately $750 million on transactions in 2012.  Total debt was $1.45 billion at December 31, up $190 million from 2011 year-end. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $156 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at December 31 of 34%, down slightly from 35% at the end of 2011. At December 31, we had approximately $710 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary, we had an outstanding 2012, establishing records essentially for all the key financial metrics. We are well positioned for further growth both organically and through acquisitions with a strong balance sheet and cash flows. 
Frank Hermance: Great, thank you, Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks and we’ll now open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo: Hi guys, good morning. Just touching on the order trends, Frank, obviously you talked about the process in December being actually surprisingly stronger. Were the orders—I guess the strength in orders weighted towards one industry or a few industries that you can talk about?
Frank Hermance: Well, it was pretty broad-based if you actually look at some of the key drivers. The process businesses were particularly strong. The power businesses were particularly strong, and surprisingly our floor care business was also very strong. Aerospace on a quarter-over-quarter basis was not as strong as the three I just indicated, but that was because we had a very, very strong Q4 of last year. So the order trends in the quarter were surprisingly strong.
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo:  Great. And then as you look into ’13, obviously a lot of uncertainty out there, and you mentioned the areas where you’re expecting to see strength. But are there any areas that are still weak now that you’re starting to get the sense might be turning the corner as we head out into ’13 at this point?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, it’s a great question, Allison. I would say the key factor is probably geographic in nature where if you look at the fourth quarter, organic growth and sales for the Far East was not that strong, but orders were. So I think we are definitely starting to see a turn in Asia and in particular in China. Now, it will take a few more months to verify that trend, but when you read the fact that China is in fact improving, their PMI was better recently, that’s a key factor for us because we’ve got about 18 to 20% of our sales in that part of the world. So that’s probably a key factor in how well we’re going to do from an organic viewpoint next year. As you I think are aware, in Europe, although that’s probably one of the weakest global areas, our business tends to outperform because we’ve got aerospace businesses there that perform very well, and we also roll up the oil and gas business from the Middle East in our European results. So when you look at Europe, we tend to outperform. So that’s probably the best way to look at it, Allison.
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo: Great. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell from Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.
Matt McConnell – Citi:  Thank you very much. On the quarter specifically, could you give a little more insight into the several end markets in EMG where customers turned cautious; and then what are your assumptions for whether that caution persists into the start of the year? And maybe along with that, what’s the first quarter of ’13 organic revenue growth assumption?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, sure. Why don’t I just walk through EMG and give you a perspective of sort of what happened in the fourth quarter and how we see it going into 2013. As you know, in EMG we break that business down into differentiated and cost-driven motors. If you look at the differentiated side of that business, for all of 2012 our differentiated businesses perform quite well really on strength in our precision motion control and military businesses. If you look at the quarter, overall sales were up 10% driven by the contributions from the Dunkermotoren acquisition and strength in our core precision motion control business. Organic sales in the differentiated side were actually down mid-single digits in the quarter; and as I mentioned in my opening comments, we saw customers actually delay shipments across several parts of the differentiated business. And in particular answer to your question, our EMIP division, which has specialty metals types of focus, was one of those areas; and the other was our third party MRO business in aerospace. As we went through the quarter, we saw push-outs but the order trend was good, so it’s kind of a mixed message from that viewpoint. So looking ahead to 2013, we expect these differentiated EMG businesses to be up approximately 10% with organic growth up mid-single digits, so we do think the trends are going to get better.  Looking at the other side, the cost-driven motors organic growth in the fourth quarter was actually flat for the cost-driven motor business, but actually that was the best organic growth of the year for that business and that strength came out of North America. For 2013, we expect this business to be approximately flat. Specifically with respect to your question around the first quarter, what we’re assuming is sales to be up approximately 10%, and what we have budgeted is a flat core sales growth. I’m hoping that things are going to get better and we’re going to exceed that in the first quarter, but given some of these push-outs we saw in the fourth quarter, we’ve decided to take a conservative view of the first quarter. But we have good reason to believe that as we go through the year, things will improve. As I mentioned in Allison’s question, or my answer to Allison’s question, Asia in particular seems to be an improving trend, and also aerospace, as the OEMs increase their build rates, we see that improving through the year. It’s very strong now but we see it even getting better as the year goes on, and we think that will be a driver to our performance. So does that answer your question?
Matt McConnell – Citi:  Absolutely, that’s very helpful. Thank you. And if I could just follow up on the 2013 guidance, is it correct to assume incrementals are probably around the 30% range, maybe a tick below that? And then with growth led by some of the higher margin businesses plus 85 million of the next wave of cost take-outs, are those factored into that 30%? It seems that there could eventually be upside to that if growth is in the very low single-digit range led by some more profitable businesses.
Frank Hermance: Yeah, it’s a great question. I think it’s fair to assume a 35% contribution margin for next year—or for this year, excuse me, 2013. But when we talk about contribution margins, we exclude the effect of acquisitions because obviously you’re not going to get that level of contribution margin on the deals themselves. So I think using a 35% contribution model, extracting acquisitions in your model is a reasonable projection. We actually did much better than that in 2012 because of the cost take-outs. And yes, your point regarding the cost take-outs – you know, there’s really an equation here that involves pricing and the cost take-outs in one hand, and on the other would be inflation and investments in the business. So I’ll just give you some rough numbers – these are just sort of averages if you took the middle of our guidance, that we’re looking obviously for the 85 million in cost take-outs. We’re looking for pricing to be in the order of 1.5 to 2% of sales. In terms of investments, we’re going to—well, what we’ve got budgeted right now is about $35 million of investments, so then obviously the balance to that equation is inflation and of course the earnings that come from it. So it’s definitely possible that we could exceed the numbers that I’m talking about, but we usually take a fairly conservative view as to our earnings and I think most of you are aware that we’re very good at making our earnings estimates and hopefully exceeding them. So we’ll see what happens as the year transpires.
Matt McConnell – Citi: Okay, great. Best of luck. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Scott Graham – Jefferies:  Hey, good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask—Frank, I’m hoping that you’ll do your typical un-bundling of each of the business units as part of this question; but I think even more specifically, I was wondering if you could tell us—you know, I know that international continues to be a big thrust for you guys, but has that maybe changed form a little bit here to the extent that maybe we’re de-emphasizing Europe a little bit and maybe re-emphasizing the BRIC sales? At 50%, a little over 50%, are you looking to bring that number up into the 60s, or are you kind of happy with the 50 to 60% range? I was just wondering what the intermediate term view was on that strategically.
Frank Hermance: Okay Scott. Let me take the international growth question first, and then—I’ve already given you a breakdown of EMG. I’ll give you a breakdown of EIG so you have a better sense of what’s going on there. But if we looked at the international growth, you’re absolutely right that our focus is in BRIC. It’s not as much in western Europe or in the U.S. We see the growth coming out of the BRIC areas. Just to give you some numbers, in the fourth quarter BRIC orders were up 24%, and they were actually up organically 16%. So that bodes well, as I mentioned in response to Allison’s question, that things are improving and that’s where a large part of the growth is going to come from. Doesn’t mean that we’re not going to continue to put investments in the U.S. and continue to put investments in Europe in those areas that we think are good areas to invest, but clearly the focus is going to be in BRIC. Rolled up in our budgets for this year, we’re planning to add about 70 people, predominantly in sales and some in engineering and India into those areas to maximize our potential.  With regard to your specific around the percent of sales, we are inching that up. It was at 52% in the fourth quarter. It was 51% for the entire year of 2012; and yes, we would like to inch that up. If you look at our market opportunities, having 55 to even as high as 60% of our sales in international areas makes sense. It’s difficult, though, to grow that international—the BRIC content, I should say, the BRIC content because there aren’t a lot of acquisition opportunities there. So while it’s doing very good organically, it’s not as good from an acquisition viewpoint, so we tend to do the acquisitions more in baseline Europe and in the U.S., and therefore there’s an offsetting sort of dynamic that happens there. But in general, yes, we’d like to increase that. And then the first point you made, let me walk you through EIG since I already did EMG, and then you’ll have the full picture. In aerospace, our aerospace business had a strong year with really broad-based strength across all of its businesses. We won sizeable new content on a number of new commercial and business and regional jet platforms, and continue to expand our third party MRO capabilities on a global basis. In the fourth quarter, EIG aerospace sales were up mid-single digits. We saw continued strength in commercial aerospace and business and regional jets. Looking to 2013, we expect solid growth for our EIG aerospace business as our internal growth initiatives combined with trends in OEM build rates support really good commercial sales; and our business and regional jet business is also expecting to do very well, really driven more by key program wins on new aircraft than it is by a change in the marketplace. So included in our budget and outlook for 2013, we’re expecting EIG aerospace to be up mid to high single digits in 2013.  Taking a look at the process businesses, our process businesses had a strong year in 2012. We completed a number of key acquisitions during the year – O’Brien, Micro-Poise, and the recent technology acquisitions of Sunpower and Crystal. These acquisitions, coupled with the continued investment in R&D and global expansion initiatives position us pretty good for 2013. In the quarter, overall sales for process were up high teens on a percentage basis with flat organic growth. Overall growth was driven by strength in our oil and gas and ultra-precision technology businesses combined with the contributions from the O’Brien and Micro-Poise acquisitions. What we’re expecting in 2013 for our process businesses is to have them grow approximately 10% overall with organic growth probably conservatively estimated at low to mid single digits. We really expect the oil and gas business to continue to do well. And the last part of EIG is power and industrial. That business also did well in all of 2012. It was driven by strength predominantly in the power side of the business, and in the fourth quarter organic sales were actually down mid-single digits but that was against a very difficult comparison. For 2013, we’re expecting sales for power and industrial to be up low to mid-single digits. So if you sum all of EIG, we’re expecting sales to be up high single digits with organic growth of low to mid; and actually for EMG, we’re expecting very similar results with overall growth of high single digits and organic growth of low to mid-single digits. So that gives you a perspective across the company. Did I get all your questions, Scott?
Scott Graham – Jefferies:  Yeah, you did. That was terrific. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research:  Hi, good morning gentlemen. Okay, so—well, housekeeping. Payables?
Robert Mandos: $321 million.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: 321 million – okay, thank you. Frank, as you were going through aerospace, was that just EIG aero that you were talking about; and if so, what happened with overall aerospace in the quarter and what are your expectations for overall aero in 2013? And is the defense side, the military side getting affected by sequestration, anything like that?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, what I was referring to, since I was responding to the EIG part of the business, was essentially EIG. If you look at the full aerospace businesses, what we’re expecting in 2013 is to be up mid to high single digits. We expect it to be quite strong, and if you break it down by the various sub-segments, we’re expecting the commercial business to be up low double digits, we’re expecting the third party MRO business to be up low double digits, we’re expecting business and regional jets to be up mid single digits, and for military we are assuming in the overall mid to high single digit guidance a negative 5% for military.  Yes, we are seeing some impacts from sequestration, but actually our order intake and where we stand right now is pretty strong. It would surely beat that organic down 5%, but it’s pretty difficult to come up with an assumption as to what really is going to happen as Congress goes through its deliberations. So we took a conservative view of the military business, so if the military business actually does better than that, then we could be approaching the double digit arena for all of aerospace.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay. And then has the breakdown in aerospace shifted over the last year or two with some of the strength out of the other businesses versus, say, military—
Frank Hermance: Well, it’s a great question and you would think the answer would be yes, but the answer is actually there hasn’t been a dramatic change and that’s because the military business has continued to perform well. So the mix has remained pretty much the same, and if you look at the mix, about a third of our business is military in aerospace and the other two-thirds is commercial and business and regional jets, and third party MRO. So it’s changed a little bit, but not substantially.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay. And then final question on the power side, it sounds like industrial—well, the industrial side of power, which I think you have some exposure to oil and gas there as well, but also you have a military exposure to power. How is power looking if you maybe break it up that way in 2013?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, we don’t have a sizeable amount of our power business that is related to military. There is a little bit of that, but that was not a prime driver to the performance. Most of the power business is much more commercially oriented. We do have some military content but it is not a significant part of power overall. 
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Yes, good morning. Frank, could you just talk for a minute or two about the Dreamliner production disruption and how you’re thinking about that for the first quarter and into next year? I would think that would have a measurable impact on your growth rate there in aero.
Frank Hermance: No, it’s another great question, Richard. Actually when you look at our content on aircraft, we have a very varied content. We fly on just about every commercial plane there is, so this disruption that is occurring with the Boeing problems really is not going to have a major impact on our instrumentation business. It could have a little impact but it’s not significant in the grand scheme of things. The key for us on actually all of these new platforms is that you need to be on them, because eventually the new platforms are going to be the business. So we’ve put a lot of effort on getting on the 787, the 350, the 380, the Max, the Neo – all of those airplanes. But again, no one of them is significant. There’s another part of our business, which is the EMIP over in EMG, that makes master alloys for titanium, and there has been some disruption in that business but it’s not really driven by this recent problem on the 787. There was actually some build-up in the supply chain, so that business has been a little bit softer the last three months and will be a bit soft in the first quarter, but that’s included within the estimates that we have given you. So I think that’s the best way I can characterize the 787. Now obviously if the 787 is off the market for an extended period of time, as I think about I still don’t think there be a huge impact because what will happen is it will shift to other aircraft and we’ll just put product on different aircraft. But hopefully Boeing will get their arms around this and get it fixed.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then just a question on the geography – can you just rough out the size of China itself for ’12 and maybe what the expectation is there for growth in ’13?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, if you look at all of our Far East business, on a rough order it’s about 19% of our sales. The China piece is about half of that in rough numbers – these guys are looking up the exact numbers, but I know that’s kind of in the ballpark. The growth rate that we’re assuming in our budget and in our roll-up is really like a mid-single digit number. It’s not real aggressive, and actually when we put our numbers together, we didn’t have privy to how strong the orders were in the fourth quarter and therefore we took a more conservative view. So I as I said in my response to one of the questions, if that really comes back and you start to see the normal kind of growth over there, which would be more in the high single digit arena, we’ll do better than the estimates that I provided to you.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then again, if we look at ’13 and maybe the core growth assumption for ’13, if we’ve got maybe a mid-single digit for Asia, can you just fill in the blanks there? Is Europe expected to be up, flat, and then where does that leave the U.S. for ’13?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, actually what we’re assuming is similar growth in Europe and in the U.S., and the reason for that, which might be surprising, is what I mentioned before – we happen to have some businesses in Europe that will outperform the macroeconomic trends because we in essence have aerospace businesses there, both OEM and third party MRO, that are performing reasonably, and we also roll-up the oil and gas businesses from the Middle East there. So we’re expecting sort of low single digits from Europe, low single digits from the U.S., mid-single digits from Asia, and that’s sort of where this low to mid level comes from. I think we’ve got the opportunity to outperform that, but we’re taking sort of a cautious view with all of the uncertainty that’s going on in the world right now.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird: Sure, okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks, good morning. So an interesting kind of mismatch between the organic growth in the quarter and the orders resilience. I guess what it points to is a dynamic of project deferrals. I’m wondering what signs you’re seeing of that resolving. Doesn’t seem like you factor much into the first quarter on that dynamic kind of shifting.
Frank Hermance: Yeah, you’re right on. The fourth quarter was interesting because we did see these push-outs occur, and the orders were extremely strong. But we’ve been cautious on the first quarter. We want to see it play out. You would hope with the orders as strong as they were that we’ll see some better growth in Q1, but I want to run the business assuming that’s not going to happen and make darn sure we get the earnings, and then if we get a little bit better growth and some of those push-outs in effect land in Q1, and there isn’t more push-outs into Q2, we’ll obviously over-perform.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay. And in that dynamic of orders, goods, sales a little soft, can you break the U.S. out in that sense?
Frank Hermance: Actually when you look at the fourth quarter, by region of the world in sales, they’re all about the same. They’re all about the same. They’re all in this minus-1%, minus-2% kind of region, and it’s because of all the dynamics I’ve talked about where there were push-outs but aerospace tends to over-perform the market, and we didn’t see the sales growth yet in Asia. What we saw was the order growth, so that’s the dynamic. Very interesting.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: I guess the question was so the U.S. did participate in that dynamic where order growth outperformed sales growth as well?
Frank Hermance: Yes, yes. 
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay.
Frank Hermance: Yes, I’m sorry. I didn’t answer the question in the right way. Yes, if you’re asking by region where did we get the outperformance, yes, we definitely got outperformance in the U.S.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay. And then lastly on the operating margin, very strong in the quarter. What was the contribution of temporary belt-tightening?
Frank Hermance: I don’t think we have that rolled up, so I really can’t answer that specifically. But there definitely was belt-tightening because as we went in the quarter and we saw some of these project deferrals that you were referring to, we definitely tightened our belts. And as I mentioned, the actual cost savings overall that went through the P&L for the full year was actually higher than what we told you in the third quarter estimates, which means we actually did more than we had anticipated. Some of that is temporal, but also some of it is permanent, and that will help us as we go into 2013. But we’ve got significant confidence that this additional $85 million that I’m talking about that will roll through the P&L in 2013 will happen. I think you know we’re very good at this, we’ve got very detailed plans by division, by business unit, by product line in essence as to what we’re going to do and how we’re going to achieve that $85 million.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: I have noticed that. Thanks, Frank.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Jamie Sullivan – RBC Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. First question is a follow-on there on the margin – EIG at obviously record levels. It sounds like that may be sustainable. Just wanted to confirm that in your view.
Frank Hermance: Yeah, I do believe the EIG margins are high, obviously, but they’re at sustainable kinds of levels. As I’ve mentioned before, we think there is opportunity on the EMG side of the business because obviously the absolute level of those margins are lower, and that’s obviously part of our 2013 plan. If I were going to give you some guidance for 2013 when you roll all of the things up – the costs, the incremental effect from low to mid-single digit organic growth, inflation, investments, et cetera – what we have running through this is about 30 to 50 basis points of margin improvement.
Jamie Sullivan – RBC Capital Markets: Great, that’s helpful. And then just a follow-on on the oil and gas business where you’re expecting to see some positive trends in ’13. Can you talk a little bit more about maybe some of the applications and geographies where you’re expecting to see some of that strength?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, it’s clearly going to be driven from the international front versus the U.S. front. A good indicator of how well the oil and gas businesses will do is rig counts, and if you look at the worldwide rig counts, they’re essentially at record highs. There’s about 3,500 active rigs on a worldwide basis, but if you look at the growth that has occurred and is expected to occur, the U.S. rig count is actually going down while the international rig count is going up. So there’s a dynamic below the top line of what’s happening, and that plays well to us because about 70% of our business is outside the U.S. in this particular business. We’ve particularly focused internationally because there’s a lot of expansion going on in that area.  There’s also this dynamic of fracking, which is a hot political topic in the U.S., and at some point I think we’ll bust through that because we’ve got enough both oil and gas below us right here in the U.S. to really become energy independent, and we really need to capitalize on that. But the rig count is going down in the U.S. right now.
Jamie Sullivan – RBC Capital Markets: Thanks, and if I could just sneak one more quick one in?
Frank Hermance:  Sure.
Jamie Sullivan – RBC Capital Markets: On the cost-driven motors business, comps are starting to turn flat, potentially turning positive. Just want to get your perspective there on does that make you potentially more positive on early cycle recovery, or do you see that as less of kind of a canary in the coal mine indicator business at this point?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, we do have—I have more confidence this year than I have over the past several years in our floor care business. It’s not because of a fundamental change in the market dynamics. It’s really driven by the fact that we have won some business, major business with one large customer. I can’t speak to who that is, but it’s a substantial amount of business that you may recall I mentioned that our orders were strong in the fourth quarter, and that also was driven by this major customer. So I think we’re going to see better results out of that business over the course of actually the next few years, based on the relationship that we have developed with this customer. And also, these are high-end motors which means that the profit margins are higher than the base business; so you detected a signal from me, but it’s not because of the market. 
Jamie Sullivan – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
Joe Radigan – KeyBanc: Hi, good morning, Frank. This is actually Joe Radigan on for Matt. I just had a quick follow-on on the order rates. Just in terms of the sequential cadence during the quarter, I believe you said you saw a ramp up that peaked in December. Can you comment on what you’ve seen so far in January? Have you seen a continuation of that progress in order rates into 2013?
Frank Hermance: You know, I don’t have—on a sequential basis, I actually don’t have that information. What I can tell you is we are on target for our January orders. We get those on a daily basis. Do you guys know? I don’t have that.
Robert Mandos: We’d have to look that up sequentially.
Frank Hermance: Okay. So we’ll have to get that for you. I just don’t have it at my fingertips. But I think the key point is we’re surely in line with the guidance I’ve given you for the first, say, three weeks or whatever of January.
Joe Radigan – KeyBanc: Okay, perfect. Thanks. That’s all I had.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question coming from the line of Matt McConnell with Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.
Matt McConnell – Citi: Great, thank you. I wonder if I could slip in a quick follow-up on Dunkermotoren. I know it’s been probably two or three quarters since that closed. Could you give an update on how that integration’s been going and maybe profitability, and I think it was a one point drag to the EMG margin. Was that roughly in line with your expectation? 
Frank Hermance: Yeah, it’s now performing very good. I’m very, very pleased with the operating team there. We just did a review recently and that team has embraced the Ametek culture, and they’re very good and their profit margins are lower – there’s no question. We knew that when we acquired them. As we do with most acquisitions, we’re going to continue to work and improve those margins, and your analysis is right – it was about 100 basis points improvement. And actually just to expand on your question, this is not going to be an atypical situation as we go forward because obviously if you look at our margins with respect to peer companies, our margins are very high; so there is going to be an impact on the margins when you bring in deals. And our preference is actually to bring in deals that have lower margins because part of the value we can create is to increase those margins. So I would say Dunker is a typical example of that, so we view that from a return on invested capital viewpoint because we buy these businesses at, say, 10% pre-tax profits, and over the course of a relatively short period of time, we can make many of these businesses 20%-plus pre-tax. That just means the return on invested capital is off the charts. 
Matt McConnell – Citi: Okay, great. Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question coming from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Just real quickly, Frank – you talked about 85 million in gross savings in 2013. 
Frank Hermance: Yes.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: And you had 85 million in ’12, correct?
Frank Hermance: That’s correct.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Now if I remember, you guided 60 million at the very beginning of 2012, so you outperformed—
Frank Hermance: That’s correct.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: So how much of that was—I mean, certainly some of that is probably due to acquisitions you made over the year and then you got some additional savings there, but how much can you say was organic, if I can put it in that way? Does that make sense?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, it does. Great question. I can give you a gut feel. I can’t give you exact numbers. But my gut feel is that probably 70% of that was organic, and what happened in 2012 – and your numbers are correct – when we started the year, we assumed 60 million; but then as we were going through the year with the macroeconomic uncertainty, and we saw that we weren’t going to get as much top line, as was true for most industrial companies, we focused on increasing that number from the $60 million kind of region up to what ended up to be 85 million. So I think there’s some room as we go through this year. It would not surprise me if as we get into the year, our businesses do better than the 85 million. There probably is not as much leverage as we got in 2012; in other words, going from 60 to 85. I doubt we’ll go from 85 to 85 plus 25, but I think the number could be higher. Does that help?
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Very much so. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Mr. Coleman, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to you.
Kevin Coleman: Okay, great. Thanks everyone for joining our conference call. As a reminder, a replay of this call may be accessed at Ametek.com and at StreetEvents.com, and I am obviously available all day for any questions at 610-889-5247. Thanks so much.

Frank Hermance:  Thanks Kevin, and good morning everyone. AMETEK had a strong third quarter. We established records for sales, operating income, operating margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Sales in the quarter were up 12% to $839.4 million. Internal growth was up 2% and met our expectations, while acquisitions added 12% and currency was a 2% headwind.  Operating income for the third quarter was superb. It increased 18% to a record $188.2 million, from a $159.6 million last year, reflecting the impact from our operational excellence activities and our longer cycle, higher-margin businesses. Operating income margin in the quarter was a record 22.4%, a 110 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2011. Net income was up 18% to $115.4 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.47 were up 18% over last year’s third quarter and above the top end of our prior guidance of $0.46. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records. Operating cash flow in the quarter was superb at $163 million, a 19% increase over the last year’s third quarter. Free cash flow was also very strong at $150 million, or a 130% of net income. Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1 billion. Orders in the third quarter were $800 million, up 10% from the prior year. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups, the electronic instruments group had a solid third quarter. Sales were up 12% to $457.1 million on strength in our oil and gas, aerospace and power businesses in addition to the contributions from the acquisitions of O’Brien, TMC, EM Test, and Reichert Technologies. Internal growth was 4%, while acquisitions added 10% to sales and currency reduced sales by 2%. EIG’s operating performance was excellent. Operating income increased 19% to $121.6 million and operating margins were a record 26.6%, up 160 basis points over last year’s third quarter. The electromechanical group also performed very well in the quarter. Sales were up 12%, to a record $382.3 million on strength in our differentiated businesses and the contributions from the acquisitions of Dunkermotoren. Our cost-driven motors business remained weak in the quarter. For all of EMG internal growth was flat, acquisitions added 14% to sales and foreign currency reduced sales by 2%. EMG’s operating income increased 13% to $77.3 million and operating margins increased 20 basis points to 20.2%. Focusing now on our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development, and acquisitions. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our continued focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. The results we announced today reflect a tremendous impact of our various operational excellence initiatives as we were able to expand operating margins in the third quarter by 110 basis points to a record 22.4%. Operational excellence has many facets within AMETEK, including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factory and back office operations, designed for Six Sigma and our new product development efforts and the movement of product to low-cost locales. We also continued to drive lower costs through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. From these sourcing activities, we recognized approximately $13 (ph) million in savings in the third quarter and expect $48 million in sourcing savings for all of 2012. Overall, we expect $80 million in total cost savings for all of 2012, an increase in the guidance we provided at the end of the second quarter. We are prepared to take further cost actions if necessary. Moving to our second strategy, global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK’s growth. In the third quarter of 212, international sales represented 52% of our total sales. Growth in Asia and Europe was strong in the quarter. We continue to make investments in global and market expansion initiatives. The following are some examples of recent successes. AMETEK’s SPECTRO Analytical Instruments business was awarded a number of orders in the BRIC regions in the third quarter. These wins highlight the strength of SPECTRO’s product offering across a variety of market applications as well as SPECTRO’s continuous success in the BRIC regions. In India, SPECTRO booked an order with the India government for a highly configured SPECTRO lab for the chemical analysis of nine different base metals. The complex analytical requirements could only be fulfilled with our product. In China, a leading oil fuel research institute ordered a SPECTRO XEPOS for trace elemental analysis in crude oil. XEPOS’s excellent sensitivity for the elements of interest was the deciding factor. AMETEK’s Aerospace and Defense business secured a multimillion dollar order for a thermal management system upgrade for the M1A2 Abrams Tank supplied to the Saudi Arabian armed forces. The environmental control system components we are providing include 5 Hughes-Treitler heat exchangers that will provide crew, vehicle and electronics cooling. In addition to the initial order, there is a planned option for an additional $1.7 million in products sales in the fourth quarter as well as potential near term sales to other foreign military operations. AMETEK’s Aerospace & Defense business is very well positioned to capture additional foreign military sales. Moving to our third strategy, new product development is a key to our long term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. In 2012, we expect to spend $155 million, a 12% increase over 2011. We are excited about some recent new product introductions. AMETEK’s Process & Analytical Instruments business introduced several new products in the third quarter which complement our existing products serving in upstream oil and gas market. Chandler Engineering introduced two advanced well completion tools. The model 5600 Shear History Simulator, which measures the property of oil and gas well fracturing fluids, and the model 8500 Pressurized Foam Rheometer which measures the properties of oil and gas well drilling foams. In addition, AMETEK’s Solartron ISA business introduced the Seastream FloCalculator, a subsea flow meter that provides unrivalled accuracy in measuring the output of deep sea oil and gas wells. Also in the third quarter, AMETEK’s Programmable Power Business extended its line of solar array simulators introducing the ETS80, a Photovoltaic Simulator providing industry leading performance to support the fast growing micro PV inverter market. The simulators are used to validate and test micro and string inverter designs used in commercial, industrial and residential solar energy systems. AMETEK'S proprietary combination of hardware, software and firmware allow the stimulators to emulate a wide range of test protocols in real world operating conditions. The ETS80 complements our existing ETS600 and ETS1000 standalone stimulators for string inverter applications, allowing us to offer a comprehensive family to support Photovoltaic inverter test needs. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 21% of sales in the quarter, versus 20% in last year's third quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. And finally the fourth strategy of AMETEK is acquisitions. We’ve had a very strong year thus far in 2012. We’ve acquired three highly strategic businesses: O'Brien in the first quarter, Dunkermotoren in the second quarter and Micro-Poise Measurement Systems which we announced this morning. Micro-Poise is the world's largest and most technologically advanced provider of integrated test and measurement solutions for the tire industry, Micro-Poise products are used by tire manufacturers to test and measure tire quality and to assess potential quality defects. Micro-Poise is the global leader in this niche market with long term relationships with most of the top tire manufacturers. It has a 50% market share, in this niche.  Micro-Poise was privately held and has annual sales of over approximately 125 million. The price paid was approximately a $170 million. The business is headquartered in Streetsboro, Ohio with additional manufacturing locations in Michigan, Germany and China. Approximately 75% of sales are outside the U.S. and given their sizable installed base of measurement equipment, approximately 35% of total sales are in the aftermarket. Micro-Poise is an excellent acquisition for us as it further broadens our position in a highly attractive materials test and measurement equipment market. With the acquisition of Micro-Poise, we have acquired $400 million in revenue and deployed approximately $670 million in capital thus far in 2012. Both the acquired revenue and deployed capital are record levels. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially given the weakness in the global economy. Our pipeline of deals remain strong with an attractive mix of acquisition candidates with a variety of sizes and markets and geographic concentrations. Our balance sheet is strong, our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity and we have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support the acquisitions focus. Turning to the outlook for the remainder of the 2012, we anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double digits on a percentage basis from 2011. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis for of AMETEK. Earnings for 2012 are now expected to be in the range of the $1.85 to $1.87 per diluted share, up 17% to 18% over 2011. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $1.83 to $1.85 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2012 sales are expected to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from last year’s fourth quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.46 to $0.48 per diluted share, up 10% to 14% over last year’s fourth quarter. So in summary our overall business performed well in the third quarter, despite a continued sluggish global environment. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will respond with additional cost containment actions if needed to ensure our cost structure is aligned with the slowing global economic environment. We have a strong balance sheet that generates significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development, as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. Our strong backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2012. Bob Mandos will now cover some of the financial details and then we will be glad to take your questions.
Bob Mandos: Thank you Frank. As Frank noted, we had a strong third quarter with excellent financial performance and a very high quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. Growth in selling expenses was in line with growth in sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales, below last year’s third quarter level of 1.5% of sales.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.4%, up from last year’s third quarter rate of 29.5%. We anticipate a tax rate of between 30% and 31% for the full year of 2012. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 18.2% of sales in the third quarter, up slightly from last year’s third quarter level. Capital spending was $13 million for the quarter. Full year 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $60 million. Depreciation and amortization was $27 million for the quarter. For all of 2012 we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $107 million. Our cash flow was excellent in the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $163 million, up 19% over the cash flow from last year’s third quarter and at a record level. Free cash flow was $150 million in the quarter, representing 130% of net income. Operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $419 million, up 18% from the same period in 2011, and free cash flow was $386 million for the nine months ended September 2012, representing 140% of net income. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income.  Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we extended approximately $500 million through September 30. Total debt was $1.37 billion at September 30, up $180 million from the end of 2011. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $163 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 33%, down from 35% at the end of 2011. At September 30, we had approximately $800 million of cash in existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Micro-Poise Measurement Systems. Capital deployed was $170 million, which brings our cumulative expenditures for acquisitions in 2012 to approximately $670 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. In summary we had a very solid third quarter, establishing records for all key operating metrics. We are well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flow.
Kevin Coleman: Great, thanks Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). One moment please for the first question. And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo: Frank, I think you mentioned, and maybe I'm hearing incorrectly that you said Asia and Europe were strong for you and I guess it's contrary to what we've been sort of hearing. Could you discuss that a little bit.
Frank Hermance: Yes, actually if we look geographically for us, in terms for full sales for Asia we were up about 13%, for Europe about 25% and the U.S. was up 6%. If you look organically it was 5% in Europe, 5% in Asia and actually negative 1% in the U.S. So there definitely was strength in our international businesses, at least as compared to the U.S business and that was driven by a number of factors. In particular our Aerospace and Power businesses were strong outside the United States. We are gaining share in parts of our MRO business outside the United States, in particular in Europe. So that had a positive impact on the results and although Asia at 5% is down from what we were growing substantially, a year up to two ago, it still was relatively good with a number of our instrument businesses. In particular our Oil and Gas and our Med division were very strong in the quarter. So overall international was okay for us.
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo: Great, and that order, I think you said they were up 10%. What was the core of that and also any noticeable trends in the quarter into October?
Frank Hermance: The trends were good. Basically the trend was up with each month in the quarter sequentially better than the previous month; so that was encouraging. Core was down slightly but that was on a very tough comparison.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Berry with UBS. Please proceed.
Robert Berry - UBS: I was wondering if you could update us on how price rise and cost impacting, and in particular, if you are starting to see any movement in your favor on commodities.
Frank Hermance: Yes, in terms of price for the quarter, we were up about 2% which was what we had anticipated and we have a measure of price minus inflation with inflation is everything like material, wages et cetera, and when we sum that up, the pricing minus net inflation was up about a percent and that’s about what it has been. So I would say, I have seen no real change in that trend. Even though the global economy is obviously a bit weaker, we have been able to get the pricing and that’s predominantly because of the niche focus that we have where price is low on the buy or purchase criteria. So we are able to get the pricing. In terms of your question on commodities, we have structured the company in a way that commodity prices do not have a major impact on the bottom line and that is done through agreements that we have with our customers, where there are escalators in our contracts, on the customer side and as you know we are very, very good on the input side; so that in essence are bottom line is not dramatically changed in either direction via commodity changes. It does have an impact on overall organic growth and actually in the third quarter, we probably lost about a point of internal growth, maybe a little bit less than that due to the reduction in commodity pricing but again the bottom line was secure as you can see from our results.
Robert Berry - UBS: Yes. Absolutely very solid results, congrats on that. Just maybe finally, I was curious to dig in more on some of these later cycle end markets, oil and gas, aero, power but, maybe it makes sense for you just to walk us through EIG as you often do.
Frank Hermance:  Sure. I’ll go through EIG and I will start with aerospace. Our overall aerospace business really performed extremely well in the quarter. We had high single digit organic growth, on broad based strength in essentially all parts of our aerospace business. In particular, our commercial OEM business was particularly strong. For all 2012, our anticipation is that the commercial business and our business and regional jet business will be up low double digits organically, and our third party MRO and military businesses, each will be up mid-single digits and our military business also was pleasantly surprising in a sense of being very strong in the third quarter. So, we are predicting, and as we have predicted that overall aerospace for the full year 2012 should be up mid to high single digits and probably those are leaning now to the higher single digits versus mid, just based on the third quarter results. Our process businesses performed well in the third quarter. Sales were up about 10%. Upstream oil and gas continued to show sizeable strength while, as I mentioned also our Material Analysis Division was also very strong. Obviously, the growth benefited from the O’Brien, TMC, and Reichert acquisitions in the process part of the business. Organic growth was up low single digits in the quarter and again business was solid internationally. For all of 2012, we expect this business to grow mid-teens on a percentage basis with low to mid-single digit organic growth and in particular we expect continued strong performance from our later cycle upstream oil and gas businesses, just doing extremely well. And the last part the EIG is power and industrial and overall for the third quarter sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis, driven by strong growth in our power business, also the contribution from the EM Test acquisition and our heavy vehicle business also showed particular strength in the quarter. Sales grew mid-single digits organically for all of power and industrial and for 2012 we expect sales for power and industrial to be up high-single digits overall and low-single digits organically. So if you sum these various parts of EIG, we are expecting 2012 sales to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis with organic growth of low to mid-single digits. And why you didn’t ask about EMG, I’m sure some others will ask, so I’ll just continue on and tell you what happened in EMG. In the differentiated part of EMG, overall sales were mid-teens on a percentage basis in the quarter while organic sales were up low single digits. We had great growth from our precision motion control and also our military businesses and obviously we also had the contribution from the Dunkermotoren acquisition and for 2012, overall we’re expecting this business to be up approximately mid-teens with organic growth of low single digits. And the last part of the company is our cost driven motors business. Here sales were down organically mid-single digits in the third quarter, due to continued weakness in our international business. So this was an area of weakness outside the United States. For 2012, we expect sales to be down mid-single digits over 2011. So if you sum these two parts of EMG, we expect all of EMG in 2012 for sales to be up approximately 10%, and organic growth of low single digits and then as I mentioned in my opening remarks, if you know sum what I just said in EIG and EMG, for AMETEK as a whole we’re expecting this low double digit sales growth on a percentage basis with organic growth of low to mid-single digits for the year. I hope that helped you Robert?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies Capital please proceed.
Scott Graham - Jefferies Capital: So, if I’m trying to tease out the fourth quarter sales guidance little bit, it looks like you’re saying organic are about up 2 to 3? Does that sound about right.
Frank Hermance: Maybe that’s a bit high but we basically, with what’s going on in the global economy, when we put our estimates together, we assumed essentially similar performance to the third quarter, which is up in that low single digit arena; and as you know, we’re very good on the cost side of the business. So we added another $5 million in cost savings. So we have extreme confidence I would say in our earnings for the remainder of the year and with this slowing economic environment we are putting a real focus on both cost and acquisitions, because the organic growth for most companies as you’re well aware is in the low single digit kind of arena and that’s not what’s going to drive overall profitability as we go forward here in the short term. So this focus on cost and focus on acquisitions are the two strategies that we’re emphasizing.
Scott Graham - Jefferies Capital: Understood, could you give us an idea of what the EBITDA margin was for Micro-Poise or alternatively the vicinity of the multiple that you paid for that business?
Frank Hermance: Yes, we paid about 7.5 times for the deals and the EBITDA margins are below those of AMETEK and as you are aware, the EBITDA margin of our company is quite high. Actually in the quarter it was about 25%. So most deals that we do now are going to have lower EBITDA margins but that basically speaks to our strength. We see substantial cost and improvement opportunities and synergies with Micro-Poise. We’ve got a management team there that’s excited to be part of our company and when you look this deal from a return-on-invested-capital viewpoint, it’s going to be a home run for us.
Scott Graham - Jefferies Capital: Understood. Last question is on the pipeline. You were pretty confident when I saw you last about being able to do something potentially sizable in the fourth quarter. Was this it or is it possible we could get more, still to come in the fourth quarter.
Frank Hermance: Definitely it’s possible for more. The backlog is very good in terms of deals. We are working on other deals as we speak. When we did talk, I was specifically referencing Micro-Poise, which I knew was going to close, but we have some other deals. We’re looking at one now which is of equal size to Micro-Poise. We have some other smaller deals, more technology oriented deals. So if you look at the next six months, I would be very surprised if you did not hear from us again. We’ve got tremendous cash flow in the company and we feel the best way to utilize that cash flow is to acquire and improve companies.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley: So, a couple of questions for you. Maybe we could talk a little bit about Micro-Poise. I know you mentioned that it has a strong base of international sales, about 75%. Can you just flush that out between Europe and Asia?
Frank Hermance: Yes. If you look at Asia, it’s about 44% of sales and Europe is about 25% and the U.S. was about 25% and there is a little in other parts of the world. So this business is heavily focused on the automotive increases in Asia. That’s where we see the growth trend of this business. We did a lot of work on looking at the organics side of this business. The organic growth worldwide is going to be a number in the 7%, 8% kind of region and another very positive attribute to this business is that, it’s got sort of a counter-cyclical effect in that there was very strong portion of the business that’s in the aftermarket. It’s about 35% of the business, so that as the automotive cycle goes down and obviously we’re in an up-cycle right now, but as it goes down there is a balance in this business because people still have to put tires on their cars in essence and that counter-effect of people buying tires for existing automobiles is a counter to the cycle. So we’re pretty excited about this business. It’s a niche business. As you know, everything we do is very niche oriented. It’s got this 50% share, it’s got the international focus. So we think this business is going to be a home run for us.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley: And then on the U.S., you guys mentioned that you had a 1% decline. Can you just talk about, have your customers, are they concerned about the fiscal cliff (ph), the election? Is that driving a positive investment that you think picks up again in 2013.
Frank Hermance: Well, that’s a very, very tough question and I think that’s the key question as we look at next year. We are just starting to roll up our budgets and I’m going to be interested to hear what are our businesses say. I can only speculate Nicole. I really don’t know but the weakness was general. It was not in any specific business or specific area. It was in EIG, it was in EMG. I’ve got to believe this fiscal cliff (ph) is part of the issue and just general nervousness with the election et cetera is a factor. Some of our customers are talking about push-outs. They are not saying they are losing share. We have not felt that we are losing share in our businesses. So it’s a very difficult question to answer, but obviously we are being cautious as we go forward and our guidance for the fourth quarter and the fact that we took some additional cost actions is a reflection of that cautiousness.
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley: Okay, I’ll just squeeze in one more before I pass it along. Talking about pricing trends during the quarter, did you see any areas of weakness, and actually the EIG margins were extremely strong. Is there anything special going on there or do you see those as sustainable in the future.
Frank Hermance: Well, I think the EIG margins are sustainable. Our team has done just an incredible job of first selecting businesses that we acquire and also putting new product development and global expansion in these niche markets that have high margin capability and it really comes down to the differentiation of the product. So, it’s just a very, very positive trend. I think as we go forward, the margins in EMG are going to be the ones that have the higher potential and there is several factors to that. One is continued trust in terms of cost reductions, buying businesses like Dunkermotoren that have good inherent margin capability and also just as this business shifts from the cost driven side to the more differentiated businesses, as a result of our strategy, those margins will expand. So, I do think that the margin capability is going to be higher in EMG than EIG as we go forward. And there was another part to your question?
Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley: Oh I was just curious on pricing, if you saws any areas of concern?
Frank Hermance:  The only, I mean I don’t think there is anything that is different. The pricing weakness in the company follows the level of differentiation. So, it’s harder in our cost driven businesses to get pricing and as you go further up the differentiation curve, we are able to get much higher pricing and that basically sums to this 2% that I was talking about. But I don’t think that should change. That’s pretty similar to what is has been historically. So, I don’t see a trend change. I think it’s just the normal dynamics of our business.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please proceed.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just a follow up to the last line of questioning; Frank, what were your core incremental margins, excluding acquisitions in EIG and EMG during the quarter?
Frank Hermance: They were just off charts, no other way to say it Matt and to a certain degree when you have this low organic growth number, the incremental margins are less important but I can tell you that the contribution margins were well, well above 40%.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, and then similar to a prior question; some of what you sell, particularly in the high-end process business, definitely runs through customers capital budgets. Some of these instruments can sell for tens, hundreds and even, $2 million apiece. Are the discussions you are having with customers indicative of you C level executives going back and re-examining that capital budget? Do they need to buy it this year? Can they push it out? And have you in fact seen any sort of slippage yet, in some of those higher end process businesses?
Frank Hermance: Interesting question, Matt. I would say that we definitely had the impact that you’re talking about in some of our lower priced instruments, or maybe I should say medium priced instruments, where there definitely is this sort of concern and indecision and we definitely heard people saying we’re going wait a quarter, this is going to be pushed out and I’m sure internally in those companies that’s being impacted by upper management having a concern over their capital budgets. Interestingly though, at the very high end of our business, it’s absolutely the opposite, where I think you’re familiar with our CAMECA business and that business tends to go counter-cyclical to the semiconductor cycle and when things are weaker in semiconductor, basically the semiconductor companies put more investment in RD&E. So that business is just doing incredibly well for us. So it’s an interesting dynamic, the thesis of your question. Just stepping back you would think would be accurate but in fact it’s not for the reasons that I indicated.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: That’s interesting. Thanks for the perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets please proceed.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: First question, just a follow on the U.S. commentary. Was it pretty consistent throughout the quarter? We’ve heard from some companies talking about how the quarter kind of weakened as it went on or September didn’t ramp as expected. Just kind of wondering how you felt throughout 3Q?
Frank Hermance: I didn’t feel that. As I mentioned we had a very strong end of the quarter and it was pretty consistent within the framework of the higher growth internationally and subdued growth in the U.S., but I didn’t feel a trend change and I have heard other companies make the comment that you’re marking but I can say we’re an abnormality there.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, and then, just on the cost savings front, you ratcheted that up a bit. Was that due to out-performance of those initiatives versus your expectations or more of a step up due to the sluggish demand environment you’re sort of seeing right now?
Frank Hermance: Yes, it was the latter. We’re just feeling that things are a bit sluggish and we decided early in the third quarter, after our last earning’s release that we were going to take additional actions. We did that and in essence, we added that extra $5 million cost savings, which obviously is going to largely come in to the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter and that’s why we have this very high confidence level in our earnings. We’re not going to rely on organic growth to be the driver. We’re going to rely on cost reductions and our acquired businesses, as I said before.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, and the motor segment or the other, I guess you know how much of them, do you feel you have to continue those initiatives, if the environment stays consistent where it is?
Frank Hermance: Yes, we feel there is a significant additional leverage. It’s an advantage of a niche-oriented acquisition strategy that we have. As we buy these businesses, there are significant improvements and consolidations that are possible. You can see we’re relatively balanced between EIG and EMG in terms of those acquisitions. So we see substantial opportunity there and there is another thrust that we have not talked about a lot externally, but we’re putting a lot of energy now into value engineering. We have trained our entire engineering teams on value engineering and we’re basically doing things with our existing products, where we can lower the cost and raise their margins and Bob, maybe you can help. I think what I saw was this year about $11 million. Is that the right number?
Bob Mandos: That’s correct.
Frank Hermance: Yes, it was about an $11 million this year that we’re getting to the bottom line as result of value engineering. So it’s just another thrust and it’s in both parts of the business. So we’re just aggressive. We’re relentless in terms of getting cost out of the businesses and it’s the key driver as to why AMETEK performs extremely well in these weak environments and we tend to outperform our peers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Baliotti with Janney Montgomery Scott, please proceed.
John Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott: Bob, maybe in honor of my predecessor Jim Lucas, could you give us that payables number?
Bob Mandos: Sure, $288 million.
John Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott: Great. Frank, it’s encouraging to see the benefits you are taking, the cost actions are coming through so quickly and I know all the companies that we follow are pretty different, more different than they are alike, but do you have any sort of expectation as far as the lasting benefits, or sort of the follow on benefits you will get in addition to shoring up some of the lack of visibility this year, but they may feel the build on in 2013 or years beyond.
Frank Hermance: I would say, the majority of the savings we’re talking about will continue on. A good part of this $80 million is material cost savings on the input side. It’s about $48 million. So that will continue. You will see a year-over-year positive impact, because obviously we put these cost reductions in incrementally throughout 2012 so that you will see a year-on-year benefit, just due to that timing impact, and then we will have another program for next year, which Bob actually drives that will give us additional material savings, give us additional value engineering. We will have additional movement of products to low cost manufacturing, which for us will be China, Mexico and Eastern Europe. So we continually will put cost reductions through the P&L. It’s sort of a hallmark of our company. A little bit of the $80 million in fairness was what I would call belt tightening and our businesses and I’ve seen it in some of their spreadsheets, when they send them in to come to this $80 million, their hope is business will be better so that they could spend some of that belt tightening reductions they’re putting in place this year; and I think what that will really depend on is what we see next year. If things feel a little better, as we get into the first quarter then we will basically probably spend that and it will not be incremental sort of year-to-year but if its weak, we will just keep our belts tighter. But I would say the majority is definitely stuff that will continue.
John Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott: The majority of structural improvement in the operations.
Frank Hermance: That’s exactly right.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Yes, good morning. Frank, just on that last comment, the $48 million of the $80 million is cost savings due to your sourcing initiatives. How was that kind of a variable cost savings? How was it possible to bump up your sourcing cost savings in a weaker market? Is this just basically going back to vendors and asking for concessions on pricing?
Bob Mandos: I would say; this is Bob Mandos. It’s a combination of utilizing our global procurement organization and continuing to drive into low cost regions, our sourcing strategy and we have really a top level strategy there to continually drive year-in and year-out that incremental savings in low cost regions. So we clearly continue to expand in China, but we’re looking at other parts of the world, whether it’d be other parts of Asia, Eastern Europe et cetera. Additionally we focus on the value-add, value engineering aspect of it throughout the whole company and particularly on the differentiated size of businesses and continually to drive our organization is a key metric for cost improvement.
Frank Hermance:  Then I’ll add, the other piece is just the MRO material that we procure, lights and just the various things to keep our operations. There is tremendous leverage in terms of accumulating our total spend across the whole company of those MRO type items and just continuing to drive cost. We’ve had substantial improvements in things like FedEx cost by amalgamating our part volumes and for some of our plants, we buy chemicals and again if you can amalgamate that volume, you have leverage with your customers. So this is just relentless, continuous and Bob and his organization who drive this have done a really, really great job.
Bob Mandos: And the other point I’d just make on acquisitions. We continue to drive our strategy, our sourcing strategy to our new acquisitions. You’ve heard us talk about operational excellence and how that’s core competency for us, while we drive that into the newly acquired companies and generate synergy through that mechanism.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: So the larger the acquisitions, as they flow in, driving your value engineering, but probably more important the sourcing piece can get you an inflating number of cost savings?
Frank Hermance: Exactly.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Yes, can I also ask on the EIG business in the quarter, did the acquisitions contribute as expected from a revenue perspective? I would have heard the…
Frank Hermance: (inaudible).
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Okay, that’s not a little bit light or anything?
Frank Hermance: No, maybe a hair but not significantly. It was pretty close to what we said. We gave guidance and we were very close to our guidance. We said low double digits and we were at 12%.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Yes, just the mix of between the acquisition. It looked like - okay. And then just one quick question on the margin line. If I look at the EMG margins, did Dunker contribute approximately their penny for the quarter?
Frank Hermance: Yes they did, but they did what we they were going to do but the impact on margins was actually dilutive and it was dilutive about 100 basis points. So that 20 basis point improvement that you saw was really, if you exclude Dunker, it was 120 basis points. So we were able to outperform based on our cost activities et cetera.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Yes, because again, using our estimates if I look at EMG and I pull out the Dunker contribution, and again you made maybe $5 million of core profit on a sales decline. Is that primarily the cost reductions coming through?
Frank Hermance: Absolutely Rick, and that’s why my comment before that almost can’t look at contribution margins because it really comes down to getting the cost out of these businesses and I think we have done a superb job of that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Frank, going back to the margin question, looking at it a different way, gross margins seems to have had just an internal step up the past year then even from the year before. Can you relate how much is due your core operating improvements versus, are you buying business that at the heart of them, once you really get them integrated have higher gross margins and a lot of your legacy business and should they continue to improve over the time as you make more acquisitions?
Frank Hermance: Yes, you hit it right on the head, absolutely. As we look to buy businesses, we look for businesses that inherently have this high level of differentiation that I have talked about for many years and if you look at the dynamics of those businesses, by definition they have higher gross margins. So as we have moved the company from a sort of our cost-driven legacy businesses, which have low gross margins, the overall gross margin of the company has improved. So what you’re seeing is definitely a function of the inherent capability of the businesses but then of course we make improvements in these businesses and you’re seeing that flow through this as well. So you really focused on a point that’s at the heart of our strategy.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Is it possible to get another point on gross margin improvement in 2013?
Frank Hermance: Yes. Well, 2013, I’m not going to give any guidance for 2013. We will do that in January, but if you asked me is there any possibility to get another point, definitely.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: (inaudible) volumes right?
Frank Hermance: Yes, right, exactly. Well, I think that’s definitely possible, but I don’t want to put a timeframe on it until we roll up our budgets and I’ll some guidance on that in January or February whenever we release earnings.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Okay. And then finally how big is China these days for you and how did China perform since (ph) December?
Frank Hermance: China did well for us. If you look at our total Asia sales, they were about 19% of our company and China in rough numbers is half of that. And they performed, not as strong as it had a year and half ago when we were seeing organic growth rates out of China that were 20% plus but we are now more in that single digit category. But again if you look at it from a worldwide basis it’s surely stronger than the U.S. and we are going to continue to invest in that part of the world. Just another statistic, if you look at our BRIC countries and sort of take that slice, they were up about, I remember right about 12% in the quarter and very importantly, the margins in our BRIC countries is about equivalent to our overall company margin. So, we are not going into these areas by essentially competing on lower price and getting lower margins. We’re able to get our margins in those parts of the world and enjoy the growth. So even though China, I guess they just came out with this 7.4% GDP growth in the second quarter, it’s not what it was, but it’s still pretty good and we’re going to continue to invest there.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Matt McConnell - Citigroup: I’d like to just come back to Aero real quick, which has been really strong especially, relative to what some of your peers have been reporting, and especially on the military side. So is there anything that you can point to in either new products or platforms or share gains and maybe talk about sustainability of that growth into 2013 for Aero?
Frank Hermance: Yes, the second part of your question is a difficult one but let me take the first part and we have decided and have made investments in areas where the basic growth of the DOD budget is larger in those niche areas than the base budget itself and those areas are basically helicopters. We started literally 10 or 12 years ago to invest in helicopters and that’s a very strong area. Again, that niche is outpacing the base DOD budget, that’s predominately on the EIG side. On the EMG side, we’ve made substantial investments in cooling where we are basically the company to do cooling of electronics on military aircraft or military ground-based vehicles or even military operations where we go into certain bases and we’ll basically upgrade the electronics that they use for radar and things of that nature. And as a result again, that area is outgrowing the base DOD budget. So we’re enjoying some of that growth. The second part of your question is much more difficult and that comes to the question of sequestration and what is going to happen. Your prediction is probably better than mine but I’ll tell you what my best guess is on sequestration, which actually the President last night had some comments that would support what I’m going to say. The way sequestration is put in to effect makes absolutely no sense, because basically you have to go down every line item of the budget and reduce that line item. It essentially gives no degree of flexibility to the people who are making those decisions. So if we are going to in and make substantial changes, whether it’s on the military side or the nonmilitary side, you want to give the people that are in power the ability to make the decisions, versus this sort of line item approach. So if you step back and say that’s just unrealistic, I think the more logical thing is it’s going to be very difficult. I think they get in agreement between the election and January. So my best call would be that what will happen is Congress will pass something that will delay this six months or nine months and they will try to battle out an agreement that make sense and give our people basically some discretion and I think wherever it ends up, we will outperform it. So if you look at these numbers, even take the worst case on sequestration, you’re talking about 6% - 7% kind of decline a year. Obviously this isn’t going to be a high growth part of our business, but we also don’t think it’s going to be some major problem. If you look at our total military spending it’s on the order of 10% or 11% of AMETEK and a good part of that is outside the U.S. and it wouldn’t be even impacted by sequestration. So that’s a long answer to your question but it’s obviously a difficult question with what’s going on.
Operator: Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies Capital. Please proceed.
Scott Graham - Jefferies Capital: My question has been answered. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird, please proceed.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Yes, Frank, can I just ask you, on Aerospace; the commercial and regional pieces of your Aerospace business typically, I believe are in EIG and the question I had, can you just repeat how those did in the quarter? I know you said they were particularly strong but is that plus mid-single digits or mid-double digits, excuse me.
Frank Hermance: Yes, it was more in the 10% kind of area for those two parts and so they were very, very strong.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: I know when we travelled a while back and I think your comment, you did a nice job of kind of laying out some meaningful content gains on both; primarily on the regional side but I think on the commercial side and would you attribute a portion, say half of that growth to content gains on various aircraft or how would you characterize the content benefit?
Frank Hermance: Yes, it’s a great question and in reality on the commercial side, it is right now more driven my market dynamics, where if you look at the number of planes that are being produced by Boeing and Airbus, this year they are going to be up about 17%. Each are producing around 600 aircraft in the year and that trend is going to continue and actually increase. As you mentioned, on the business and regional jet, the market dynamics there are not the greatest right now. Actually they are kind of bouncing a long bottom but there we have definitely won some major content on, in particular Gulfstream aircraft which is driving our growth. So that in the short term is content wins. Now let me come back to the commercial side because the way we view it is the long term future of our commercial business is dependent on the new aircraft and so we have made substantial investments in those new aircraft and I’ll just give you a few numbers Rick to put some flavor on it. If we look at 350, actually I just read this morning that they opened a new plant in Toulouse, France for the 350. That is going to be our largest content airplane. It’s going to have a ship set value of about $150,000 and over a 10 year period we are going to get about $380 million of revenue from that. So that’s going to be a very strong aircraft for us. The 380, obviously not as many aircraft, but that’s going to have about $66 million of content over that same period. The 787 is going to be about $220 million. The content value there will be lower per aircraft, about 85 and just to jump for a moment, another very large content aircraft for us, which speaks of the future of the military business is the Joint Strike Fighter, where we have about 140,000 of content and that will be about $600 million, but that’s over the life of that program, not 10 years. So the point I’m trying to make and just put the military aside for a minute is that for commercial the short term is more market driven, but the long term is content driven and for business and regional jet the short term is more content driven, but in the longer term will be more market driven.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Got it, okay. That one was a tongue twister.
Operator:  And there appear to be no further questions. At this time I’ll turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.

Frank S. Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, we established records for orders, operating income, operating margins, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Orders in the second quarter were a record at $916 million, up 15% from the prior year. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.11. Sales in the second quarter were up 9% to $825.9 million. Internal growth was flat due to a weak international environment, while acquisitions added 10% and currency was a 1% headwind. Excluding the cost-driven motor business, which was impacted by weakness in Europe and the impact of a very difficult comparison in Asia, our internal growth was 3% in the quarter. Operating income for the second quarter was superb. It increased 18% to a record $185 million from $157 million last year, reflecting the impact from our operational excellence activities and our longer cycle, higher-margin businesses. Operating income margin in the quarter was a record at 22.4%, a 170 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2011. Net income was up 21% to $113.7 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.47 were up 21% over last year’s second quarter and above the top end of our prior guidance of $0.45. Both net income and diluted earnings per share were records.  Backlog at the end of the second quarter was over $1 billion, an all-time record high. Working capital management was excellent, operating working capital was 17.7% of sales. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups, the electronic instruments group had a solid second quarter. Sales were up 11% to $452.1 million on strength in our aerospace, oil and gas, and power instruments businesses in addition to the contributions from the acquisitions of O’Brien, TMC, EM Test, and Reichert Technologies. Internal growth was 1% while acquisitions added 12% and currency reduced sales by 2%. EIG’s operating income increased 16% to $117.7 million and operating margins were very strong at 26%, up 110 basis points over last year’s second quarter. The electromechanical group also had a good quarter. Sales were up 6% to a record $373.8 million on strength in our differentiated businesses and the contributions from the acquisitions of Avicenna, Coining, and Dunkermotoren. Internal growth was down 1%. Acquisitions added 8%, and foreign currency reduced sales by 1%. ENG’s operating income increased 14% to $78.8 million, a record level, and operating margins increased 140 basis points to a record 21.1%. I’d like to provide some perspective on the broader macroeconomic environment and what impact we are seeing on our business. We did see weakening in our business during the second quarter, in particular in Europe and Asia. Sales trends softened as customers turned cautious and delayed or pushed out shipments. Our process businesses, with approximately 70% of sales outside the U.S., had been impacted by the slowing as well as our cost-driven motors business, given its sizable European exposure. We now expect 2012 organic sales growth to be up low to mid-single digits versus our previous guidance of mid-single digits. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will tighten our belts and aggressively manage our costs through this period of softness, while continuing to make investments in strategic acquisitions, market expansion, and new product development initiatives. In particular, our deal pipeline is strong and we will remain active in acquiring businesses. We have put in place a number of cost containment actions across our businesses, which will benefit the second half of 2012. These actions, the contributions from acquired businesses, and the continued strength in our aerospace and oil and gas businesses have allowed us to increase our guidance for the year. Focusing now on our four growth strategies of operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development, and acquisitions. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our continual focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. The results we announced today reflect the impact of our various operational excellence initiatives as we were able to expand operating margins by 170 basis points to a record 22.4%. At the beginning of the year, we targeted $60 million in cost savings from our various operational excellence initiatives, which include Lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office operations, design for Six Sigma and our new product development efforts, movement of our production to low-cost locales, and global sourcing and strategic procurement. Approximately $40 million of these cost savings were targeted from global sourcing and strategic procurement initiatives. Given the softening we are seeing, we have increased our cost savings for 2012 from $60 million to $75 million. We are prepared to take further actions if necessary.  Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK’s growth. In the second quarter of 2012 international sales represented 50% of our total sales. We continue to make investments in global and market expansion initiatives. The following are some examples of recent successes. AMETEK Power Instruments was awarded an order for the supply of pressure transmitters for compressor surge applications in Russia. In compressor surge applications, the speed of response from the transmitter is critical, and therefore highly valued by the customer. Our pressure transmitter solution was ideally suited for this differentiated power application. This order represents Power Instruments’ initial win in the local Russian marketplace. Our Singapore MRO Aerospace business had a number of positive developments in the second quarter, including formally obtaining their Chinese CAAC repair station certification. This repair station certification allows us to provide repair services in support of Chinese aircraft operators, repair stations, and logistics suppliers. It also provides us broader access to the Asian aerospace repair market and further broadens the footprint of our global MRO operation. In addition, our Singapore MRO business added a number of new repair capabilities, including helicopter, hydraulic servos, oxygen components, and aircraft brakes. This expanded set of repair capabilities allows us to provide our customers a wider range of MRO services. Lastly, it’s worth noting that sales from our Singapore MRO business were up 42% in the second quarter of 2012, reflecting the tremendous work our global MRO team has done in establishing and growing their presence in this region.  New product development is a key to our long term health and growth. We’ve consistently invested in RD&E. In 2012 we expect to spend $155 million, a 13% increase over 2011. We’re excited about some recent new product introductions. Our CAMECA business launched the IMS 7f-Auto, the latest evolution of their highly successful secondary ion mass spectrometer. This product measures the elemental composition of materials.  The IMS 7f-Auto provides improved throughput for fully automated microanalysis, significantly increased the productivity of the lab environment and accelerating results. Product features ensure a high precision measurement, long term stability, and ease of use, thus enhancing the overall tool productivity. Performance of the IMS 7f-Auto is optimized for challenging applications such as glass, metal, ceramics, silicon-based devices, and both bulk materials and thin films. Also in the second quarter, AMETEK Solid State Controls launched a new global uninterruptible power supply system called Digital Process Power 2. This system provides clean, regulated power for critical AC loads, and was designed for global process control and industrial applications. This new product opens up additional global market opportunities for our solid state controls business as it meets all global operating compliance standards. It complements the vast UPS product family of solid state controls and represents over $10 million in annual sales opportunity. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 23% of sales in the second quarter versus 21% in last year’s second quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. Turning our attention to acquisitions, we had a very successful first half of 2012, with the acquisitions of O’Brien in the first quarter and Dunkermotoren in the second quarter. We deployed nearly $500 million on these two acquisitions and acquired approximately $280 million in revenue. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2012 and beyond, as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value, especially given the weakness in the global economy. Our pipeline of deals remains robust, with an attractive mix of acquisition candidates, with a variety of sizes and markets and geographic concentrations. Our balance sheet is strong, our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity, and we have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisitions focus. Turning now to the outlook for 2012, we expect our longer cycle aerospace, oil and gas, and power businesses to show continued strength throughout the balance of the year. We anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis from 2011. Organic growth is expected to be up low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2012 are now expected to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.85 per diluted share, up 16-17% over 2011. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $1.80 to $1.83 per diluted share. Third quarter 2012 sales are expected to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis from last year’s third quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.45 to $0.46 per diluted share, up 13-15% over last year’s third quarter. Our record backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well for the remainder of 2012. So in summary, our overall businesses performed well in the second quarter. We are taking the necessary actions to ensure our cost structure is aligned with the slowing global economic environment. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. Before turning the call over to our new chief financial officer, Bob Mandos, to cover the financial details, I wanted to take a moment and acknowledge and thank our long term chief financial officer, John Molinelli, who retired on July 1. John had a highly successful 43-year career at AMETEK, the last 18 of which were as our chief financial officer. On behalf of everyone at AMETEK, I want to thank John for his outstanding contributions to the company over a long and distinguished career, and for the integral role he had in our company’s success. We wish John all the best in his retirement.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Bob Mandos as our new chief financial officer. Bob has been with AMETEK for 31 years. Prior to being named CFO, Bob served as corporate comptroller since 1996. In this role, Bob was a key member of the senior management team and worked very closely with me, John Molinelli, and our group presidents in developing and executing our growth strategies and ensuring the veracity and quality of our financial information and financial reporting systems.  In addition, Bob led the successful expansion of our corporate shared service operation and led the financial due diligence process for our acquisition strategy. Bob has done an outstanding job for AMETEK over a long period of time, and is uniquely qualified to take on the chief financial officer role. We wish Bob all the best in his new role.  And with that introduction, let me turn it over to Bob to cover some of the financial details.
Bob Mandos: Thanks, Frank. As Frank noted, we had a strong second quarter, with excellent financial performance and a high quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. Growth in selling expenses was in line with growth in sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.4% of sales, below last year’s second quarter level of 1.8% of sales, driven by the accelerated stock vesting in last year’s second quarter and lower consulting spend this quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.8%, down from last year’s second quarter rate of 31.4%. We anticipate a tax rate of between 30% and 31% for the full year of 2012. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 17.7% of sales in the second quarter, essentially in line with last year’s second quarter, reflecting the continued efforts of our teams to reduce our investment here. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority.  Capital spending was $12 million for the quarter. Full year 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $60 million. Depreciation and amortization was $26 million for the quarter. 2012 depreciation and amortization is estimated to be approximately $108 million. In the quarter, operating cash flow was $116 million, and free cash flow was $104 million. Operating cash flow in the first half of 2012 was $257 million, up 17% from the first half of 2011, and free cash flow was $236 million for the first half of 2012, representing 105% of net income. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income.  Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy, where we expended approximately $500 million in the first half of 2012. Total debt was $1.51 billion at June 30, up $248 million from year end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $164 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at June 30 of 37%, up from 35% at the end of 2011. At June 30, we had approximately $655 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.  In summary, we had a solid second quarter, establishing records for essentially all the key operating metrics. We are well-positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows. 
Frank S. Hermance: Great, thank you Bob. That concludes our prepared remarks. We’ll now open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. 
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo: Frank, you talked about aerospace being strong for you, but we’re certainly hearing concerns about the aftermarket on the commercial side. Could you give any color around that, and what you’re seeing there specifically? 
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, actually our aftermarket business is doing quite well. We had very strong performance in the second quarter, and we actually are expecting that to continue. I know that some other companies have been talking about, in particular in Europe, their aftermarket business being weak. So I took an extra special look at that, and in fact our business is good. We are gaining share in that part of the world, and as a result even though the economy is a little bit weaker, it looks pretty good. So we’re forecasting for this entire year it’s going to be up high single-digits organically for the year or so. We feel pretty good about it. 
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo: Great. And then obviously margins have been spectacular, and you’ve been outpacing what you sort of guided to at the beginning of the year. In addition, more cost savings coming out. How should we be thinking about margins as we head to the back of the year here for you guys? 
Frank S. Hermance: In the last conference call we had raised guidance up to 40 basis points for the full year and we’re conservatively now saying up 60 basis points. So the margins have just been spectacular in the company and our operating people are doing just a first class job in terms of managing their P&L. So we’re very pleased with that, and we’re pleased that we’re able to raise that guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of R. Scott Graham with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with your question. 
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company : The question I just had for you, Frank, is the typical synopsis across both segments, really, just kind of by market, how you typically do that. 
Frank S. Hermance: Let’s start with aerospace. Our overall aerospace continued to performance very well in the second quarter. We had double digit organic sales growth, essentially on broad-based strength across all parts of our aerospace business. We expect to see continued solid growth for aerospace in 2012 as trend in order rates, OEM build rates, revenue passenger miles, and our program wins really support strong commercial third-party MRO and also business and regional jet sales. Surprisingly, our military business also performed well in the second quarter and that’s two quarters now in a row where it essentially has outperformed.  So if we look for all of 2012, we are expecting our commercial and third-party MRO businesses to be up high single-digits. We expect our business in regional jets to be up low double-digits. And our military business is now expected to be up low single digits. So for overall aerospace, we should be up organically in that mid to high single-digits, and we’re obviously trending more toward the higher single digits now.  Moving on to our process businesses, our process businesses performed well in the second quarter, with sales up low double-digits. Our oil and gas business continued to show sizable strength while our advanced measurement technology division was also very strong. Overall growth benefited from the Reichert Technologies, TMC, and O’Brien acquisitions while organic growth was flat in the quarter due to weak international performance. Business remains solid in the U.S. for our process businesses. And for all of 2012, we expect this business to grow low double-digits on a percentage basis overall with low to mid single digit organic growth. In particular we expect continued strong performance from our later cycle oil and gas business. Moving to the power and industrial part of EIG, overall second quarter sales were up high single-digits, driven by the contribution from the EM Test acquisition. Our power instruments and industrial businesses showed particular strength with core growth of high single-digits for power instruments and mid-teens for industrial. Core growth of our programmable power division was negative due to large sales last year to a major semiconductor company. For all of 2012, we expect sales for power and industrial to be up low double-digits overall and mid-single digits organically, driven by the balanced growth that I mentioned across power and industrial. So if you sum up all of EIG, we expect 2012 sales to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis with organic growth of low to mid single digits.  For EMG, I’ll start with the differentiated part of EMG. This part of the company performed well. Overall sales were up low double-digits in Q2 while organic sales were up low single digits. Strong growth from our third-party MRO and military businesses, along with the contributions from Avicenna technology, Coining, and Dunkermotoren. Those acquisitions really drove the overall growth. For 2012, we expect this business to be up approximately high teens overall, with organic growth of mid-single digits.  And the last part of the company, our legacy business, cost-driven motors, sales were down organically mid teens in the second quarter due to weakness in Europe. About 50% of our cost-driven motors business is in Europe. We believe the organic growth will improve in the second half, of the cost-driven motor business, and therefore for 2012 we expect sales to be down about mid-single digits over 2011. So if you sum these two parts of EMG, for all of EMG we expect overall sales to be up low double-digits and organic growth to be up low to mid single digits. And for the company, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we expect low double-digit sales growth on a percentage basis with organic growth of low to mid single digits, which is down a bit from our guidance of mid-single digits previously in terms of organic growth for the company, reflecting obviously the weaker international marketplace. And in essence, the first half organic growth rate will about equal the second half organic growth rate that’s in our forecast.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: I had a question about the organic growth. It looks like you’re looking for a pickup versus the Q2 rates. I’m just wondering how the comps play there. It sounded like you had a little bit of a lumpy comp in the second quarter. And maybe by segment, same question. 
Frank S. Hermance: Definitely we had a somewhat difficult comp in the second quarter. It was predominantly in Asia on the comp. We had very strong sales last year to multiple semiconductor customers and also the Fukushima situation last year caused us to have high sales in the particular quarter. Some of that will spill over into the third quarter, but we expect the third quarter to be essentially low single digits in terms of organic growth and we expect the fourth quarter to be mid-single digits. And there is an easier comparison in the fourth quarter. So that’s why we feel the second half organics will be about the same as the first half organics. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: And then nice to see the pickup in the vitality index to 23%. Some companies, lower specification than you, cite a little bit higher rate there. Maybe they define it differently, obviously, but just wondering if maybe you think you use a stricter budgeting process for returns on new products? 
Frank S. Hermance: Right. It’s a great question, and when we first instituted this vitality index, we tried to come up with a common definition of what a new product is across the company. And it was extremely difficult to do, because we have such a variety of different businesses, some very short cycle, some very long cycle. So what we ended up doing is saying to each of our operating entities, you decide on the definition, but you can’t change it. So therefore, I would rely more on the relevance change in our vitality index versus the absolute level of it. And I can tell you, we’ve kept this definition over the last 10 years, and when we started measuring it, it was at a 10% level. This 23% level, I believe, is a record high. Bob is shaking his head yes. I don’t recall one this high. And the key point is it was up from 21% in last year’s second quarter. So we’re definitely getting a lot more productivity out of the engineering dollar that we’re spending. We feel we’re spending the right amount in terms of percent of sales, and so we’re really focused on the productivity of that dollar, which this vitality index is an indicator of. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: So it sounds like, given the margin upside, you’re not intent on liberalizing the budget? 
Frank S. Hermance: You mean going with more in terms of new product development expense? Is that what you mean? 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Yes. 
Frank S. Hermance: My guess is we will see that inch up as the year goes on. And we’ll see how the third quarter feels, and we probably will inch that up some. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: And just lastly, with the softer environment, seeing any impact on the pace of individual deal negotiations? 
Frank S. Hermance: This is the first time I can say - or maybe I said it in the last conference call - for a number of quarters prior to this, I had not been feeling that pricing was showing a downward trend. And I’m starting to feel that now. I’m feeling deals are more reasonable. We did close the Dunkermotoren deal at 8x trailing in the second quarter. The O’Brien deal in the first quarter was 9x trailing. So I think there is some reaction to the slowing. I probably don’t have enough data points to fully quantify it, but it just feels a bit better now than what it has.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : Frank, maybe you can just kind of walk us through the geographies - U.S., Europe, Asia, BRIC countries - and sort of what you observed in organic growth this quarter? 
Frank S. Hermance: It’s an interesting picture. The U.S. was fine. It was up in the 2-3% kind of region. The European organic growth was actually flat, but there’s a difference between the various parts of the business, where on the EMG side of the business, Europe was - the floor care motor business, as I mentioned in some of my opening remarks - very, very weak. And that drove the organic growth of EMG down.  For the company, in Asia it was actually our weakest performance. That was down 5%. But that was due to the factors that I mentioned in terms of the very tough comparisons to last year. So as I said, I think those organic growths will show an improving trend through the second half. But actually Asia was the worst, which is I think the first time I can remember Asia having the worst organic growth rate in the company in a long, long time. So there’s definitely some softening going on there, but more so than that, it was a tough comparison. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : And then how about the rest of the BRIC regions? How did those perform? 
Frank S. Hermance: They performed okay. China, obviously, is the largest part of our BRIC region. Russia was strong. Brazil was okay. They were fine. China is the driver here. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : And I think you mentioned some international process softness as well. Is that speaking to the Asian observation there that you mentioned? 
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, that is correct. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets : And then maybe you can just talk a little bit in more detail on kind of what the initiatives are on the cost containment side that are getting you that extra $15 million this year? 
Frank S. Hermance: Basically, we have increased substantially the amount of savings we’re going to get in the procurement activities that we have. So we’re going to go up another, say, half of that $15 million is the result of sourcing activities. The remaining half is a combination of some targeted reduction in forces, and some belt-tightening across the company.  We’re reacting in a manner that’s consistent with a sort of slowing of the top line. We’re not feeling that we’re going to have some major issue on the top line, but we just decided - and I think you know our culture quite well here - that we tend to react as soon as we see softening, so we decided to react and put these in place. And we’re going to watch the business. If things soften more, then we will take some more significant actions to ensure the profitability of the company. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of D. Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed. 
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : What is the payables number? 
Bob Mandos: $300 million. 
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : Frank, you were talking about the M&A environment and prices coming down, but with that, are you also taking down what you’re willing to pay for deals as well? Is there still kind of a disconnect, or not? 
Frank S. Hermance: No, I’m feeling relatively comfortable with the multiples, where they are now. And what we were doing when I felt some of the deals were a bit higher than we wanted to pay is we were parsing the deals to acquire those companies where we had more than the norm of cost synergies in those businesses. So we always keep the same return type of metrics, irrespective of what the pricing is. So the fact that they’re lower now, a little bit, in terms of the sales price, we’ll probably get better returns on those deals. 
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : And then you said the book-to-bill was 1.11? 
Frank S. Hermance: Yes.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : That’s pretty strong. How were those orders splitting, say, between Q3 and Q4? Is a lot of that baked into Q4? Some longer cycle businesses? 
Frank S. Hermance: Yeah. I mean, a good part of that increase was due to backlog that we acquired from Dunkermotoren. Because that was a fairly large deal. And obviously when you acquire the backlog, it goes into the order number. So there was a sizable piece due to that deal. And that will ship in Q3 and in Q4, with stronger sales in Q4 than in Q3. 
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research : So can you back out what was the organic book to bill? 
Frank S. Hermance: It was roughly the same as sales. It was roughly flat for the same reasons we talked about.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please proceed. 
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Frank, I was wondering if you could spend a couple additional moments talking about some of the other end markets outside of oil and gas and semiconductor in the process group of businesses, what you’re seeing domestic, internationally. You typically parse it into maybe four or five buckets. Can you do that? 
Frank S. Hermance: Are you talking about the process businesses in particular? 
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Yes, the process piece only, really. 
Frank S. Hermance: Well, if you look at the breakdown of that business, about a third is in oil and gas, about 25% is in instrumentation related to metals, about 20% is in research and sort of development kinds of applications, and then the remaining whatever it is, 22%, is just in a varied number of industries. And obviously the third that was oil and gas remained very, very strong in the quarter. If you look at the number of worldwide rigs it’s around 3,500, which is near an all-time high. We’re impervious to whether it’s oil or gas rigs, as long as people are drilling. So we think that segment is going to continue to do fine.  The part of the business that’s linked to metals has a very large portion of their business in international and as a result it was weaker. And it went in the opposite direction from an organic viewpoint to the oil and gas business. And the research environment was mixed. We had some parts that were very, very strong, some parts that weren’t. But the key driver to the process business is the fact that 70% of those businesses are outside the U.S., and that’s where we’re seeing the weakness, and that’s also where we have the tough comparison. 
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: As you progressed through the quarter, did your organic book-to-bill change much from month to month? I guess I’m trying to get a feel for where your rate entering the quarter would have been versus exiting. 
Frank S. Hermance: Actually, it’s going to be a little contrary to what you’re probably expecting the answer to this question to be, in that it actually increased during the quarter. It was the lowest in the first month and it went up for the second two months, and was about the same in the second and the third month in the quarter.
Operator: [Operator instructions.] And our next question comes from the line of Richard C. Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. 
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Frank, just to do the quick math on the core orders growth rate, it looks like it was up maybe 3% or 4%. Is that the right math? 
Frank S. Hermance: It was a little weaker than that. It wasn’t up quite 3-4%. 
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird: And when you look at that book-to-bill, just in general, excluding Dunker, does your backlog also favor the fourth quarter? Is that how we get that kind of mid single digit four?
Frank S. Hermance: It definitely favors the fourth quarter. In particular, our fourth quarter in aerospace is always our strongest quarter, and as you know the backlog in aerospace has the longest cycle to it. So there’s definitely a preponderance, or a larger percentage, of that backlog that will ship in the fourth quarter. And as I said before, in fairness on the organic side, the fourth quarter also has some lower comps on, in particular, the floor care motor business. 
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird: And then also, is price, just generally speaking, holding up? I know when we entered this year, we felt that we could be fairly aggressive on price given our growth assumptions or our outlook at that time. Is price at least holding up? Or are there any of the businesses starting to require you to price a little more aggressively for the volumes? 
Frank S. Hermance: Pricing is okay. It was up in that 1-2 point region. So price is still okay. We’re not seeing any substantial change in the pricing environment. That could change over the next couple quarters, but right now it looks okay.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.

Frank S. Hermance: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an excellent first quarter. We established quarterly records for orders, sales, operating income -- operating margins, net income and diluted earnings per share.  Sales in the first quarter were up 15% to $827.2 million. Internal growth was strong at 6%, while acquisitions added 10% and currency was a 1% headwind.  Operating income for the first quarter was superb. It increased 20% to $182.8 million from $152 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our Operational Excellence initiatives. Operating income margin in the quarter was a record at 22.1%, a 90-basis-point improvement over the first quarter of 2011. Net income was up 22% to $110.2 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.68 were up 21% over last year's first quarter.  Orders in the first quarter were a record $863 million, up 8% overall from the prior year. Sequentially, orders were up 15%. The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.04.  Cash flow was very strong. Operating cash flow was $141 million, up 36% over last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was $132 million, or 120% of net income. Working capital management was excellent. Operating working capital was 17.2% of sales.  Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had a great first quarter. Sales were up 21% to a record $468.8 million on strength in our Aerospace and Process businesses. In addition, we had strong contributions from the 4 acquisitions that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and in January of 2012. Internal growth was strong at 9%, while currency reduced sales by 1%. EIG's operating income increased 23% to a record $123 million, and operating margins were a very strong at 26.2%, up 50 basis points over last year's first quarter.  The Electromechanical Group also had a very good quarter. Sales were up 9% to $358.3 million on strength in our differentiated businesses and the contributions from the acquisitions of Avicenna and Coining. Internal growth was 3%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency reduced sales by 1%. EMG's operating income increased 13% to $70.9 million, a record level, and operating margins increased 70 basis points to 19.8%.  Focusing now on our 4 growth strategies of Operational Excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and acquisitions. Operational Excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our focus on costs and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. Operational Excellence has many facets within our company, including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office operations, design for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts and a movement of production to low-cost locales. We also continued to drive lower costs through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. From these sourcing activities, we recognized approximately $10 million in savings in the first quarter and are conservatively estimating $40 million in savings for all of 2012. Our continued focus on these Operational Excellence efforts were key drivers in achieving the record operating margin of 22.1% in the first quarter.  Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK's growth. In the first quarter of 2012, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. Organic growth in Asia was very strong in the first quarter, up mid-teens on a percentage basis over the first quarter of 2011. Growth in Europe was also strong, up mid-single digits organically in the quarter. Sales growth in the BRIC regions was excellent, at 20%, reflecting the impact from the investments we've made over the last several years.  As an example of global and market expansion, AMETEK's Power Instruments business was recently awarded a contract to provide fault recorders and distributed alarm management systems to a high-speed rail project in Saudi Arabia. Our products will provide complete transient disturbance, trend and alarm management of all substation events, providing realtime indications of issues and high-resolution postmortem analysis in the event of a fault. The initial contract is for support of the first 2 phases of this rail project. We expect more orders to follow in additional phases. The total expected value for this project is approximately $3.5 million.  New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We've consistently invested in RD&E. In 2012, we expect to spend $155 million, a 13% increase over 2011. We're excited about some recent new program wins driven by our R&D efforts and engineering capabilities. AMETEK Aerospace and Defense has been selected by Snecma to provide heat exchangers and sensors for the LEAP-1A and leap-1C engines being developed for the Airbus A320neo and the COMAC C919 -- that's a Chinese aircraft. AMETEK Hughes Treitler will supply low drag surface coolers to cool variable frequency generator oil and also main engine oil, while AMETEK Measurement and Power Systems will supply the sensors for these engines. The combined contract value is estimated to exceed $175 million over the life of the program. These awards are great examples of AMETEK's success in winning additional content on key aerospace growth platforms through our engineering capabilities.  From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last 3 years was 19% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers.  Turning our attention to acquisitions. AMETEK had a very strong year of acquisitions in 2011, deploying nearly $475 million in capital and acquiring approximately $215 million in annual revenue. We're off to a tremendous start in 2012 with the acquisition of O'Brien Corporation in the first quarter, and as we announced this morning, the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Dunkermotoren. With the contemplated acquisition of Dunkermotoren, we will have acquired approximately $280 million in revenue thus far in 2012.  I will discuss the Dunkermotoren acquisition in a moment, but first I wanted to discuss the acquisition of O'Brien, which we completed in January. O'Brien is a leading manufacturer of fluid and gas handling solutions, sample conditioning equipment and process analyzers using critical applications in the process industries worldwide. O'Brien was privately held and has an annual sales of approximately $80 million. The price paid was approximately $175 million. O'Brien's product offering includes pre-insulated tubing bundles, sample conditioning equipment, specialty electropolished tubing for use in high purity applications, instrument enclosures and process analyzers. Its products are used to enable the capture, transport and analysis of liquids, gases, vapors and emissions in challenging process environments such as oil and gas production, refining, petrochemical processing, power generation, pharmaceutical manufacturing and semiconductor fabrication. O'Brien's product lines are both highly differentiated and highly complementary to AMETEK's Process Instrument businesses. Combined with our analytical instrument solutions, AMETEK now can offer its customers a complete solution for all of their process analysis needs. In addition, we expect to leverage the strong customer relationships of the combined businesses and AMETEK's global capability to further extend O'Brien's market reach.  Now, turning to Dunkermotoren. AMETEK announced this morning that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Dunkermotoren, a global leader in highly engineered brush and brushless motion control solutions for a wide range of industrial automation applications. Dunkermotoren is privately held and has expected 2012 sales of approximately EUR 155 million, or about $200 million. The business is headquartered in Bonndorf, Germany, with additional manufacturing locations in China, Serbia and the U.K. Approximately 60% of their sales are outside of Europe. Completion of the acquisition is subject to German government approval, as well as normal closing conditions. We expect to complete the transaction in the second quarter.  This company is an excellent strategic and highly complementary fit with our Precision Motion Control business, and expands our leadership position in niche rotary and linear motion applications. In addition, it broadens our manufacturing capabilities in both Europe and China and greatly expands our presence in key industrial end markets worldwide. We're very excited about the opportunity to acquire such an outstanding company in Dunkermotoren, and we'll provide further information on the business upon completion of the transaction.  Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2012 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We had the managerial and financial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition's focus. Our backlog of deals remain excellent. Our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy.  Turning to the outlook now for 2012. We expect our businesses to continue to show solid growth in 2012 with our longer cycle Aerospace, Oil& Gas and Power businesses showing particular strength. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven Operational Excellence capabilities and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform very well in 2012.  We anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double digits on a percentage basis from 2011. Organic growth is expected to be up mid-single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2012 are now expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.75 per diluted share, up 14% to 16% over 2011, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth and our Operational Excellence initiatives. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $2.65 to $2.70 per diluted share.  Second quarter 2012 sales are expected to be up approximately 10% from last year's second quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.65 to $0.68 per diluted share, up 12% to 17% over last year's second quarter. The estimates provided for the second quarter and the full year do not include any impact from the pending Dunkermotoren acquisition.  John will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions.
John J. Molinelli: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had an outstanding first quarter with excellent financial performance and a high quality of earnings, and I will provide some further details. Core growth and selling expenses in the quarter was in line with core growth and sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.3% of sales, below last year's first quarter level of 1.5% of sales.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.9%, down from last year's first quarter rate of 32.2%. We anticipate a tax rate of between 30% and 31% for the full year of 2012. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate.  On the balance sheet. Working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory, less payables, was 17.2% of sales in the first quarter, down from 18.3% in last year's first quarter, reflecting the continued focus and efforts of our operating teams to reduce our investment here. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority.  Capital spending was $8 million for the quarter. Full year 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $60 million. Depreciation and amortization was $25 million for the quarter. 2012 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $100 million. Our cash flow was very strong in the first quarter. Operating cash flow is $141 million, up 36% over last year's first quarter. And free cash flow was $132 million for the quarter, representing 120% of net income.  Total debt was $1.36 billion at March 31, up $96 million from year end. Expenditures for acquisitions through the first quarter totaled approximately $175 million. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $219 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at March 31, of 34.3%, down from 34.8% at the end of 2011. At March 31, we had approximately $875 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions.  In summary, we had an outstanding first quarter, establishing records for essentially all the key financial metrics. We're well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows. Kevin?
Kevin C. Coleman: Thank you, John. Great. Tara, we're now ready to take some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Barry from UBS.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I know you guys tend to be conservative, but I just was trying to square the revenue guidance, especially for the second quarter. With the order growth and the impact from M&A, I mean, it looks like a significant slowdown from what you did in the first quarter. And I think I can get kind of 6%, 7%, 8% of growth just from the deals you've kind of done already, excluding the one you announced today. So is that just really conservative, is there kind of anything happening in the core growth rate, maybe easing a bit? If you could just talk a little bit about that, it would be great.
Frank S. Hermance: Sure. I'd be glad to do that. First of all, the acquisition that we announced today, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is not included in any of the estimates we provided. Obviously, that deal is not closed at this point, so we did not feel it appropriate to provide any estimates. We did say that it's going to close in the second quarter, but it could close right at the end of the second quarter. We are dependent on German approvals of the government there as well as the normal closing conditions. So when you actually look at the order and the sales guidance we've given you, it's roughly the same as the first quarter. It's not substantially different than the first quarter. We did have very good order intake in the first quarter. A lot of it was in our longer cycle businesses, which are going to tend to shift in the second half of the year. And there are also maybe a tad of conservatism in our estimates.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Could you comment perhaps on what you're seeing in Europe and what the change, if any, has been in that region?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, sure. Europe is an interesting story for us. Overall, our organic growth in Europe was quite good. It was up actually about 7% in the first quarter. And we saw very, very strong performance in our Aerospace businesses. And also one of our companies in France, CAMECA, which makes a very high-end analytic type instrumentation, saw excellent, excellent sales. So those very positive impacts were the drivers for the 7% organic growth. There was some weakness that we saw in our other businesses, but nothing that I would consider sizable at this point in time.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then just finally, I was just wondering if could update us on what your expectations is for EBIT margin expansion? I think at 4Q, you had said about 30 basis points. And I'm sorry if I missed it in your comments, but just given the very strong performance in 1Q, I'm wondering what your thoughts are now for the year.
Frank S. Hermance: No, you're right. You're absolutely right that I didn't say anything in my comments. But, yes, I indicated up 30 basis points in the talk at the end of the year. And we're now estimating, and I would say conservatively, 40 basis points, and hopefully we'll be able to continue to increase that guidance as we go through the year. Obviously, the capability right now and the flow-through in the company is just, just absolutely incredible. The contribution margin in the company in the first quarter was north of 40%, so very, very strong contribution margins. And you couple that with the Operational Excellence activities, where we expect to put about $60 million of cost improvements through the P&L this year, bodes well for margins.
Robert Barry - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes. Yes, especially given the 90 you did in the first quarter.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, exactly.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Going back to Europe, could you give a little more color in terms of what your end market exposure is? Like how big is Aerospace? Does Oil & Gas play any part of that as well?
Frank S. Hermance: You're talking about overall for the company now?
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Well, overall for Europe, yes. AMETEK Europe.
Frank S. Hermance: Oh, for Europe. The overall amount of business that AMETEK has in Europe is about 26% of our total sales. So it's about the right proportion in terms of our market concentration. And that breaks down, roughly 1/3 is in Aerospace & Defense related activities. We have very strong concentration in the Process industries, including Oil & Gas, but not just Oil & Gas. We also have our Ultra Precision Technology (sic) [Technologies] business, which is a part of our European sales. And as I think I've mentioned in previous calls, we also roll up the Middle East into our Europe numbers, although that wasn't really the driver for the excellent core growth we had in the quarter. So it is a mix, but there is good concentration of Aerospace & Defense in our European content. And obviously, Aerospace, and even the Defense portion of Aerospace in Europe, did quite well.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Great. And then going back to the EBIT expansion, the 40 basis points, is there any way to say acquisitions are holding it back by 10 or 20 basis points with the acquisition-related costs?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, actually, I haven't done that calculation, but the deals that we have done recently, and actually, will also include Dunkermotoren, assuming we close it, are very strong margin businesses, so I don't expect a huge amount of dilution. But there will be some, especially as our growth from acquisitions is going to accelerate as the year goes on.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies.
R. Scott Graham - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: So I was just wondering, Frank, if you could do your typical by-division sales sum-up, that would be helpful.
Frank S. Hermance: Sure, I'd be glad to do that. Why don't I start with Aerospace, which had a really, really good first quarter? We had low double-digit organic sales and order growth with really broad-based strength across all parts of that Aerospace business. We expect to see continued growth for our Aerospace business in 2012 as the trends and order rates, OEM build rates and revenue passenger miles really support strong commercial third-party MRO, and also business in regional jet sales. Actually, I was just reading in the Wall Street before I came in to this conference call that Boeing is expecting to increase their production by about 40% by the end of 2014, so a very substantial change there, which obviously is going to be a nice driver for our growth. Right now for all of 2012, we are expecting our commercial and third-party MRO businesses to be up high single digits. Our business and regional jet business should be up low double digits, and that's based more on wins than it is on the actual market for business and regional jets turning around. And then our military business, we're still saying flat, although we did have a fairly strong first quarter and there may be some conservatism in our forecast for the military side of the business. So if you sum up, we're expecting organic growth in the mid to high-single digits for all of 2012 for Aerospace. And obviously, this is one of our higher profit margin businesses. So I think it's going to be a driver to our performance for a quite an extended period of time. Process, our Process markets performed extremely well in the first quarter. Overall sales were up about 25%, and organic sales were up about 10%. Strong growth was evident across most of our businesses. Our Oil & Gas business continue to show sizable strength, while our Material Analysis, Ultra Precision Technology (sic) [Technologies] and also our Advanced Measurement Technology division were very strong. In addition, we had the benefits from the Reichert Technologies, TMC and O'Brien acquisitions. For 2012, we're expecting this business to grow mid-teens overall, with mid-single-digit organic growth. And in particular, we expect continued strong performance from our later cycle Oil & Gas businesses. And the last part of EIG, Scott, is Power and Industrial. Overall, Q1 sales were up low double-digits driven by mid-single-digit organic growth and the contribution from the EM Test acquisition that we did last year. For all of 2012, we're expecting sales for Power and Industrial to be up low double-digits overall with mid-single-digit organic growth, and that'll be actually balanced growth between the process and industrial parts of that business. So if you take those discussions and look at EIG overall, for 2012, we're expecting overall sales to be up about mid-teens on a percentage basis and organic growth of mid-single digits. Switching to the other half of the company, in EMG for our differentiated EMG businesses, sales were up low teens in Q1, while organic sales were solid. And they had growth in the mid-single digits organically. We saw strong growth from our third-party MRO businesses and also our military businesses, as I mentioned in the answer to Allison's question. And we also augmented that with the acquisitions of Avicenna Technology and Coining. We're expecting for the differentiated part of EMG for all of 2012 will be up approximately 10% overall with organic growth of mid-single digits. And the last part of our company, which is really the legacy businesses, our cost driven motor business, kind of a mixed story here. Orders were up 10% in the first quarter, but sales were actually down about mid-single digits. And for 2012, we're expecting sales to be roughly flat over 2011. And I think as you know, we don't manage this business for growth. We really manage it very heavily for profitability through our Operational Excellence activities. So if you sum these 2 parts of EMG, we're expecting overall sales for EMG to be up mid to high single digits and organic growth should be in that mid-single digit region. If we get the high-single-digit overall growth, we'll be at the high end of the mid-single digit organically, and vice versa. If it's a little bit weaker, then it will be on the other side. And I think the wildcard there is although we saw good order growth in cost driven motors, it'll be interesting to see how that translates as we go through the year. So if you sum the company up then, as I've said in my opening remarks for AMETEK as a whole, we're expecting low double-digit sales growth on a percentage basis, and organic growth in this mid-single-digit arena.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Frank, just wondering how long you've been looking at Dunkermotoren and if there was a typical cycle time or sort of a unique process.
Frank S. Hermance: That's a great question, Chris. We've probably been looking at this company for 4 to 5 years. It was #1 on the acquisition agenda for our Precision Motion Control business. Our Precision Motion Control business has very strong content in the U.S. and very strong content in Asia but did not have strong content in Europe. And Dunkermotoren basically has a very similar type of approach to the market. They get extremely good margins, and they complement our business just like a glove. So we have remained in contact with this company, actually even through a change in ownership to the present owner. And we actually contacted the owner ourselves, and were able to strike a deal. And we've got a lot of hired people here. I think they signed this deal at about 3:00 or 4:00 this morning. So we're very pleased with it. It's a great business, great complement, as a matter of fact both of these acquisitions. O'Brien and Dunkermotoren are just ideal fits with AMETEK. We understand the businesses. We can improve them, we can leverage them. And I would say, both management teams are also extremely excited about being part of our company. We were their #1 choice in terms of who would acquire them. But yes, it was sort of a long process, but we always hang in there, and it turned out great.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Sounds like maybe you should grab a nap after the call. Wondering also on the acquisition pipeline if you've seen any in the third-party MRO pre-PMA type area.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, that's another question, Chris. Yes, we have. We actually -- over the course of the last couple of years, we've been somewhat quiet on that front. And we actually had a couple of deals that got fairly close to fruition and then didn't happen for one reason or another. But yes, there are some deals in our backlog. That business performed remarkably well in the first quarter. I think you know as we started to roll up these companies, typically these companies have 10% kind of pretax margins because they can't leverage the PMA and DDR capability the way we're able to. And I can tell you that, that total third-party MRO business right now has got to operating margins that are just under 20%, so very sizable improvement. And as well, they were one of our higher growth parts of Aerospace. So we would like to do more transactions here. We've got some backlog, and hopefully you'll be hearing from us in this area.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets.
James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I wanted to follow up on Dunkermotoren here. And when you look at that sitting in the Precision Motion, how big is Precision Motion now for you?
Frank S. Hermance: It's about that same size, so it's -- and this is going to be a sizable increase in that business. So, Bill, look it up and see how close I am in my estimates. Bill's going to look it up, but it's roughly that same size.
James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Well, knowing your track record, you're pretty close, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, Bill says I'm pretty close.
James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay, great. And good color on Europe. BRIC rose up 20%. We've heard a lot of conflicting reports about China in particular. You've been making a lot of investments in Brazil and India. Can you just give us an update on what you're seeing in emerging markets, China in particular?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I can, Jim. There's no question that I can feel some slowing in China, but when you look at slowing from a GDP of 9% to 7%, it's still obviously one of the stronger GDP growths in the world. So we saw very good performance in China. I mentioned the BRIC countries were up about 20% in sales and China was right in that region, and I think it was around 19%. So we were fine. And it will be interesting to see how the year plays out, but largely for us, it's a share gain. So we are getting the growth from share. And it's not as much dictated specifically by the GDPs of that country. India, I did see an article in the Wall Street Journal this morning talking about a potential downgrade from S&P for India, which actually surprised me a bit, but we saw a very good performance in India in the first quarter. It was also right in that same region of about 20% growth. And again, it is largely a share gain for us in India. In Brazil, Brazil was actually a bit weaker for us in the first quarter, but the order growth was really, really super there. And some of that is due to the fact that we have some floorcare motor business down there, and it has not been a favorable climate season for that particular floorcare. I say floorcare, but it's actually in lawn and garden and those types of applications. So that's what drove that. Actually, I was just talk to the group president for our Process businesses, and he said, looking at his businesses down there -- he just spent 3 or 4 days down there -- they're growing very, very rapidly. So a little bit of a mixed bag there, but overall the order growth was good. So I suspect it will be fine for the rest of the year. So I think the best way I can characterize this for us is a little bit of weakening. We're not growing at the same rates that maybe we were last year, but still this is the organic growth engine for us.
James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And 2 housekeeping questions for John. One, I missed D&A for the quarter. And two, payables.
John J. Molinelli: D&A was $25 million, Jim. And payables is $291 million.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: On Dunkermotoren, I just wondered if you have -- is there a purchase price on the deal that you can tell us?
Frank S. Hermance: Well, that's a great question. And we have agreed with the sellers that until we close, we're not going to give a specific number. But I can tell you that this is a typical AMETEK deal. I think you know we don't pay multiples that are double digits. And I think when we do release the final purchase price and the multiples, you'll see this is right in line with a typical AMETEK acquisition.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. It sounds like it might be operating at margins that are slightly higher than EMG today overall.
Frank S. Hermance: Than EMG, you said?
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Right.
Frank S. Hermance: Well, I'm not supposed to be talking about this, but your assumption is a good one.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: You also mentioned that it's a very nice complement. Do you see opportunity for synergies with...
Frank S. Hermance: Oh, yes, absolutely. We see opportunities for synergy. There's going to be cross-selling opportunities where they have a capability that -- and not huge share in the U.S., so they can capitalize on that. Also in the other direction, our U.S.-based businesses can capitalize on their distribution capability. In Europe, we see cost synergies. They have a plant in Serbia, and we spent a lot of time looking at Serbia because it's a part of the world that we had very little exposure to. And that could end up being another low-cost platform for AMETEK. So that's another synergy that we see in this deal. So I think again this will be a normal AMETEK acquisition and that we'll have good synergies, ability to increase profitability. And as I said, that management team and the management team within AMETEK are really excited about this; 2 very strong management teams, and they can't wait to really have this thing closed and start to capitalize on each other's capability.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Great. And you mentioned your segment detail. It doesn't sound like there's any real major change there. Is there any different expectation by geography as you look at the year at this point?
Frank S. Hermance: I would say that maybe the only difference is we probably won't see quite as much growth in China as we were originally hoping for. But offsetting that is our Aerospace businesses are stronger than we had anticipated. So it feels like we're going to end up in the same position, but maybe with a little bit of shift there. But to your opening comment, I don't think it's material. It's not significant.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then one last quick one. On the guidance for 2Q, you're not assuming any Dunkermotoren contribution, but I assume there will be M&A expenses associated with it that you are assuming on the cost side?
Frank S. Hermance: No. I guess we did roll -- we rolled it through already, some of it, didn't we, guys?
John J. Molinelli: Yes.
Frank S. Hermance: We rolled it through already. So there might be a little bit more, but it's actually in the first quarter results. That's when the majority of our costs were done. And there's not going to be any huge restructuring charges, et cetera, as we go forward. As you know, we're very, very conscious about continually not hitting the P&L with these extraneous charges, so don't expect anything substantial from any of these deals as we go forward. And as I said, this is just going to be a typical deal for us.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Couple of questions. Frank, you mentioned your networking capital coming in at 18%, maybe a little bit higher than that, which is down, I believe, over last few years from the low 20s. For a company like AMETEK, looking out over the next 2 to 3 years, what is the right number on your networking capital? Can you get it down into the low teens? And I guess, along those lines, how much incremental cash do you think you can get out of working capital?
Frank S. Hermance: I'll answer the first part, and John can answer the second part. The 17 -- actually what we did in the quarter was 17.2%, and we're fairly comfortable with that kind of number. What actually happens, and it was evident when we put our budget together this year, is that as we acquired companies and bring them into our fold, very few operate at this 17.2% or 17% type of number. So our objective is really to maintain that kind of level as we acquire these companies, which means we have to be continually improving the working capital of those acquired companies. But I don't see our mix of businesses getting down to the low teens. We have some businesses that get there, but not for all of AMETEK. If you recall, we have some businesses like our metals businesses and even our -- some of our other more capital-intensive businesses that do have a bit higher working capital. But we're very pleased at this 17% level. And, John, you might be able to answer to the cash question.
John J. Molinelli: Well, I would take it to just a little bit ingredients [ph] to what you said, Frank. I would -- if you look at 2012, we anticipated a number of this 17.2%, but it's a mixture of our base businesses beating that with the acquisitions that we did last year coming in around 26%. And as we go through the year, that number gets better and better. And then you roll that number, Matt, into 2013, that 26% is going to become maybe close to 20%. And we'll pull cash out of those businesses while we run our base businesses in that 16.5% to 17% range. In the aggregate, we've got some of them that are much better than that. So that's the picture I would paint. But we'd be taking cash out of the acquisitions, getting them into that sweet spot of around 16.5%, 17%, 17.5% from an overall perspective.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: That's very helpful. And then just on the military portion of your business, Frank, you indicated that was up in Q1. What's driving that? And I guess, as we move throughout the year, are there specific content wins that you have that give you confidence that, that business isn't going to slip in terms of revenue or potentially even grow?
Frank S. Hermance: It's a great question. And we were -- at least, I was actually surprised at the strength in the first quarter. It was quite good. And it wasn't just on the sales side. Our order intake was very, very good. And it was particularly good in Europe. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're being a bit conservative as we go forward, but I have no indications that this business is going to become a major drain. I think the question is more how much upside are we going to get out of it and are the first quarter results something that we can repeat through the year. Actually, I was just talking to our group president about this exact thing. And our position is really, we're going to wait another quarter, and we'll see how well it does. And if the order intake is good in the second quarter -- it started out okay in April -- we may be raising our guidance here. But I don't think we're worried about some dramatic negative impact of military. And it is. I mean, to your point, Matt, there is -- we're on some really good platforms, particularly in Europe. And this is a platform type of business, and the dollars are still coming in. So it's going to be a wait and see.
Matt J. Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And then, Frank, in your opening remarks, early on you mentioned that orders organically up year-over-year, sequentially 15 -- or excuse me, in total, do you have the organic numbers for orders?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, organic growth was relatively flat across -- or against a very tough comparison.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: What is the backlog right now?
Frank S. Hermance: $947 million. We're about $800,000 short of a record.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Is the order, what, 911, last quarter?
Frank S. Hermance: I think that's right.
John J. Molinelli: I think that's right.
Frank S. Hermance: I think that's right, and that's, that book-to-bill of 1.04 that I was talking about.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Yes, yes. And then, Frank, did I miss it? Did you talk about what the organic growth rates were in the U.S., North America and then what you're seeing there?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, I'll just give them all to you so you have them. The Far East was 15% organically. As I already mentioned, Europe was 7% organically; The U.S. was about 4% organically.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: So what's -- could you discuss the relative weakness in the U.S. given, actually, that the PMI has been a lot better in the U.S. versus any place else?
Frank S. Hermance: I understand, but I think you've got to almost turn it around and that we had really strong growth in the other parts of the world. The U.S. came in pretty much as we had anticipated, and Europe, for the reasons we've already talked about, came in much stronger than we had, had anticipated. And Asia was a tad weaker. So I don't think it's like we feel there's some problem in the U.S. It's more sort of good news in the other parts of the world, in particular Europe. And I'm probably one of the few CEOs that's talking about good news in Europe.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Right. Well, I guess I would've guessed that U.S. would have been higher, seeing then some other companies that the U.S. is still very strong, but I'm just curious if there was certain parts of the U.S. that's on your products' end markets that were under expectations?
Frank S. Hermance: No, I would say, we had said mid-single digits. So it's pretty much what we expected, pretty much what we expected. And there's nothing of concern or alarm in the U.S. Most of our markets are okay. So, yes, there's nothing that I can comment on to your point.
D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. With Dunkermotoren -- what is their, I guess, it seems sounds like pretty diversified. But with the Precision Motion Company in Germany, is solar big enough to be a concern for them at this point or are they pretty well diversified across the pipeline?
Frank S. Hermance: Just like our business in the U.S., this is a highly diversified business. No key end market, no key customer, very, very diverse. And winning this business based on being able to very rapidly customize motors for a particular application. And there's just no single concentration that you can point to that's going to be an issue for them.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Frank, could you provide just maybe a little bit of color, or John, on the gross margin? When you look at that year-over-year, the 110 bps of improvement, how much of that is driven by your current sales mix and growth in the Aerospace, Process versus acquisition accretion or price? Are you getting some price here in the quarter?
John J. Molinelli: We are getting some price, Richard. We're probably pulling net of inflation of about a little less than 1% through, so that's contributed. But there's so many ingredients that go into that to try to break it down and beyond that. We've got that $10 million of cost savings Frank talked about. That's running ahead of our expectations. Gosh, the mix has been very good. No question about that. So there's probably half a dozen variables that are trending positive.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. But we are seeing the upward buys in the margins from these later cycle, or longer cycle business acceleration.
John J. Molinelli: No question about that. No question about that. I mean...
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: That kind of margin expansion of the gross line is pretty sustainable as long as we're in this -- we stay in this longer cycle mix, [indiscernible] mix.
John J. Molinelli: No question, especially looking out with the Aerospace strength that we see, that has got a very positive contribution to the higher margins.
Frank S. Hermance: We don't actually, in contrast to other businesses that I've been involved in, we don't focus at the gross margin line because the gross margins of our businesses have very wide diversity amongst them. We really focus on the contribution margin and the absolute margin to the bottom line. And just to augment what John said, the contribution margin in our Aerospace businesses is essentially the highest in the company. It's very, very good. So that's why the contribution margin, overall in the quarter, was up above 40%.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: And that -- so overall when I look at the reported incremental, we're more in the high 20s, obviously, influenced by the acquisition contribution and pull down there. But your core incremental for AMETEK was in the low 40s?
Frank S. Hermance: Yes, actually it was even a bit higher than that. But it was really good. But you're absolutely right that when we talk about contribution margin, we exclude the acquisitions because obviously you're not going to get the flow-through to the same level on the acquisitions, so we just extract them. And that's where this 40% plus number comes from.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then just one last question. Frank, when I look at the organic order number, order growth rate or flat growth in orders in the core business, is there anything in the mix of order flow that gives you a better feel or a good feel for your markets? For instance, long cycle, I think had you mentioned long cycle orders, business orders were up. Is there anything on the short cycle side that causes you concern or...
Frank S. Hermance: No, I mean, a part of our short cycle business that we are concerned about is always our cost driven motor business. But obviously, as I mentioned, that part of the business on the order intake was pretty good. This is really -- the fact that we had very, very strong performance last year on orders. And as we were coming sort of up from the depths of the recession, we were swinging back in sort of a V-shaped manner. And some of our order flows in those first couple of quarters last year were just very, very strong. So I'm not looking at anything in that number that is overly concerning to me.

Frank Hermance : Thank you, Kevin. AMETEK had a strong fourth quarter to complete another outstanding year. We established quarterly and annual records for sales, operating income, operating margins, net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating cash flow.  For the full year of 2011, sales were up 21%, operating income was 32%, margins were up 180 basis points, and diluted earnings per share ended at $2.37, a 35% increase over 2010. Focusing on the fourth quarter, sales were up 13% to $762.8 million; internal growth was strong at 6%, while acquisitions added 7%.  Operating income for the fourth quarter increased 24% to $167.4 million, from $135.5 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our operational excellence activities. Operating income margin in the quarter was a record at 21.9%, a 190 basis points improvement over the fourth quarter of 2010.  Net income was up 25% to $101.9 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.63 were up 26% over last year’s fourth quarter. Orders in the fourth quarter were $748 million, up 4% over a difficult comparison from the prior year.  Operating cash flow was suburb with both the fourth quarter and full-year results representing records. Operating cash flow was $153 million for the quarter and $509 million for the year, up 19% and 20% respectively. Free cash flow was 132% of net income in the fourth quarter and 119% of net income for the full year.  Turning our attention to the individual operating groups; the Electronics Instrument group had a tremendous fourth quarter with strength across each of our major businesses. For the quarter, sales were up 17% to a record $441.5 million, on accelerating growth in our Aerospace business, and continuing strength in our process, tower, and industrial businesses. The Reichert technologies and EM Test acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter, also contributed to the growth.  Internal growth was 9%, acquisitions added 8%, and foreign currency translation had no impact on EIG. EIG’s operating income increased 29% to $116.3 million, and operating margins were very strong at 26.3%, up 240 basis points over last year’s fourth quarter. Both operating income and operating margins in the quarter were records.  The Electromechanical group also performed well in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Sales were up 7% to $321.3 million in the fourth quarter on strength in our differentiated businesses. In particular, our aerospace third-party MRO business was very strong. The acquisitions of Avicenna Technology and Coining, also contributed to the growth.  Internal growth was 1%, acquisitions added 6%, and foreign currency had no impact. EMG’s operating income increased 6% to $62.3 million, and operating margins were 19.4%.  Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company and our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success.  Operational excellence has many facets within AMETEK, including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma in our factories and back office operations, designed for Six Sigma in our new product development efforts, and the movement of production to low cost locales.  We are especially pleased with our working capital results, which reached an all-time record level in the fourth quarter. Working capital as a percentage of sales was 17% in the quarter. We also continue to drive lower cost through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. From these sourcing activities, we recognized $8 million in savings of the fourth quarter, and $30 million in savings for all of 2011.  For 2012, we expect approximately $40 million in incremental savings through our material cost reduction initiatives. All of these operational excellent efforts were key drivers in achieving record operating margin of 21.9% in the quarter, full-year margins were 21.3%, an all-time record for AMETEK and up 180 basis points from 2010. Moving on to our second strategy, global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK’s growth.  In the fourth quarter of 2011, international sales represented 50% of our total sales. Due to the investments we’ve made over the last several years, order growth in the BRIC locations was very strong, at 18% in the quarter and 35% for the full year. We have also seen continued growth in our global, oil, and gas business, as many new supply sources are being explored and developed. In particular, the growth of the Canadian Oil Sands, as an attractive source for proven oil reserves, has led to a number of opportunities for our solid-state controls business unit. The latest order awarded was the UPS system contract for the Kearl Oil Sands in Alberta, Canada. The initial order was valued at $2.3 million with additional orders expected to follow. AMETEK’s solid-state controls was previously awarded orders for the supply of industrial UPS equipment, totally over $6 million related to other Oil Sands projects in Canada. AMETEK has devoted considerable resources to this growing market, including establishing a local service center, to further enhance our position and serve customers. We are well positioned to capture additional business and support of the development of the Oil Sands as the leading supplier of industrial UPS equipment in Canada. In the fourth quarter, AMETEK’s EM Test business booked their first order to supply compliance testing solutions into the hybrid and electric car market. This order is for the supply of a compliance test system, to test surge, harmonics and flicker for E-car charging stations. EM Test is in discussions with many of the leading automobile manufacturers, and expects similar orders to follow.  As the hybrid and electric vehicle market develops, a set of compliance standards is emerging, which will require electric automobile manufacturers and charging stations to comply with electronic discharge and compatibility standards.  REM Test business, which we acquired in October of 2011, is well positioned to capitalize on this niche market opportunity. EM Test is currently the clear leader in providing conductive immunity solutions to the automotive test industry, enabling car manufacturers and their supply chain, to ensure compliance to ISO standards. This opportunity is a great example of AMETEK’s strategy to expand our existing capabilities into new market areas. Moving on to our third strategy, new product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We’ve consistently invested in RD&E. In 2011, we spent $137 million, which was up 22% from 2010, and in 2012 we expect to spend $155 million, a 13% increase over 2011.  And we’re excited about some recent new product introductions. Our Vision Research business introduced a third generation of their Phantom Miro high-speed imaging camera line, the Miro M-Series. The Phantom Miro line is targeted at scientist and engineers for use in applied research applications, product development, and quality monitoring of high-speed processes. The new Miro M-Series delivers a price-to-performance ratio, which sets a new benchmark in the industry, in addition, it provides for a new level of performance and ease of use, which will open new segments of the market to high-speed imaging. Our Medical Interconnects business recently received their first order for the supply of highly-engineered cables and cable harnesses, for use in portable medical imaging products. This order was received from Varian Medical Systems, an existing customer of our medical interconnect business.  Demand for portable products, such as portable ultrasound and X-ray equipment, has increased through the improvements in imaging quality, along with the continued focus on reducing medical cost and improving access. Our Medical Interconnects business is well positioned to capitalize on further opportunities in this developing niche market, given our strong technical and engineering capabilities, along with our excellent relationships with many of the key medical OEMs. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 21% of sales in the fourth quarter, up from 19% last year, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers.  Turning our attention to acquisitions, which is our core strategy, we had another tremendous year for acquisitions in 2011, and with the announcement this morning of the acquisition of O'Brien Corporation, we started 2012 strong. I will discuss O'Brien in a moment, but first wanted to address our 2011 acquisitions.  We deployed nearly $475 million in capital on five acquisitions in 2011, and acquired approximately $215 million in annual revenue. We acquired an excellent set of highly-differentiated businesses that expanded our market opportunities and technology base, in the areas of electrical interconnects, [inaudible], diagnostics, programmable power, and high-end and analytical instrumentation. In the fourth quarter alone, we closed three acquisitions, Reichert Technologies, EM Test, and Technical Manufacturing Corporation.  Over the last two years, we have deployed over $1 billion in capital on acquisitions, and acquired approximately $430 million in annual revenue.  The last acquisition completed in 2011 was Technical Manufacturing Corporation, which we closed in December. TMC is a global leader in high-performance precision vibration isolation systems, for use in ultra-precision measurement applications, where vibration isolation is critical to accuracy. AMETEK has and will use these products in conjunction with our high-end metrology instrumentation.  TMC was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $30 million. TMC’s products include Piezoelectric vibration cancellation systems, which are based on TMC’s patented active Piezo technology. They also provide passive vibration cancellation systems, optical test benches, and acoustic and magnetic isolation hoods. It’s customers include the leading manufacturers of life sciences, botanics, and semiconductor equipment, along with testing laboratories and universities, where vibration isolation is critical to the quality of their testing work. TMC is an excellent acquisition for AMETEK and fits well with our ultra-precision technology business, it’s the leader in its market niche, and has unique differentiated technology. It also provides compelling market synergy opportunities across many of our high-end analytical instruments businesses, given the complementary nature of its product offering, and the common customer base. Now, turning to the acquisition of O'Brien Corporation, which we announced this morning.  O'Brien is a leading manufacturer of fluid and gas handling solutions, sample conditioning equipment, and process analyzers used in critical applications in the process industries worldwide.  O'Brien was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $80 million. The price paid was approximately $175 million. O'Brien’s product offering includes pre insulation tubing bundles, sample conditioning equipment, specialty electro polished tubing for use in high purity applications, instrument enclosures, and process analyzers. Its products are used to enable the capture, transport, and analyses of liquids, gases, vapors and emissions, in challenging process environments, such as oil and gas production, refining, petrochemical processing, power generation, pharmaceutical manufacturer, and semiconduction fabrication. O'Brien’s product lines are both highly differentiated and highly complementary to AMETEK’s process instrument businesses, combined with our analytic instrument solutions, AMETEK can now offer its customers a complete solution for most of their process analysis needs. In addition, we expect to lever the strong customer relationships of the combined businesses and AMETEK’s global capability, to further extend O'Brien’s market reach. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2012 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial and managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition focus. Our backlog of deals is excellent, our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy.  Turning now to the outlook for 2012. We expect our businesses to continue to show solid growth in 2012, with our longer-cycle, oil and gas, power and aerospace businesses showing particular strength. Our solid backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence, capabilities, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to perform well in 2012. We anticipate 2012 revenue to be up low double-digits on a percentage basis from 2011, organic growth is expected to be up mid-single digits for all of AMETEK and for both operating groups. Earnings for 2012 are expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.70 per diluted share, up 12% to 14% over 2011, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth and our operational excellence initiatives. First quarter of 2012 sales, are expected to be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from last year’s first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.63 to $0.65 per diluted share, up 13% to 16% over last year’s first quarter. In summary, our overall businesses performed extremely well in the fourth quarter and in 2011, producing record results for essentially all key financial metric. We expect top and bottom-line growth to continue in 2012, as our longer cycle, higher profit businesses show particular strength, and the benefits of our 2011 acquisitions are fully realized. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy.  In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. John, will now cover some of the financial details, and then we’ll be glad to take your questions.
John Molinelli : Thank you Frank. As Frank noted, we had a strong fourth quarter with excellent financial performance and a high quality of earnings. I will provide some further details.  Core growth in selling expenses in the quarter was in line with growth in core sales. General and Administrative expenses were 1.5% of sales below last year’s fourth quarter level of 1.9% of sales, driven primarily by lower consulting spend in this year’s fourth quarter.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.7%, up from last year’s fourth quarter rate of 29.4%. The full-year tax rate was 30.9% versus last year’s rate of 30.1%, and in line with our expectations.  For 2012, we would expect our tax rate to be between 30 and 31%. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables was 17% of sales in the fourth quarter, down from 18% in last year’s fourth quarter. This record low level of working capital positions AMETEK as one of the top performers in our peer group, and is a direct reflection of the tremendous drives our business units have taken, in driving towards operational excellence. Strong working capital management will remain a key priority. Capital spending was $18 million for the quarter, and $51 million for the full-year. Full-year 2011 capital expenditures were 1.7% of sales. 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be about $60 million.  Depreciation and amortization was $24 million for the quarter and $87 million for the full-year. 2012 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $100 million. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter and full-year were records. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $153 million, up 19% over last year’s fourth quarter, and full-year operating cash flow of $509 million was up 20% over 2010. Free cash flow was $134 million for the fourth quarter, representing 132% of net income. For the full-year, free cash flow was $458 million approximately 119% of net income, continuing our strong free cash flow generation. Our strong cash flow was deployed to support our acquisition strategy where we expended nearly $475 million on transactions in 2011. In addition, we repurchased $59 million in stock in 2011.  Total debt was $1.26 billion at December 31, up $95 million from 2010 year-end. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalence of $170 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at December 31, of 34.8%, down from 36.2% at the end of 2010. At December 31, we had approximately $915 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Subsequent to the end of 2011 we acquired O'Brien Corporation for approximately $175 million. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains to acquisitions.  And in summary, we had an outstanding 2011 establishing records for essentially all the key financial metrics. We’re well positioned for further growth, organically and through acquisitions with a strong balance sheet and cash flow. That concludes our prepared remarks, we are now happy to take questions.
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. 
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo:  Hi. Good morning, guys. 
Frank Hermance:  Hi, Allison. 
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo: So, obviously, concerns about Europe and emerging market growth is certainly on the forefront of investor’s minds. Could you just give us a little color on what you’re seeing geographically as well as how you’re thinking about it going into 2012? 
Frank Hermance:  Sure, Allison. We saw a little impact of Europe in the fourth quarter. It was predominately in our floor care motor business. If you look at the organic growth numbers for the company at 6% overall, the organic growth in Europe was about 3% and the organic growth in Asia was about 9%. And in the U.S., it was around 6%. So Europe was a little weaker but you know, not significantly. And probably, very importantly, our order intake so far in January has been nothing short of superb. And Europe looks fairly good so I’m not overly concerned at this point, but obviously, we are going to watch it very, very closely. And as you know, they’re very aggressive if revenue starts to show weakness in terms of removing costs and keeping our profitability up. So, so far, so good, but I would say some slight weakness in Europe. 
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo: Great. And also, obviously you guys have done a great job on margins in 2011 and historically. How should we think about the margin profile going forward? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, we believe that even though we’ve hit record levels on margins, that there’s definitely more runway. I have consistently said through the course of 2011 to model about 30 basis points as we go forward and as we’ve rolled up the budgets, we feel confident in another 30 basis points of improvement in 2012. And it really comes from two places; first, with the organic growth that we’ve talked about in 2012 of mid-single digits and with the contribution margins that we have, which are superb. In the fourth quarter, our contribution margin was greater than the 40% so you take that organic growth with that kind of contribution margin and obviously that’s going to be a positive impact on the overall margins in the company.  And secondly, as always, we will be aggressive on the cost reduction side. In 2012, we’re going to put approximately $60 million of cost improvements through the P&L. So you take those two dynamics and it does lead to improving margins.  Normally, what we do is give you some estimates at the beginning of the year and then the margins get better as we go through the year and I hope that will be the case this year. So the 30 basis points is probably a conservative amount. 
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo: Great. Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Robert Berry with UBS. Please proceed with your question.  
Robert Berry – UBS: Hi, guys. Good morning. 
Frank Hermance:  Hi, Robert. 
Robert Berry – UBS: First on O'Brien, is there any assumed accretion this year from it? 
Frank Hermance:  There’s a cents of accretion that’s in our estimates, but nothing substantial. There will be costs that will run through the P&L as we integrate that business. So the real effect on the bottom line will come more in 2013 than 2012. 
Robert Berry – UBS: Got you. And then you called out areas of strength; Aerospace and also Oil and Gas. I was wondering if you could just unpack each of those a little bit for us in terms of what your outlook is in the various areas within Aero and also within Oil and Gas, particularly up versus downstream. Thanks. 
Frank Hermance:  Sure, Robert. I would be glad to do that. Why don’t I start with our overall Aerospace business. That business completed a solid year with high single digit organic growth in the fourth quarter and it was on strengths in the third-party MRO business, the commercial businesses. We expect to really see strong growth for all of Aerospace in 2012 and that’s going to be based on the OEM build rates.  If you look at Boeing, they’re projecting to be up about 18% on build rates. Airbus is expected to be up about 9%. So overall, we’re looking at 13% build rate in the 2012 timeframe. And also, revenue passenger miles support strong growth.  And our business and regional jet business as well, is expected to do very well. But that’s mainly due to program wins on new aircraft, not as much by market as it is by the engineering efforts we’ve put in place.  So to give you some specifics on the various segments, in 2012 we expect our commercial and third-party MRO businesses will be high-single digits. Our business and regional jet business, we actually expect to be up low-double digits, so it’s going to be actually our strongest growth area. And our military business is expected to be up low-single digits.  So when you sum all of that up, we expect our overall Aerospace business should be up in that mid-to-high single digits region in 2012. And as I mentioned, our orders look really good in January and Aerospace is one of the drivers for that.  Talking about the process businesses and oil and gas, I’ll talk first about the process businesses overall and then I’ll come back to address your upstream, midstream, downstream question.  The process markets performed extremely well in Q4, both in the quarter and the full year, with strong growth across most of the business in process. In the quarter, our growth was driven by oil and gas, ultra-precision technology and our advanced measurement technology businesses. So it’s broader than oil and gas, although oil and gas was a key driver.  Sales were up high-single digits organically in the quarter and high-teens overall. And if you look to 2012, we expect this business to grow high teens overall with organic growth of mid-single digits.  And if you look at the later cycle oil and gas businesses, that is going to be a driver for this.  So if you look at the various segments of upstream versus midstream versus downstream. The growth is clearly being driven more by upstream than it is by midstream or downstream. However, the midstream business is still reasonably good and if you look at the downstream business, outside of the U.S. and about 70% of our process businesses are outside the U.S. it’s pretty good. This has been a driver to the company in 2011 and we expect it to do extremely well in 2012. 
Robert Berry – UBS: Great. Thank you very much. 
Frank Hermance:  Sure. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets: Thanks, good morning, guys. 
Frank Hermance:  Hello, Jim. 
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets: Frist a housekeeping question. John, the payables number? 
John Molinelli:  Sure, Jim; $283 million. 
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets: Great, thanks a lot. And Frank, first question. With regards to the EMG core of 1% in the fourth quarter, could you walk us through the dynamic there given the commentary about the Aerospace and differentiated businesses? Just what was the dynamic behind the slower core in the fourth quarter in EMG? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, sure, Jim. Basically, the driver there was Europe, as I mentioned and it was predominately in the floor care and motor business. That particular business was weaker than we had anticipated. It was down about mid-single digits and we were forecasting more flattish for that particular business. So that had an impact on the organic growth in that portion of our business.  But the good news is that January is starting off quite strong. So it’s actually a bit hard for us to understand exactly what happened. It was really at the end of the fourth quarter, it just looked like things slowed, but then it popped back. So we’re going to watch that closely, but that was the key driver and the answer to your question. 
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets: Okay, so the other components of EMG were in line or better than your forecast? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, they were fine. The other components were fine. 
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets: Okay. And you know, just a follow up on the emerging market question; you’ve, you know, made a lot of investments there through the years. Could you just give us an update of what you’re seeing in the three key emerging markets of China, India and Brazil going into 2012? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, I mean, the BRIC countries in general look very exciting to us. I know there’s been a lot of talk in the press about slowing growth rates in those countries. But our market shares are low and all those countries are doing well for us. Overall, for the BRIC countries in 2012, we’re looking at approximately 20% growth for the company. So they will be a key driver. Actually, it’s 22% is the actual way that our budget is rolled up. So they’re going to be a driver to our growth.  If you’ll look at our concentration, it’s heavily China. That market continues to do well for us. India, we’ve made some major investments over the course of the last three or four years. We saw excellent growth in 2011 and we expect that to continue in 2012. If you look at Brazil, we don’t have as much volume in Brazil, but we have decided to put significant investments in Brazil. We feel that, you know, we’ve been working in China for many, many years. We’ve done a lot in India, so our intention now is focused more in Brazil.  I may have mentioned in our last conference call, Jim, that we know have a 140,000 square foot facility in Brazil. We’ve won some major business with PetroBrass, which we’re going to produce in that facility. We’ve opened it up now to the other AMETEK divisions, that they can put production down there. We’ve got the infrastructure to support that and our businesses are looking at it as aggressively as they have in China, for instance. It’s very unfortunate to be able to manufacturer in Brazil because of the terror situations that are a factor in that business.  And in that plant, we’re also going to beef up our distribution capabilities. We’re going to have our divisions as we have in China and in India, put people down there in all of these BRIC countries. If my recollection is correct, we’re going to add just under 60 people that are predominately in the distribution network, a few in engineering in India just to continue that growth profile.  So we’re pretty encouraged with all of the BRIC countries and we think it’s going to be a key driver to our gross, so we’re going to continue those investments. 
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Frank Hermance. :  You bet. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. 
Frank Hermance:  Scott, are you there? 
Operator:  Mr. Graham, go ahead, your line is open. 
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: Can you hear me? 
Frank Hermance:  Now we can, Scott. 
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: Fine, I’m sorry, I had my mute on. Good morning, all three of you. 
John Molinelli:  Hi, Scott. 
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: So from what I heard you say, Frank, and correct me if I’m wrong, I think you said fourth quarter organic orders were up 4, is that right? 
Frank Hermance:  That’s correct. ’12 overall orders are up four. And organic…
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: Would you be able to split that between the two segments? 
Frank Hermance:  Actually, I don’t have that information here, so I can’t split it. We don’t look at orders as fundamentally the key drivers, Scott, because Aerospace orders just come in in lumps and actually, I don’t have that data here. So we can get it for you. 
John Molinelli:  We’ll get it for you. 
Frank Hermance:  We’ll get it for you, Scott. 
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: Yeah, no, but [inaudible] cycle is always lumpy, I get that. But was there anything, you mentioned that there were tough comps and you’re kind of talking about the floor care. Was there any other businesses that maybe contributed to that number maybe being a little bit below what we have seen? 
Frank Hermance:  Not really. There was maybe a little weakness in our TMC business, which is the higher technology and motors that are more in the differentiated segment. But again, those orders came back very good in January. So I would just say it was sort of the even flow, not anything that would be any different than sort of a normal recovery because we’re coming back from sort of a recession. We’ve had huge organic growth over the course of the last year and now we’re coming back to what I would call more normality. So there is some movement up and down. But we’re fairly encouraged right now. We think 2012 is going to be a fine year. 
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: Yes. I definitely sense that you know, my sense is that you’re sensing that the fourth quarter 4% was just something more of lumpiness more than anything else. I don’t want to paraphrase here, but that’s… 
Frank Hermance:  That’s true. 
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: And then if you wouldn’t mind, maybe going through some of the other businesses, you know, power, industrial and is there anyway, would you mind, if you could do this, great, to split kind of floor care versus technical versus EIG on the fourth quarter organic? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, let me talk to your question in a way that I typically talk about the various subsegments in the business. Looking at EIG, I think we’ve handled Aerospace and we’ve handled the process businesses. So the one remaining part of EIG is the power and industrial and that business was very strong in Q4, sales were up low-teens organically and more than 20% overall, with excellent growth across both the power and the industrial parts of the business. So strength really across that whole subsegment.  Looking forward in 2012, we expect sales for power and industrial to be up low-teens overall and mid-single digits organically. So if you sum what we talked about for Aerospace, for process and for power and industrial, for all of EIG, we’re expecting sales to be up about mid-teens overall and organically to be up mid-single digits. And hopefully, that mid-single digit organic is a conservative number. We’ll see how that goes as the year unfolds.  Moving to the other half of the company where we really talk about this in two subsegments, the differentiated EMG businesses and our cost-driven motor business, for the differentiated EMG businesses, overall sales were up about 10% in Q4, a solid growth in the third party MRO business and obviously, we had contributions from acquisitions, which were out of [inaudible] Technology and coining, which helped to drive that business.  And looking into 2012, we’d expect this business to be up again about 10% and organic growth in the mid-single digit arena. So you know the business is doing very good and we expect it’s going to continue.  The cost-driven motor business, which is the other piece of EMG, was weak in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned. Q4 sales were down mid-single digits, which was weaker than we had anticipated, primarily due to Europe. And for 2012, we expect this business to be up low-to-mid-single digits and you know, the January orders support that growth.  So if you sum those parts of EMG, for all of EMG we’re expecting a high-single digit growth in 2012 and organic growth of mid-single digits. And the last thing I commented is, if you then look at both halves of the business and sum them up, as I'm mentioned in my overall talk , we’re expecting low-double digits sales growth. We’re expecting another just fine year from a sales growth picture with organic growth in that mid-single digit arena.  So that gives you some color. 
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: That gives a lot of color, Frank. Thank you. My last question is this. Do you have a specific FX impact within your budget, you know, is it, are you expecting minus 1, 2, 3? Is there, you know something that you can offer on that? 
Frank Hermance:  On what, on pricing? 
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: On FX. 
Frank Hermance: On FX. Probably as we go into 2012, about a point of negative headwind. 
Scott Graham – Jefferies & Company: Thanks very much. 
Frank Hermance:  Okay. 
Operator:  Our next questions come from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer :  Thank you, good morning. 
Frank Hermance:  Morning, Chris. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer :  I have a question on what the price was in the quarter and your 2012 outlook, and just overall update and complexion on how you view your pricing power in the portfolio. 
Frank Hermance:  Yes, basically in the 4th quarter our price end was up about 2 points and we have rolling in our - word it this way, we asked our divisions to get 2% in terms of pricing. While we rolled through our budgets and what's in the forecast we gave you is 1 point. And obviously, we're hoping that will be conservative, but that's the way we gave the estimates. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer :  Okay, and then just interested in a little more detail on the globalizing opportunity for the two recent deals of O'Brien and TMC as now part of AMETEK. And more broadly, how much of a role did those strategies play in 2011? Do you think with realizing synergies with your global channels and recent acquisitions? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, it's a huge factor Chris, and an excellent question. If you look at the two acquisitions that I talked about this morning in detail, TMC and O'Brien, both of those businesses have about 70% of their volume in the US. And that's an advantage of buying companies of the relative size that we buy in that they don't have as a significant amount of international exposure because it's expensive, and for a small company to put the infrastructure in is typical. So we put infrastructure in place for our acquisitions so that in essence that can come right out on day 1 and simply put people in our infrastructure, those people report back to the acquired business. But we have the - we know how to pay those people, we've got the legal structures set up, we got the facilities, etcetera. So it's very, very easy for those acquired companies to immediately gain access to distribution in China, distribution in India, shortly we'll have that capability in Brazil, as I talked about. And we have that capability in Europe as well. So it's definitely a sizable factor when we think about deals, and especially businesses like O'Brien for instance, where the market opportunity outside the US is huge for that business. As I mentioned for our profit businesses, about 70% of our volume is outside the US and that where a sizable amount of growth comes. So we're going to capitalize on that. We've set that company up in a way to capitalize on it, and we're pretty excited about it. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer :  Okay, thanks. And then last one, just some clarification. You noted the 60 million cost savings in the plan, is that sort of a gross number that that's against natural inflation and it all kind of rolls up into the leverage targets?
Frank Hermance:  That's exactly right Chris. Basically that 60 million is just the cost that we're taking out of the business and pricing is going to be a positive, and then on the other side of the, sort of, the balance sheet there's going to be inflation, and there's going to be investments. And I can give you a rough flavor that on the investment side we plan to put in about $37 million in 2012. And so we sum all of that up with the contribution margins of the company and that's in essence how we get to the bottom line in the estimates that you're talking about. So it is a gross cost number when we speak to it. Another measure, just to go a bit further on your question is we do look internally at just cost minus - excuse me, price minus inflation. Just that's another measure and I have some numbers in the 4th quarter. Price minus inflation was 0.8% of sales. And the budgets are rolling up in that same region - in that same kind of region. So…
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer :  Great, thanks Frank. 
Frank Hermance :  Hey, you bet.
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research:  Good morning gentlemen. 
Male:  Morning Mark.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research :  So Frank, that 60 million in gross savings, that's including the 40 million of your global sourcing initiatives?
Frank Hermance :  That's correct.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research :  Okay, and the additional 20 is just kind of operational improvements?
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, it's operational improvements. It would include a few plant consolidations that we're going to do. And, you know, netted in that number is any cost associated with any restructuring that is going on. So that's sort of a net number on the cost improvements going through the P&L, but it doesn't include inflation. And it doesn't include other investments that we're making. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research :  Okay, great. And then can you bridge the EPS in 2012 for us? How much volumes, acquisitions, and then I guess you talked about operational improvements. Is there a way to break it out that way?
Male:  Boy, that's a very tough question, John do you have any thoughts on that?
John Molinelli: No, I don't. I think - I think when you get the EPS you're getting into tax effect, some of these things. That's really not how we break down the - how we look at the businesses Mark.
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research:  Okay. In talking about BRIC countries, what were their percentage of sales in 2011?
Frank Hermance:  About 11% of our total sales are in the BRIC countries. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research:  11%, okay. And then, I guess, finally when you talk about process, how big was that in '11? And then, on the oil and gas side, how much are you tied to the fracking, natural gas phenomenon going on, particularly in the US? And then, are you seeing potential pullbacks in investments with the slide in the natural gas prices? Is that some chatter going on? Assuming you're tied to that market. 
Male:  This segment was on the order of $1 billion. That whole process business, and if you break it down, about 1/3 of that is in oil and gas. About 25% is related to the metals industry, where we do analytic instrumentation in metals. About 20% is in what we would call research and development. And the remaining, whatever it is, 22% I think, is basically in varied industries. So within that 1/3 that is oil and gas, there's roughly an equal component of oil and gas in that 1/3 of the business. And though, to date although that's being under $3, which is incredibly low, and there's a lot of talk about some reductions in drilling, if you actually look at the data the recount in Q4 actually reached a higher level than it was back in 2008. There's about, I think it's 3700 active rigs that are working at the present time. So there could be some impact in the fracking area. I did see an article where Chesapeake is discussing, or has actually decided that they're going to cut back some drilling. But oil is doing just fine. So it's pretty strong. I mean, it's pretty good. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research:  Okay, thank you. 
Male:  Yeah, just another point. Bill dropped me a note, that is correct, that I should have mentioned. Remember 70% of our business is outside the US as well. So again, you're not going to have that major an impact even if the fracking goes down a bit in the US. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research:  Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets:  Hi, good morning.
Male:  Good morning. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets:  I think you touched both the BRICs and the growth you're expecting out of those regions in '12. You know, 20% plus and I think you said it was in the high teens in the 4th quarter. Just wondering, you do have some difficult comps coming up in the 1st through the 3rd quarter, just wondering how to think about where you see that growth coming from and your confidence level there. 
Frank Hermance :  Got pretty high confidence in the 1st two quarters of the year. You know, it's not as clear in the 2nd half of the year, but we've got excellent backlog, it's over $900 million. Aerospace is just accelerating, so we're very excited about it. And if you look at the profit margins in aerospace and process and in the power industry of businesses, they have very high contribution margins. So we've got, I would say significant confidence in the 1st half of the year. And we've been a bit conservative on our estimates for the full year, and it's really based on it's not as clear in the 2nd half. And so we want to watch that and although I don't think Europe is going to crash, if it did obviously that's going to have an impact on us in the 2nd half. So we don't want to be too aggressive at this point. But I think the fundamental answer to your question is we've got a high confidence in the 1st half of the year. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets:  Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And on the EMG side, the margin's down a touch from last year, is that really just the drag from the cost driven motor [Inaudible]?
Frank Hermance :  Yeah, there's a drag there. I mean, we were, I think, 20 basis points, but still the margins are darn good at just under 20% - 19.4% in a quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets:  Right, thanks. And then, just lastly, on the M&A side what areas is the deal pipeline weighted today?
Frank Hermance:  Well first of all, the deal pipeline is just great. We've obviously been very successful over the course of the last 15 months. And not only buying companies, but in buying good companies that are really close adjacencies to what we do. And we can leverage those companies in terms of increasing their reach, etcetera. And the backlog really has deals in all of the major areas. We'll acquire in aerospace, we'll acquire in the process businesses, we'll acquire in the power part of our business, and also in the differentiated part of the EMG. The only part of the company that we don't intend to do any acquisitions is in the floor care and sort of cost driven part of EMGs. So it's hard to predict where the deals are actually going to come from as we take each deal and sort of wrestle it to the ground, but I think you could assume we're going to do the kind of deals we've done over the last 15 months. And we did for instance, Avicenna and Coining rolled up in EMG. Reichert, TMC, and EM Test rolled up in EIG, so you had three in one part of the company and two in the other. And O'Brien this morning, the first one out of the box is going to be in EIG. And I can also tell you that we're working on another good sized deal in the EMG side of the business. So I'm not specifically answering your question because it's varied, but there's lots of opportunity. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets:  Great. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it, thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Keybanc. Please proceed with your question.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Morning. Just a couple questions. Frank, you had indicated I think, I your remarks that you expected the military side of aerospace to still be up in the low single digits in '12. What was it in '11? And I guess, what sort of gives you the confidence in that viewpoint just given everything that's going on with that?
Frank Hermance:  Right, well it's about the same. It was in that low single digit kind of arena in 2011. And we feel that even with some of the reductions - I know there's going to be some more color on that today. There was a little bit in the Wall Street Journal. But if you look at what they're doing, and like this morning they were talking about increasing the number of drones by about 30% due to the success we've had, and obviously we've got content on drones. So I think the two drivers for us are that the electronic content in military either ground based vehicles or aerocraft is going up and we are the prime provider to the military of cooling solutions for those electronics. So even if the overall military budget is going to wane some we believe we can and we’ve shown that we can outgrow that. So we think positively about that. The other side is an EIG more is that we've invested very heavily in helicopters and they have to change this fleet to a more helicopter base fleet. Just this recent situation in Somalia, they - using aircraft to parachute the SEALs in and then using helicopters to get them back out. And so those investments also are going to sort of outgrow the military budget. So, you know, and we've got pretty good visibility is this business so we think that low single digit rate is reasonable. I guess, if we wanted to look at it negatively, I'm saying the overall aerospace is going to grow in that mid to high single digits. If we didn't have the drag of military at low single digits we'd be probably up in double digits. So it's not all good, but we also don't feel that there's a major problem there. So I hope that helps Matt.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets:  Yeah, that does. And then just another question on the aerospace side of business. Could you maybe differentiate a little bit between what your expectations are for 3rd party MRO growth versus sort of the traditional civilian aftermarket related piece? And I guess, how much is share gain playing a role in your outlook there?
Frank Hermance:  Actually if we look at the 3rd party MRO business, we're saying that's going to be up, high single digits. And we're also saying that commercial aviation is going to be up high single digits. Now, for that 3rd part MRO piece, the market is estimated to be up about 4%. Just to put a flavor on it, and therefore, a good part of the remainder is share gain. There is some price in there, but a good part of it is in essence share gain. If you look at the commercial side, that is more driven by the OEM production and just taking advantage of the market conditions. As I mentioned Boeing and Airbus combined are going to be up 13% in build rates. And obviously, we have to lead them because they need our parts to build their airplanes. And that's why as we went into the 2nd half of last year we saw this accelerating growth. So that's less share gain than it is market. Does that help?
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets :  Thank you, Frank. Yes, absolutely. Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Elana Wood of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. 
Elana Wood - Bank of America:  Good morning everybody. 
Frank Hermance:  Hello, Elana. 
Elana Wood - Bank of America:  Wondering if you've calculated incremental margins as acquisitions for the 4th quarter? 
Frank Hermance:  We did. They were superb. They were in excess of 40%. 
Elana Wood - Bank of America:  Okay, and I was just wondering, what is your kind of baseline assumption for the total company this year in terms of organic growth in Europe?
Frank Hermance:  It's about the same number we talked about in the 3rd quarter. It's like a 3% kind of number, a little bit less than the US, for instance. And it's significantly less than Asia. 
Elana Wood - Bank of America:  Okay, do you see it dipping into negative territory in the 1st quarter or do you expect it to stay positive?
Frank Hermance:  Oh no, we expect it to remain positive. I think the growth there, where we're very strong is in the process businesses. And I think we're going to be just fine. 
Elana Wood - Bank of America:  Okay, and then just circling back on the acquisition - the O'Brien acquisition, what was the purchase price multiple on EBITDA, in terms of EBITDA?
Frank Hermance:  The multiple on that deal was about 9 times trailing. On the TMC deal it was about 6 ½ times trailing. So actually that was good news to me that we're starting to see some better deals out there - a little bit more reasonable multiples. 
Elana Wood - Bank of America:  Okay, and then just lastly, I was just wondering if there was any unusual items in your 2012 guidance? How much tension is embedded in the guidance? I know…
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, we’re in good shape. I'll let John answer that question. 
John Molinelli:  Yeah Elana, we are - well first of all we're overfunded on our prominent part of our pension numbers. We're looking at probably about a $0.03 headwind going into 2012 if you just look at the pension. But we’ve got a couple other accounts, the restricted stock invested in 2011, obviously that expense won't - is not part of our 2012 outlook. That's a couple cent to the good, so if you put a couple of those types of things together it's sort of a push, maybe a little bit, slight headwind, but it's just not significant at all. So we really don't see that as an overall distraction from running the business. 
Elana Wood - Bank of America:  Okay, terrific. Thank you so much. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird and Company. Please proceed with your question. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  Thanks. Just two questions. Frank, I was doing the math here on the backlog and I think you eluded to this, is the back log up around 912? Something like that?
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, you got it. It's 911 million. It's up about $83 million since the beginning of last year. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  So about 10% year over year. And then is that - would you think of aerospace and maybe process those, you know, maybe a little longer cycle businesses, would their backlog be up greater than that? Is that where there's some confidence coming from?
Frank Hermance : Yeah, yeah. No, I think if you look at the breakdown of that backlog it does have a higher component of the longer cycle businesses and therefore, you couple that with the fact that the orders have been - you know, even the first part of this year, have started very strong, we just feel pretty confident in the short-term outlook, the six month outlook. So even if we have some weakness in other parts of the business we feel our estimates will more than cover that.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  Yes, okay. And then just - I wanted to just double back for a second on the geographic thoughts for '12. We're expecting some modest Europe growth and then I presume for '12 if we think US and Asia, or rest of the world, we're probably in these same general growth rates that we saw on the 4th quarter?
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean, we're saying mid-single digits for the company a little bit weaker in Europe, stronger, much stronger in other parts of the world, but they are a smaller part of the business. So that's where you sum up to this sort of mid 6% kind of number. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  And is the BRIC waiting - the sales waiting that goes into the BRIC countries, is that toward - it sounds like it's towards the process, maybe aerospace, but is - which businesses do you BRIC exposure weight towards?
Frank Hermance:  They weight towards the process businesses and there's definitely an aerospace component, but process is a key driver. And it's because of the international markets that we've talked about, with oil and gas, and those kinds of businesses being largely outside the US. Our metrology businesses are very strong in China. So those businesses - and Russia as well, our process businesses are the strongest in Russia. So those are the drivers for the growth and we feel pretty good about that. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  And there's no general degradation in incremental margins on process instrument sales into those emerging markets?
Frank Hermance:  No, absolutely not. Matter of fact, we've looked at this very, very, closely during our strategic planning activities. And if you roll up and look at the bottom line profits in the BRIC countries, as a percentage of sales, versus the rest of AMETEK they're almost identical, less than a point difference. And in the BRIC countries they're actually higher. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  Okay, very good, great. Thank you, very nice quarter. 
Frank Hermance:  Thank you Richard. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Scott Graham with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Go ahead, your line is open. 
Scott Graham - Jefferies:  Yeah, I'm having trouble with my mute button here, and I'm sorry for that.
Frank Hermance:  We'll get you a new mute button Scott.
Scott Graham - Jefferies:  You know, budgets are tight on the self-side so - you know, the 4% - I'm sorry to ask you about this question again, but the 4% orders number for the 4th quarter, Frank was that a total number or was it an organic?
Frank Hermance:  That was a total number and our organic was slightly less than that. 
Scott Graham - Jefferies:  So the organic was slightly less than that. If I factor in that BRICs was a real good number, you know, it would be fair to say then that sort of US/Europe was flat to only slightly up, fair?
Frank Hermance:  You're talking about orders now or are you talking about sales?
Scott Graham - Jefferies:  Orders, organic orders.
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, that's right. I think that's right Scott.
Scott Graham - Jefferies:  Okay, then on that, let me just - the next question that stems is, you've got an outlook of let's say plus 3% in organic Europe, I was just wondering kind of what businesses would you expect to contribute to that 3?
Frank Hermance:  Oh, it's really a similar answer to Richard's question in that's it's predominantly going to be the process businesses. And, you know, they are, one thing you also have to realize is that we roll up the Middle East and we roll up Russia in that part of the world And the process businesses are doing very, very well. So they will be a key driver. And also, we have sizeable aerospace content. We have a major company, actually several companies in Europe that service that part of the world and aerospace is doing fine in Europe. So you take those two factors and you say okay, maybe floor care is not going to be as good and we feel, we're pretty comfortable with these numbers. Matter of fact, it would not surprise me if we even exceeded this guidance that I'm giving you. 
Scott Graham - Jefferies:  That's very helpful, thanks a lot. 
Frank Hermance:  Okay, Scott.

Frank Hermance – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Bill. AMETEK had a strong third quarter. We established quarterly records for operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted EPS, and operating cash flow. Sales in the third quarter were up 16% to $750.5 million. Internal growth was strong at 8% while acquisitions added 7% and currency added 1% to sales. Operating income for the third quarter increased 24% to $159.6 million from a $128.6 million last year reflecting the impact of the higher sales in our operational excellence activities. Operating margins were a record at 21.3%, a 130 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2010. Net income was up 27% to $98 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.60 were up 25% over the last year’s third quarter. Orders in the third quarter were up 5% organically and 3% overall, the acquired backlog is excluded from last year’s third quarter orders were up 8% overall. Operating cash flow in the quarter of $137 million was a record representing a 120% increase over last year’s third quarter. Free cash flow was a $125 million or 128% of net income. Working capital management was excellent. Operating working capital was 17.5% of sales matching our best ever levels. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments groups had an excellent third quarter. Sales were up 21% to $409.5 million on continuing strength in our process, power, and industrial businesses and the contribution from the Atlas Material Testing Technology acquisition that we completed last November. As expected, our oil and gas businesses were very strong. Internal growth for EIG was 12%, acquisitions added 7% to sales while currency added 2%. EIG’s operating income increased 23% to $102.4 million. Operating margins were very strong at 25%, up 40 basis points over the last year’s third quarter. The electromechanical group also had an excellent third quarter. Sales were up 11% to $341 million on strength in our differentiated businesses and the contribution from the acquisition of Avicenna Technology and Coining. Internal growth was 3%, acquisitions added 7% to sales while currency added 1%. EMG’s operating income increased 22% to $68.4 million. Operating margins were strong at 20% up 180 basis points over the last year’s third quarter. These were record operating margins for EMG. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company and our focus on cost and asset management has been the key driver to both of our competitive and financial success. Operational excellence has many facets within our company including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma, and our factories or back office operations, design for Six Sigma, and our new product development efforts, and the movement of production to low cost locals. We also continue to drive lower cost through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. From the sourcing activities, we’ve recognized $8 million in savings in the third quarter and expect $29 million in savings for all of 2011. These efforts were key drivers in the record operating margins in the third quarter. Global and Market Expansion to (Kim) continues to be a driver for AMETEK’s growth in the third quarter of 2011 international sales represented 50% of our total sales and international growth was very strong. Through the investments we’ve made over the last several years, sales growth in the BRIC locations was excellent at 44% in the quarter. This quarter, our third-party MRO business signed a three-year agreement with lufthansa Technik in Germany to provide MRO services on a heat transfer product lines including Heat Exchangers, Oil Coolers, and Fuel Heaters. Annual revenues for the products covered by this agreement are projected to exceed $1 million. This win represents another example of our third-party MRO businesses expanding market share. Our programmable power business booked the $1.6 million order for solar array and battery simulator system for our Russian spacecraft manufacturer. These systems will be used to support Russia’s space program. This is the first major space order flow program will be power in Russia and the combination of 10 months of strategic focus. There are two additional significant proposals currently being worked on with other Russian manufactures and are expected to close in early 2012. New product development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. We expect to spend a $139 million in 2011, up 24% over 2010, so, a very significant investment. And we’re excited about some recent introductions. AMETEK Prestolite Power released a new high frequency battery recharger for the motor power market. Prestolite Power is the largest independent manufacture of motor power rechargers and the new clips to high frequency charger adds to its extensive family of chargers. The new battery charger provides a power efficiency of greater than 92% providing any energy savings for the end user. Sales in the first year for the new Eclipse II charger is expected to total $9 million. In September, our SPECTRO business introduced the SPECTROBLUE and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. The SPECTROBLUE in ideal system for environmental laboratories establishes new levels of performance for common laboratory analysis were stability high throughput, an interrupted operation and especially low cost of ownership are important. Customer interest in news releases high and we expect is product will gain rapid market acceptance. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 20% of sales in the third quarter, up from 19% in 2010, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. Turning our intention to acquisitions. Over the last quarter, we’ve been working through a very full pipeline of potential acquisitions. And I am pleased to know that we announced two recently like our technologies, which was announced last week, an EM test which we announced this morning. Together these businesses represent $95 million an annual revenue and capital deploy of approximately $240 million. Together with the acquisitions of Avicenna Technologies and Coining earlier this year, we have now deployed approximately $425 million on these acquisitions this year acquiring approximately $185 million in annual revenue. Looking at each of these deals. Reichert technology is a privately held manufacture of analytical instruments and diagnostic devices for the eye care market headquartered in Depew New York that’s near Buffalo. Reichert had estimated annual sales of $55 million. We paid approximately a $150 million for the business. Reichert is a leader and innovator in high end instruments used by ophthalmologists, optometrists, and opticians worldwide to diagnose vision correction and eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration. Reichert is an excellent acquisition, which expands AMETEK’s business in the medical market and enable us to enter the highly attractive ophthalmic device market with an industry leader and innovator. Reichert invented the industry-standard Phoroptor refraction device used in vision correction diagnosis. They are also leader in tonometry instruments used to measure intraocular pressure, a key indicator of glaucoma. The acquisition of Reichert adds significantly to our position in the medical market and provides us with another adjacency to grow in this attractive market segment. Reichert complements our acquisitions of Avicenna Technology earlier this year and Technical Services for Electronics in 2010. Both of these businesses provide highly engineered components and connectors to the medical industry. Reichert Technology is also broadens the range of products we offer, which includes Precitech Optoform machine tools used in niche, ophthalmic, lens manufacturing. With this acquisition, AMETEK has approximately $250 million in sales to the medical market representing approximately 8% of AMETEK’s overall sales. The second acquisition is EM test, a privately held manufacturer of electronic test and measurement equipment headquartered in Reinach, Switzerland. EM test is a global leader and equipment used to perform electrical immunity and electromagnetic compatibility testing. EM test manufacturers of full line of conducted electromagnetic compatibility test equipment including electrical fast transient generators, electrostatic discharge simulators, surge generators waveform stimulators, and multifunctional generators. Its products are used in test applications by a wide range of industries to ensure that electronic and electrical products are not acceptable to external electromagnetic disturbances and did not generate electromagnetic disturbances that might affect other products or instruments. EM test is the excellent addition to our program we will power test the measurement equipment business, it serves as a valuable platform for growth in the highly attractive market for electrical immunity testing and a emissions measurement. EM test was privately held and has annual sales of approximately $41 million the price paid was $93 million. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us for the balance of 2011 and in 2012 as we see the strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We had the financial capability, managerial capability and disciplined approach to support this acquisition’s focus. Our backlog a deals is excellent. Our balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. Turning to the outlook for 2011, overall our businesses continue to perform well with our longer cycle, oil and gas, power, and aerospace businesses showing particular strength. We anticipate 2011 revenue to be up approximately 20% from 2010 and organic growth to be up low double-digit. This is an increase from our previous guidance. Earnings for 2011 are now expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.34 per diluted share, up 33% to 34% over 2010, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth and our streamlined cost structure. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $2.30 to $2.34 per diluted share. Fourth quarter, 2011 sales are expected to be up low double digits on a percentage basis over last year’s fourth quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.60 to $0.62 per diluted share, an increase of 20% to 24% over last year’s fourth quarter of $0.50 per diluted share. So in summary, our overall business performed extremely well in the third quarter of 2011. Our strong portfolio of businesses proven operational excellent capabilities and a success we’ll focus on strategic acquisitions have enabled us to perform well in 2011 and provide AMETEK with a solid foundation going forward. We have a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth. John will now cover some of the financial details and then we’ll be glad to take your questions. John?
John Molinelli – Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Frank. As Frank noted, we had an outstanding third quarter with excellent financial performance and the high quality of earnings. I will provide some further details. Selling expense were 10.0% of sales in the third quarter down from 10.2% in the prior year’s third quarter. General and administrative expenses were 1.5% of sales, below last year’s third quarter level of 1.6%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5% up slightly from last year’s third quarter rate of 28.9%. We anticipate a tax rate of between 30% and 31% for the full year 2011. As we had said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically due to positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventory, less payables was 17.5% of sales, down from 19.2% in last year’s third quarter, reflecting the great work done by our operating units to reduce the company’s investment here. Compared to last year’s third quarter, our collection cycle improved to 49 days from 52 days, and our inventory turns improved by 9%. Capital spending was $12 million for the quarter. 2011 capital expenditures are expected to be about $45 million. Depreciation and amortization was $21 million for the quarter. 2011 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $87 million for the year. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was a $137 million up 20% over the cash flow for last year’s third quarter and cash flow was up 21% on a year–to–date basis. Free cash flow was a $125 million for the third quarter representing a 128% of net income. For the full year we anticipate free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income. Total debt was $1.11 billion at September 30th down $57 million from year-end. Expenditures for acquisitions through September 30 totaled approximately $185 million. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $280 million resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at September 30 of 30.4% down from 36.2% at December 31. At September 30 we had approximately $1.06 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. This amount includes the new five year $700 million evolving credit facility we announced on September 22nd. This new facility was well received by our Grand Bank Group and replaced our previous $450 million credit facility, it provides AMETEK with a larger financing capacity and increased flexibility to support our growth initiatives. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter we acquired Reichert Technologies and EM Test. Capital deployed in these acquisitions of total approximately $240 million which brings our cumulative expenditures on acquisitions in 2011 to approximately $425 million. Also subsequent to quarter end we repurchased 1.28 million shares of stock for approximately $43 million. This is an addition to $5 million spent in the third quarter. These repurchases were inline with our stated strategy to offset the diluted impact of our benefit plans with opportunistic share repurchases. Our highest priority for capital deployment remains high positions. In summary we had an outstanding third quarter of 2011 establishing records for many key financial metrics. We are well positioned for further growth both organically and through acquisitions the strong balance sheet and solid cash flows. Bill?
Bill Burke – Treasurer and Vice President, Investor Relations: That concludes our prepared remarks and frankly we happy to take questions now. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Jim Lucas of Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets:  Thanks good morning. 
Frank Hermance: Good morning, Jim.
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets:  First two housing keeping questions, payable number and I’m sorry if I missed it but the backlog at the end of the quarter?
Frank Hermance: The payable number is 263 million, Jim.
Frank Hermance: And our backlog is 926.
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets:  Okay, thanks. And then with regards to EM Test looks a like very nice addition to power in test. You gave us a size of what medical is but I was wondering if you could talk about little bit more about the power and test platform now in terms of the total size. And how you view this platform going forward?
Frank Hermance: Yeah it’s great question, Jim. Basically the power segment after we include this acquisition is going to be about $350 million. We see a great opportunity because the power segment has been a smaller sub segment if you will within the AMETEK portfolio. And we’re looking at a number of different acquisitions to expanded this particular one really links with part of the existing power business. So we have a programmable power division that basically makes instrumentation that test power system. So it’s really in more of the test in T&M market then our other power businesses which are much more directly related to supplying are measuring power versus sort of automated type test system. So EM test is a logical fit because it also is in that general test and measurement type of market. And what you might envision over time is that we can build out both this test and measurement part of power as well as sort of the more intrinsic part of powers. So we see two growth opportunities here and we’re really looking at deals in both of those areas.
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets: All right. That’s very helpful. And then just if you could give us update on what you are saying and various pieces on the aero side given that’s been later cycle more positive storage just any update there will be greatly appreciated?
Frank Hermance: Sure, Jim. Basically aerospace is gaining steam is probably the best way to describe it, when we look at the third quarter sales organically, we’re up about mid-single digits and when we look at the fourth quarter we’re expecting high single digits. So some of the strong order intake that we got in the first half of the year, which was the aerospace related is now starting to build in terms of shipments. And if you look at the various parts of the aerospace, it really moves around quarter-to-quarter, but let me give you some data to help you understand what exactly is occurring there. If you look at the strong parts in the third quarter they were basically commercial, which was up low double digits, its obviously driven by the strength in both Boeing and Airbus and also effect that more people are flying. And also somewhat surprising is that business in regional jet was also up low double-digits. And the reason for that is not so much the market of business jets but more the fact that we have won some major programs with very large customer in business in regional aircraft which is driving our growth. Military was up low single which is not surprising and third-party MRO in the third quarter was up like mid single digits, then if we look to the fourth quarter we’re going to see some shifts in this, with third-party MRO we expect to actually be up mid-teens. We expect business in regional jets to remain strong and commercial to remain strong and military to stay probably in that low single-digit arena. So we are pretty excited in general about aerospace and that is building steam and we think it’s going be a key driver to our performance next year and as I know you’re aware the profit margins in this part of the business are extremely good.
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets:  Great. And then just one final clarification, on the commercial side could you give us an update of where you stand OE versus aftermarket roughly on a mixed basis?
Frank Hermance: Yeah. Its roughly 50-50 in terms of the amount overall and the organic growth was about the same low double-digits in each part of the business.
Jim Lucas – Janney Capital Markets:  Great, thanks a lot.
Frank Hermance:  You bet.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Robert Berry of UBS. Please proceed.
Robert Berry – UBS:  Hi guys, good morning.
Frank Hermance:  Hi Robert.
Robert Berry – UBS: Looks like a pretty broad based strength in the portfolio but I was wondering if you could just flag any incremental science of softness that you’ve seen since the last quarter and in particular what you’re seeing in Europe.
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, it’s great. Two questions, with respect to last quarter, there are really is not… (Technical Difficulty)
Operator: Please go ahead.
Frank Hermance: Everyone, this is Bill Burke, we’re back. We had a little bit of a power issue on this and here. Robert, I think you were asking your question I don’t know if we got to the end so I wanted to give the floor back to Robert Barry from UBS.
Robert Barry – UBS: Thank you. Yeah, I guess I just asked about whether since second quarter you’d seen any incremental signs of weakness in the business and in particular if you could comment on what you are seeing in Europe.
Frank Hermance: Right, Robert, what I was in the process of saying about weakness is that that really hasn’t been any major change between sort of Q2 and Q3. Our fourth year motor business is the one that basically as I’ll say return to normal sea and we’re seeing growth that is hovering around zero. But that’s in a sort of expected as we’re returning from an economic recession. In general, the portfolio is quite strong and in terms of the backlog, which is an indicator at the end of the second quarter, our backlog was $948 million. At the end of the third quarter, it was $926 million and most of that change was due to effect that was not due to any real weakening in the overall business. So, we’re pretty bullish overall on the markets, which is surely not consistent with what we read in the newspapers and listen to in the news.
Robert Barry – UBS: Great.
Frank Hermance: In terms of Europe was fine basically if you look at the overall growth of 16% in the company, the growth in Europe was 18%, the growth in Asia was 32% so, the total international growth was about 24% and that links with the U.S. growth, which was about 10% and I know that’s sounds to the 16% overall. So, in essence, our Europe is doing okay. So, we’re not seeing signs of demise in Europe and actually was sort of on the front page of the Wall Street Journal this morning. So far, so good. Now, we are obviously looking at it a very, very closely, we’ve got plans in place things we can, but right now it’s a pretty good situation.
Robert Barry – UBS: That’s very encouraging. I was wondering if I could ask about one particular end market that’s related to kind of the medical/research end market, I know we’ve seen some NIH related funding concerns impacting demand the customers either due to direct NIH funding or kind of collateral damage from uncertainty around parts of their budget. I was wondering if you were seeing any of that.
Frank Hermance: Our business is really are not linked directly to NIH funding and it has not been an issue for us and these businesses have been growing extremely well organic growth in the double-digit arena. So, we’re very pleased with the businesses we have and it’s just not a factor at least of any appreciable magnitude that we can detect.
Robert Barry – UBS: Yep and just finally can you share any color on what the margin profile is for EM test.
Frank Hermance: EM test is about the same level as the EBITDA margins of the company like the first deal is actually slightly above the EBITDA margins of the company. So, both of these are very, very good margin businesses and we also expect we can improve the margins from where they are.
Robert Barry – UBS: Okay. Any color on accretion?
Frank Hermance: Both of these deals will be slightly accretive next year and I wouldn’t assume any accretion in 2011 as a result of those deals.
Robert Barry – UBS: Yep, okay. Thank you.
Frank Hermance: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Caplan of SunTrust. Please proceed.
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust: Thanks, good morning.
Frank Hermance: Hi, Wendy.
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust: The new acquisitions, Reichert and EM test. Can you talk a little bit about what we are seeing currently in terms of the growth metrics of those two companies and also can you speak a little about the cost and revenue synergies that you expect.
Frank Hermance: Sure. In terms of growth, these businesses on the longer term are high single-digit type of growth businesses. Right now, there is actually a growth profile that’s a little bit higher than that. But I think if you model them over a business cycle that kind of high single-digit growth is the right sort of way to model the businesses. The synergies are going to be somewhat different for each of these businesses. If you look at the Reichert deal, they are very strong in the United States and very strong in Europe. But there is a huge opportunity in Asia only about 7% of their sales goes into Asia. So, we see a great opportunity to leverage our distribution system in China and the other Asian countries through facilitate their growth. We also see opportunity to improve the manufacturing efficiency in that organization. As you know, we run a very lean, very high margins, and even though this is a high margin business, we see opportunities to improve the manufacturing capability of that business. In the other business in EM test, the geographic profile is a bit different. It’s a Swiss-based company. So, we’ve got very strong sales in Europe and also very strong sales in Asia, but not strong sales in the U.S. matter of fact it’s about the same percentage, it’s about 7% of their sales is in the United States. So, we see an opportunity really in a cross distribution sense here to be able to take their products and leverage them in the United States and then conversely the part of our power business, which is in test and measurement, which is largely a U.S. base business to leverage it through EM Test distribution system in Asia and in Europe. So, we think there is really good cross distribution synergies there and similarly we think there is a ways an essence to improve the manufacturing efficiency of that company, it’s margins as I mentioned are down in line with AMETEK’s margins overall and we see potential to be able to increase those not only through the growth profile, but also through the cost side of the business. So, we’re obviously very early we just acquired the companies and our people are over there now and I know that I got an e-mail this morning, that they’re starting to have discussions about the opportunities on the synergies.
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust: Okay, thank you. And the record operating margin for EM, EIG, or for the company as the whole rather for the quarter, can you under the category of what you’re going to do from tomorrow. Do we think that there is upside to that going forward?
Frank Hermance: I do, Wendy, these levels I can remember when I first became CEO of more than 10 years ago we were talking about margins down in the 10% and 12% region. And we’re kind of very pleased obviously being up at this 21.3% kind of level. But if you just looked at two key facts and I’ll focus on 2011, which the same type of profile can carry forward. There is two drivers to these margins. The first is in essence the organic growth and contribution margin in our businesses. And for 2011 as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the organic growth is going to be up low double digits. The contribution margins in our business we basically told you to model it at 35%, I can tell you in the third quarter it was actually 42%. So, we had excellent flow through and as at our organic growth continues and we get that flow through in essence margins on the bottom-line can only go in one direction. So, we think there is leverage. The second part is our cost reductions and we put about $50 million in costs reductions through the P&L this year, a combination of our sourcing activities, which I talked about in my opening remarks as well as consolidation of facilities, value engineering, low cost locale manufacturing all the things that AMETEK has historically done. And we’re going to continue that matter of facts with the weakening of the global macro outlook, we’re going to be very aggressive next year and we’re going to put through more than $50 million in cost reductions through the P&L in 2012 we’re in the process right now to starting exactly what that number will be and where it will come from. But we want to be prepared in case things in fact do soften. So, the guidance that I’ve been giving and I’m still a very comfortable with is as we go forward modeling a number like 50 basis points is not an unreasonable think to model and hopefully we can do better than that, matter of fact this year now I think last quarter we told you for 2011, we’re to model a 150 basis points and with our strong performance in Q3, we’ve raised that not to a 160 basis points for the year. And that’s probably conservative.
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust: Great, thank you very much, Frank.
Frank Hermance: You bet, Wendy.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo: Hi, good morning.
Frank Hermance:  Hi, Allison.
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo:  Just going back to the acquisitions I know you’ve talked about programmable power and not being an area to build that but can you just give us any thoughts on the pipeline where you’re looking at in generally and thoughts on the pricing environment as well?
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, the pipeline is great. Really starting about midsummer, we saw our pipeline increase significantly, and that has continued. So, we’re pretty excited about our ability to add additional deals you can never really judge when exactly they’re going to close and even in some cases if specific deals are going to close. But I’m pretty bullish on where we are and what we can do and in terms of areas, we’re really looking across the portfolio and essentially all areas except our cost driven motor business. So, we’re looking within process that’s probably our number one area for adding acquisitions if we essentially had to choose. Aerospace is a very good place at the present time because we see strength in aerospace for the foreseeable future. If you look in our power businesses as we’ve already talked about obviously with due to their and if you go on the electromechanical side of the business we’ve been adding deals in our EMF division and in our technical motor operation and we will continue to do that. So I’m fairly optimistic and obviously as John talked about in his opening remarks we got plenty of fire power and we are going to use it and use it judiciously to continue to grow the company.
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo:  Great. And then just back to the pricing side and in our multiple becoming more realistic and how are you looking at…
Frank Hermance:  Well, they should be given the macro environment, but I’ve heard some other CEOs talk about multiples regressing. But I have not seen that yet, on the deals that we have been looking at. So multiples are from my view point still about a point of EBITDA too high, higher than I would like, and so we’re doing is looking for deals that are particularly attractive both from an organic view point and also from where we can add synergies. So that in excellence our return on investor capital is the same even paying that extra multiple point for the businesses. So just to give you a flavor, if you look at the multiples on these two deals, we paid above ten times forward EBITDA for Reichert and about nine times for EM test. And I would prefer those both of the about point lower. But we know are going get the return on investor capital on those deals, because of types of businesses they are and the synergies that I outlined.
Allison Poliniak – Wells Fargo: Great, thank you.
Frank Hermance: You bet, awesome.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jamie Sullivan – RBC Capital Markets:  Hi good morning.
Frank Hermance:  Good morning, Jamie. 
Jamie Sullivan – RBC Capital Markets: Frank, you walk through the aerospace in detail maybe you can just go through the other areas of the business as well for the third quarter and your outlook near-term?
Frank Hermance: Sure, I’ll be glad to do that. So I will start with the other businesses and EIG. In the process businesses our market performed extremely well in the third quarter. Sales were up more than 30%. We saw very strong growth across essentially all parts of the business. Oil and gas business continue to show sizable strength, but also our Ultra Precision Technology, our material analysis, and our measurement calibration technology divisions were also very, very strong. On an organic basis sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in the quarter. And if we look at all of 2011, we expect this business to grow approximately 25% with mid-teen percentage organic growth and in particular we expect very strong performance from our later cycle oil and gas businesses. So processes just really humming at this point in time. And also our powered industrial business is doing very, very well. Q3 sales were up high single digits organically with good growth across both the power and the industrial parts of the business. So good strength we were very pleased with that and we started out very strong in this business and we expect that sales were powered industrial will be up high teens organically in 2011 really driven by strength in the later cycle power business but also good strength in our industrial business. So to sum up all of EIG including will I talked about for aerospace for EIG we know expect 2011 overall sales to be up more than 20% with mid-teens organic growth and that is actually an increase overall previous guidance both on overall sales and also an organic growth. Moving to the other half of the company, the electromechanical group for our differentiated EMG businesses, overall sales were up mid-teens on a percentage basis in Q3 with mid single-digit organic growth. And for 2011 we expect this business to be up approximately 25% driven by strength and actually all of the major parts of the differentiated business, technical motors, EMF and also our third-party MRO business. And for the full year we expect organic growth to be up about low double digits. And the last part I have already talked bit about talked bit above which is cost driven motor business that as now less than 10% of AMETEK its our legacy business for those view that knew with us. And its return to what I would call more normal trend in 2011 after a strong growth in 2010. For 2011, we expect the business to be about flat and Q3 sales were down just slightly just down low single digits. So, as you know we don’t manage that business for growth, we manage it much more for profitability. So for all of EMG then, we are now expecting 20% growth in 2011 with organic growth up in that high single-digit arena and if you saw EMG and EIG for AMETEK is a whole in 2011, we’re expecting approximately a 20% sales increase with organic growth of low double-digits and again both of those are increases from our previous guidance. So, we’re feeling quite good as we’ve gone through the third quarter about our prospects for the year. I hope that helps.
Jamie Sullivan – RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much.
Frank Hermance: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning. Frank, you’d commented in your discussion on the aerospace piece of the business, I wasn’t clear that was relegated to EIG or the whole company when you were talking about the military side of the business still being up and I guess when I’m trying to get that, could you just sort of review where your exposures were at from an instrumentation and electromechanical group standpoint to the military and defense markets. How much your business that is today and I guess how we should think about that heading in the next year.
Frank Hermance: Yeah, the military business is largely on the EMG side of the business and it’s roughly a third of our overall aerospace business in terms of the full company. So, we’re looking and as I mentioned we saw low single-digit growth in Q3, we’re expecting sort of low single digits in Q4. We have not rolled up our budgets yet for that part of the business, but I’m actually expecting this business to be up low to mid single digit next year, that’s my sort of thought process without yet having the benefit of going through the budget with the people are running that business. So, it’s not going to be the prime driver to growth in aerospace, what is going to be the prime driver is our commercial and related to that the third-party MRO businesses, commercial aerospace is just doing extremely well if you look at this year, Boeing volume is going to be up about a 11% and Airbus is going to be up about 3%. Both of them are projecting growth next year of essentially 10% to 11% and they are going to between and they are going to produce about a 1150 aircraft so, we had not – we saw a bunch of the orders come through in the first half of the year and we’re starting to see our shipments rise as they’re getting obviously prepare to ramp-up their production rates and they seem to be repetitively announcing further aircraft bill rates out in 2012 and 2013 so, this is going to be a key part of the business that’s going to grow and also the third-party MRO business. We expect that to be up this year in the mid-teens to low double-digits actually it’s low double digits as I look at my sheet here and we think that’s going to be great perform next year, not only because of the market rebound, but also because our ability to win share. So, those two parts of the business which are in excess of 50% of the business are really going to be the key drivers as we go forward versus the military piece of the business.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Got it. And then Frank I think your total orders in the first couple of quarters of this year were running just under $800 million a quarter and it looks like the tapered off a bit here in Q3, can you sort of reconcile what that change in income in order rates has been driven by and I guess can you talk about overall order linearity as you move through Q3.
Frank Hermance: Yeah, order linearity was extremely good, it was linear basically, August have slightly to weaker just due to the vacation, but it basically is flat. If you look at the order trends you’re absolutely right, that went from 800 around – I think it’s around little bit less than 800, no actually was lower in first quarter, then it was about 798 or something like that 97 and it went through about 728 in Q3. However if you look at it organically from Q2 to Q3, it’s actually only down about 4% organically and that’s primarily due to Europe and an essence that part of the oil that goes on vacation for a substantial part of the third quarter. So that’s sort of a normal trend for us with Q3 orders being a little bit weaker. So, an essence we’re really not feeling any major change in the business even though, the numbers look large the $800 million to the 728 organically, it’s not that big. We had some acquisitions in the second quarter that we had acquired backlog that was in that $800 million number. So in a way, it was unofficially high I would say. So we’re feeling very, very good about the order rates in the company and as I mentioned the 728 is still organically up about 5% and again if you extract backlog from acquired businesses last year was up 8% overall. So, we’re feeling okay about the order, we don’t see any major problem, I mentioned the backlog – the backlog is hanging in there. And so, we feel pretty good.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great, thanks for the color, Frank.
Frank Hermance:  You bet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird:  Yes, two quick things and good morning.
Frank Hermance: Good morning.
John Molinelli: Good morning, Richard.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  On the incremental margin, Frank you’ve talked about that little bit earlier I think you’ve mentioned quarter was around 42% in this quarter. As you look out the ’12 if we assume maybe some shift in the mix of business perhaps process settles down a little bit, aerospace picks up a little bit is the buyer towards higher incremental margins or at least sustainable incremental margins up in this 40 plus range, if mix shifts a bit?
Frank Hermance: No your question is a very good one. And these incremental margins due tend to move around quarter-by-quarter depending on the exact mix. So, what we’ve basically told you guys or suggested to you to model is about a 35% number. I think there will be buyers from that 35% number as we go into next year in the positive direction. I think you’re exactly right that we probably are not going to see as much organic growth next year and process as what we’ve seen this year because obviously the numbers in process have been sort of off the charge. And we’ll be to having tougher comps, but I think they will pick in aerospace and there will be both of those are very high contribution margin businesses. I would be uncomfortable and telling you to take the 42% and add something to hit. But I’m very comfortable and saying the 35% should have an upward buyers.
Richard Eastman – Robert W. Baird:  Okay. And then just lastly again I want to go back for a minute to the investment that you make in RD&E.
Frank Hermance: Yes.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  Substantial, the target – a point or two points above market growth across year segments from the RD&E or is it more of maintaining leadership, which maybe give you little better price. But how should we think about that investment maybe driving better than market growth in terms of sales across your segments?
Frank Hermance:  Right, I mean fundamentally we’re driving that investment by where we can grow. And if it on a very key point as you know we are very niche focus. And not only do we want to keep our leadership in the niche is we’re in but we also want to expand to go in other area. So we actually model our development expense and if you can think of the our sort of the graph where you have two points which is existing markets and new markets on one access and if you look on the other access. And you sort of look at where that investment goes we tried a position that investment. So that we get the maximum growth and we actually have an internal strategic planning process that augments that both in terms of the development expense but also where we look for our acquisitions to get that revenue growth. If you look at our businesses and just split them the amount of investment we make in engineering on the instrument side of the business is much higher than on the electromechanical side and that’s because the instrument business is tend to be more RD&E driven and less capital intensive. But on the EMG side they are more capital intensive and less R&D focus. So, when you look at it, I didn’t look this particular quarter. But in general, we tend to invest at about a 6.5% to 7% kind of level in the instrument side of the business and more or like a 3.5% kind of level in the EMG businesses and that’s probably what we will see going forward. So, we just review this as the key lever for organic growth in the company, this and obviously the international focus. So, we’re going to continue to put investment in and as you can see we’re up 24% this year, which is a huge increase in the investment and hopefully that will pay off in spades as we go forward with the organic growth of the company.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  Excellent. And then just the last thought from the perspective of the acquisitions that you made, when you look back over the last may be 12 months here in terms of once that have been integrated now come towards organic growth. Are you still comfortable that you’re driving that margin, I think you used the number that margins would increase, I think it was a third by a third post acquisition. Are you still comfortable you’re getting that type of leverage off of those?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, John just ran the analysis. Why don’t you talk to the John.
John Molinelli: Yeah, we tract every acquisition we do at the on the anniversary and we just tag related to once for the last to hit that point and as right on the money here roughly 24%, 25% of an EBIT and that’s after you dial in the acquisition activities, the purchase accounting, the profits in inventory so, we’re driving those margins that in a spot on our price track record and we’re exceeding our models, Richard so, we’re doing well in that.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  Okay, very good.
John Molinelli: No degradation at all.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird:  Great, thank you very much.
John Molinelli: All right, Richard.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn, Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Thanks, good morning. Yeah, I know you’re still doing the 2012 plan, but you commented on some of the businesses and just from a pragmatic point of view really establishing tough constant some areas so, I think businesses outside the cost driven more as you think are really more positions to plateau may be the comment on the power industrial in particular.
Frank Hermance: Well, I actually think to a large degree except the aerospace business, as you are going to see what our call it return to normal so, I wouldn’t use the word plateau, we’re talking this year organic growth rates that are in the low double digits, we’re not going to be looking at double-digit organic growth next year and I don’t think you’re going to be seeing that from virtually any of the industrial company so, I think there is going to be a return to normal sea and I expect it’s going to happen essentially along the cycle of the business, I’ve already talked about our cost driven motor businesses which had a very short cycle businesses returning to normal sea. I think you’re going to see sort of the mid cycle businesses start returned to normal sea. We’re not seeing that yet, but I would expect that would happen as we go through next year. And I would expect the cops in the oil and gas business as I mentioned before the more difficult so, we’re not going to be seeing it that mid-teens organic growth next year, but I think it will be very good growth. And then I would expect the aerospace business is to pickup over this year so, to me it’s kind of a normal recovery at the way you would expect these businesses to perform.
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks Frank.
Frank Hermance: You bet, Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass, Longbow Research. Please proceed.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Good morning, gentlemen. Keep this quick and I assume you had some battery backup of here and there.
John Molinelli: We’re unfortunately, no.
Frank Hermance: I am embarrassed to tell you that we forgot to plug in the company and the battery ran out on the computer. So, we’re going to have to get our power business here. We actually do a battery backup in the building, but it doesn’t help, we’ve got the borrowers which are…
John Molinelli: I think you had a question.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Just real quickly most of my questions have been answered. Can you breakdown some of the margin improvements you mentioned, your operational excellence was $8 million in savings. Can you quantify how much was due to a more favorable mix of oil and gas being really strong as well as aerospace. Can you classify that?
John Molinelli:  I really don’t have numbers that I can quantify where it exactly came from. So but obviously if you look at the general areas were it came from the sourcing was very strong as you mentioned with that $8 million in the quarter. We are really ramping up the value engineering activity in the company, we trained most of our people in value engineering and those divisions where we saw substantial leverage. So that has got a positive factor in terms of what’s happening. We are also continuing to move production to low cost accounts and will probably add another $40 million plus to our low cost accounts doing the year not specifically in the quarter. So that’s key area focus in that our divisions our also some of the margin and some plan consolidations. So that’s running through the P&L another way that I can maybe answer your question as we do with that price versus cost. And in essence in the third quarter our pricing exceeded our cost increases in the business by about half of point our sales pricing was up about 2% and our cost on the input side were up above 1.5%. So we essence exceeded back light by half of point and that’s one of our goals just always at the pricing exceed the cost inflation. And that inflation includes the cost reduction that I am talking about another words with put those best through and that’s what enables us to give this.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Great. And then with the commodity cost maybe tailwind and just hope pricing continue that to be even help margins of 2012 presuming.
John Molinelli:  Yeah.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Some of the development you have, commodity cost is going to stay with that right now?
Frank Hermance:  Yeah. I mean we are not going to gain much from the fact that commodity prices have gone down. Because as we mentioned in the past we’re fairly immune to the basic commodities. And I am talking about things like nickel and steel, and iron and things of that nature because we have either put escalation costs in our contracts which are going move in both directions or we sort of we cloud based on this smart price of those particular commodities and as we go after we quote it we basically locked it in using some forward contracts. But it’s only what’s essentially in the backlog that we do that on. So we’re impervious to whether commodities go up or down, so we are not going to gain from that. But we plan on being quite aggressive on pricing next year. In the pre-budget memo that I put out I have asked for more aggressive pricing next year than this year and we think there is an opportunity to get that. So hopefully when we talked to you in January and talk about our budget for the year. You will see number that’s higher than not have percent that I talked about in terms of price exceeding cost.
Mark Douglass – Longbow Research: Okay, thank you.
Frank Hermance:  You’re bet.
Operator:  Last question comes from the line of Elana Wood, Bank of America. Please proceed.
Elana Wood – Bank of America:  Good morning everyone.
Frank Hermance:  Good morning, Elana.
Elana Wood – Bank of America: Just want go back to the 32% incremental margin, acquiring incremental margin. We do have this spread between EMG and EIG.
John Molinelli:  Its strong there EMG then it is in EIG I don’t have the numbers right my ahead but it was definitely stronger and you can see that with the bottom line incremental margins. We saw an EMG with recurred they were up 180% and an EIG which as much higher absolute margins they were up above 40 basis points. So was definitely higher an EMG and an EIG.
Elana Wood – Bank of America: Okay. And then inform to back your comments raw material spreads and how with that price cost the 50 basis points of benefit compare to the second quarter.
John Molinelli:  I think it was 1% in the second quarter, I think it was 1%.
Frank Hermance: Its right.
Elana Wood – Bank of America: Okay. And then just lastly this is the question for John, pension what should we through preliminary be modeling in terms of pension headwind for next year assuming discount rates stay relatively flat versus where we are today. 
John Molinelli: We don’t see a major problem at pensions as you know that there is a lot of other assumptions going to that premature to get guidance but we’re over funded in the pension plans and I think that next year will be able to manage our way through that just buying a lot.
Elana Wood – Bank of America: Okay. So, you’re suggesting that will not be a headwind or.
John Molinelli: It maybe but as we got other winds going in different directions. So we’re not that concerned about pension, we’ve got strong funding there, so we’re okay.
Elana Wood – Bank of America: Okay terrific. Thank you.
Frank Hermance: You bet.

Frank Hermance: Thank you, Bill. AMETEK had a tremendous second quarter. We established quarterly records for sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Orders in the second quarter were strong, up 24% to $797 million. Book-to-bill was 1.05 and backlog of 948 million was an all-time high.  Sales in the second quarter were up 28% to $758.8 million, internal growth was very strong at 14%, while acquisitions added 12%, and currency added 2% to sales.  Operating income for the second quarter increased 36% to $157 million from $115.6 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher sales and our operational excellence activities.  Operating income margin of 20.7% was a 120 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2010.  Operating margins include $5.2 million in cost associated with the performance-based accelerated vesting of restricted stock, which resulted from the doubling of our stock price from the April of 2009 grant date. Excluding these cost, operating margins in the quarter were a record 21.4%. Net income was up 40% to $94.1 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.58 were up 38% over last year’s second quarter.  Operating cash flow in the quarter of $115 million was superb, representing a 30% increase over last year’s second quarter.  Free cash flow was $105 million or 111% of net income. Working capital management was excellent. Operating working capital fell to 17.5% of sales, our lowest level in my tenure as CEO.  Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. Electronic Instruments group had a tremendous second quarter. Sales were up 31% to $407.4 million on continuing strength in our process, power, and industrial businesses, and the contribution from the Atlas Material Testing Tech acquisition that we completed in November.  As expected, our oil and gas businesses were very strong. Internal growth for EIG was 21%, acquisitions added 7% to sales, while currency added 3%. EIGs operating income increased 38% to $101.5 million. Operating margins were very strong at 24.9%, up 110 basis points over last year’s second quarter. The Electromechanical group also had an excellent second quarter. Sales were up 25% to $351.5 million on strength and our differentiated businesses and the contribution from the acquisitions of Technical Service for Electronics, Haydon Enterprises, Avicenna Technology, and Coining.  Internal growth was 6%, acquisitions added 16% to sales, while currency added 3%.  EMG’s operating income increased 32% to $69.2 million, and operating margins were very strong at 19.7%, up 120 basis points over last year’s second quarter.  Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company, and our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success.  Operational excellence has many facets within AMETEK, including lean manufacturing, Six Sigma, and our factories and back office operations, design for Six Sigma, and our new product development efforts, and the movement of production to low cost locals.  We also continue to drive lower cost through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. From these sourcing activities, we recognize $7 million in savings in the second quarter and expect $28 million in savings for all of 2011. These efforts were key drivers in the very strong operating margins in the second quarter. Global and Market Expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEKs growth. In the second quarter of 2011, international sales represented 51% of our total sales. Organic growth in Asia was very strong at 34%, while Europe also showed double-digit organic growth. Through the investments we’ve made over the last several years, sales growth in the BRIC locations was excellent at 47% in the quarter. AMETEK of Brazil was the winning bidder to provide Petrabrass with battery backup systems, batteries, and battery rechargers over the next three years for the Comperj Petrochemical Complex in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. Comperj’s is a large-scale refinery, a petrochemical facility which will have a capacity to refine 165,000 barrels of oil per day. This equipment will be used in various critical applications across the facility and represents a multi-million dollar opportunity for AMETEK. AMETEK’s Programmable power business produces a wide variety of simulators to test both space and ground base [inaudible] power systems. In the second quarter, we delivered a 97 kilowatt system to a Chinese research institute, our largest solar array simulator ever. This system can precisely simulate the behavior of a solar panel under a wide variety of conditions, enabling spacecraft testing to be as accurate as possible. New Product Development is a key to our long-term health and growth. We’ve consistently invested in RD&E. We expect to spend $136 million in 2011, up 21% over 2010. And we’re excited about some recent introductions. Hamilton Sundstrand has selected AMETEK’s fuel flow transmitter with a Pratt & Whitney PW1000G Geared TurboFan engine. This engine is one of two being offered by Airbus to power its new A320 NEO aircraft. The same engine has also been selected to power the Bombardi AC series aircraft, and the Mitsubishi MRJ aircraft. Estimates are that as many as 10,000 of these engines will be built, representing up to $60 million in revenue for AMETEK over the life of the program. In June, Vision Research booked their largest ever order. A U.S. military test range purchased over $3 million of high-speed cameras and accessories for use in missile launch applications. The order includes a combination of Phantom 65s, a digital camera with very high resolution, and Phantom 341s a recently-introduced camera ideal for use with telescopic tracking mounts. The order consisted of more than 20 cameras plus accessories and service contracts. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 21% of sales in the second quarter, up from 19% in 2010, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisitions of Avicenna Technology and Coining, acquiring $90 million in annual revenue and deploying nearly $185 million in capital. The first acquisition was Avicenna Technology, Inc., a privately-held supplier custom components used in a medical device industry. Avicenna provides us with expertise in producing fine-featured catheter and other medical components for leads, guidewires, and custom medical assembly’s. Avicenna adds to our growing portfolio businesses that serve the highly-attractive medical device market and is an excellent fit with our technical services for electronics business acquired in 2010.  The combination of these two businesses positions AMETEK as the only medical interconnects provider, with integrative capabilities for the catheter, cardiac, and neurostimulation markets.  Avicenna is based in Montevideo, Minnesota, and has annual sales of approximately $25 million. And with this acquisition, medical applications comprise approximately 6% of AMETEK’s total revenue.  In May, we announced the acquisition of Coining Holdings Company, a global leader in custom-shaped preforms, micro-stampings, and bonding wire that’s used for joining electronic circuitry, packaging microelectronics, and providing thermal protection and electrical conductivity for a wide range of electronic devices. Coining’s products are used in highly-engineered applications for the RF microwave, photonics, medical, aerospace and defense, and general electronic industries. Coining’s an outstanding addition to AMETEK’s business portfolio, and a really good fit with our engineered materials, interconnects and packaging businesses. Coining’s unique proprietary manufacturing processes, mesh well with our existing specialty metals capabilities. Coining is based in Montville, New Jersey, and has annual sales of approximately $65 million. Acquisitions will continue to be a focus for us during 2011 as we see this strategy as a key driver to the creation of shareholder value. We have the financial capacity, managerial capability and disciplined approach to support this acquisition’s focus. Our backlog a deals is excellent, balance sheet is strong, and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. Okay, now turning to the outlook for 2011, we expect our businesses to continue to show solid growth in 2011 with our longer cycle, oil and gas, power, and aerospace businesses showing particular strength.  Our record backlog, strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational excellence capability, and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions should enable us to continue to perform well in 2011.  We anticipate 2011 revenue to be high teens on a percentage basis from 2010, and organic growth to be up at least high single digits.  Earnings for 2011 are now expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.34 per diluted share, up 31% to 33% over 2010, reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth and our streamlined to cost structure. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $2.20 to $2.25 per diluted share. Third quarter, 2011 sales are expected to be up approximately mid-teens on a percentage basis from last year’s third quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.57 to $0.59 per diluted share, an increase of 19 to 23% over last year’s third quarter of $0.48 per diluted share. In summary, our overall businesses performed extremely well in the second quarter of 2011. We expect top and bottom line growth to continue in 2011 as our longer cycle, higher profit businesses show particular strength and the benefits from recent acquisition are fully realized.  We have a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to make sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for future growth.  John will now cover some of the financial details and then we’ll be glad to take your questions. John?
John Molinelli: Thanks, Frank. As Frank noted, we had an outstanding second quarter with excellent financial performance and a high quality of earnings. I will touch on some further details.  Selling expense was up in line with the growth in sales. General and administrative expenses were 1.8% of sales, essentially unchanged from last year’s second quarter. Excluding the cost associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock, G&A was 1.5% of sales, down significantly from last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.4% up slightly from last year’s second quarter rate. We anticipate of a rate between 30 and 31% for the full-year 2011. As we have said before, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full-year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventory, less payables was 17.5% of sales, down from 19.6% in last year’s second quarter, reflecting the tremendous work done by our operating units to reduce the company’s investment there.  Compared to last year’s second quarter, our collection cycle improved to 50 days from 53 days, and inventory turns improved by 11%. Capital spending was $10 million for the quarter. 2011 capital expenditures are expected to be about $45 million. Depreciation and amortization was $21 million for the quarter. 2011 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $87 million for the full year. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $115 million, up 30% over last year’s second quarter. Free cash flow was $105 million for the second quarter, representing 111% of net income. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow to be approximately 115% of net income. Total debt was $1.21 billion at June 30, up $42 million from year-end. Expenditures for acquisitions have totaled nearly $185 million for the first half of this year. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalence of $197 million, resulting in a net debt-to-capital ratio at June 30, of 33.8% down from 36.2% at December 31.  At June 30, we had approximately $500 million of cash and existing credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives.  In summary, we had an outstanding second quarter of 2011, establishing records from many key financial metrics. We’re well positioned for further growth, both organically and through acquisitions, with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.  Bill?
Bill Burke: Sovanna, that wraps up our prepared remarks and we’ll be happy to take folks question now. 
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets: Thanks. Good morning, all. 
Frank Hermance:  Hi, Jim. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets: John, first question, payables? 
John Molinelli :  Sure, Jim, 267 million. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets: All right, thanks. And Frank, you talked about orders up 24%, what were the – what as the organic order rate in the quarter? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, the organic growth rate was approximately 10%. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets: Okay. And when you look at the various – both geographies and markets, have you see any sort of changes, either positive or negative, in any of the major end markets, or is it a continuation of the trends from last quarter? 
Frank Hermance:  It’s really a continuation of the trends from last quarter, Jim, that’s – the best way I can describe what it occurring in the entire portfolio is that we’re beginning to see a return to normalcy with some of our short cycle businesses, you know, showing that now our mid-cycle businesses right now are performing extremely well, and with the order rates, in particular, or aerospace business, we’re really starting to crank up and sales will increase in the second half of the year going into next year. So it’s a very normal recovery that we’re seeing.  But in general, all of the key end markets are extremely good. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets: Okay. And with regards to aerospace, could you just give us a little bit of a deeper drive there; what you’re seeing by the various major markets of OE, commercial versus aftermarket as well a military, et cetera /
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, sure. I’d be glad to so that, Jim.  In the second quarter, aerospace overall was up mid-single digits in terms of sales. But the key thing is that orders were up mid-teens on a percentage basis with really commercial, military and third-party MRO all showing good growth. So when we look forward now to the second half of this year, we expect, if you look at the second half of 2011, or over the second half of 2010, we’re expecting high single digit growth rates.  So – and that’s not an improvement over what we saw in the in the first half of the year. So the backlog is building, just as it normally would in recovery, and our sales are going to escalate and we’re going to have a strong second half. And going into the first half of next year, aerospace looks very good.  If you break it down a little bit in regards to your question, the third-party MRO business, which is about 35% of our total business, is doing very, very well. They were organically in sales up low double digits and for the year, we’re expecting profitability – or expecting orders to be up mid-teens.  The commercial business, which is about 20% of our overall business, extremely good. Our orders were actually up about 50% in Q2 over this year versus Q2 of last year. And for the full year, we’re estimating they’re going to be up about 25%.  And even military is, which is now only about a third of our overall aerospace business, had low-single digit sales growth in the quarter. So you know, we’re not seeing any tremendous issue around our military business.  And we’re starting to see a rebound in orders in business and regional jets, which is about 10% of our business, and we expect that business for the year to be up low double digits.  So overall, it’s a very, very positive situation for aerospace. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets: Great. And then final question, back to your comment on seeing a normal recovery, we’ve talked about how this is not been far from normal, but in terms of the ramp and acceleration of the overall businesses, does it still look like we’re in the V at this point? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah. I think what’s happening is the V has – we’re getting to the top of the V and you’re starting to see some of the shorter cycle businesses roll over to normalcy. Where if you look at our mid-cycle businesses, they’re well, you know, in the center of the V coming up. And our aerospace businesses are basically, you know, have bottomed out and are starting to V up.  So again, it’s just a normal situation that you would expect. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Capital Markets: Great. Thank you very much. 
Frank Hermance:  You bet you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Please proceed. 
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Morning. A couple of questions, Frank. Could you talk about the linearity you’ve saw in orders from month to month throughout the quarter for the overall business? And then, I think you gave some organic growth rates in Asia and Europe. Can we also get that for the US? 
Frank Hermance: Yeah, sure. In terms of the linearity in the quarter, Matt, if you extract acquired backlog, which basically shows the organic – what’s really happening in the overall business, in essence, they were extremely linear through the quarter. Each month was within actually a few million dollars of the other months in the quarters, so very linear performance. In terms of the organic growth rates around the world, let me just take a quick trip around the world for you. In the U.S., the organic growth rate was 10%, and in Europe it was 11%, and in Asia it was 34%, which means if you look at the international growth rate, in total it was on the order of 18% and with the U.S. growth rate at 10%, that gets you to the 14% for the overall company. 
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Got it. And then just one follow-up. You went through a lot of detail in the aerospace business, can you do the same for the process, power, and industrial side of EIG, and then talk about the differentiated versus cost-driven businesses, kind of what you saw in the quarter and kind of what your expectations are for the balance of the year?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, sure, I’d be glad to do that. Process business is just a phenomenal story. They performed extremely well in the second quarter; sales were up more than 35%, it was strong growth evident across all of our process businesses. Oil and gas, as we mentioned in the press release and my opening comments, showed sizeable strengths, but also our material analysis, ultra precision technology, advanced measurement technology and measurement calibration technology, which are really all of the other divisions in this group or in this subsegment, were also very strong.  Organic sales in process were up more than 20% in the quarter. For 2011, we expect the business to grow, overall about 25%, and organic growth will be low double digits. And in particular, we are expecting continued strong performance from our leader cycle oil and gas business. Power/industrial also performed extremely well. Q2 sales that were up more than 25% organically with excellent growth across both the power and industrial parts of the business. If we look at the full year, we expect sales for power and industrial to be up at least high teens, organically in 2011, really driven by strength in our power business, but also our industrial businesses are doing quite well, but not quite as good as the later cycle power businesses.  So if you sum up all of EIG then, including aerospace, we are now expecting 2011, overall sales to be up high teens on a percentage basis, and organic growth of low double digits, and that is an increase of our previous guidance. So, very, very strong performance in EIG.  EMG also did quite well in the quarter, and if we look at the two parts of that business, per your question Matt, for the differentiated EMG businesses, overall sales were up approximately 35% in Q2 and organic sales were very strong with growth of low double digits.  If you look at the parts of that business, the improvement was driven by technical motors, but our emit businesses that I talked about in my opening comments, and also aerospace third party MRO was extremely strong. If we look forward, 2011, we expect this business to be up approximately 25% overall, and organic growth of low double digits. So, very strong performance coming out of the differentiated EMG businesses. Then, the last part of our company is the cost-driven motors business. That is now less than 10% of our sales, and that has definitely returned to what I would call a more normal trend after the strong growth in 2010.  Sales in Q2 were actually down mid-single digits. That was against a very tough comparison. In fact, Q2 2010 was by far the strongest quarter we had last year, and for 2011, we expect this business to be in the low single digits over all. And most importantly, given the sizeable cost improvements we’ve made in this business, we anticipate a double-digit increase in profit for the year for this business. So the team that’s managing this business has done a very, very good job. So if you sum that up, for all of EMG, we’re expecting high-teen growth on a percentage basis for 2011 with organic growth of high single digits. So, if you take what I talked about for EIG and EMG, for AMETEK as a whole, we expect high-teen sales growth on a percentage basis with an organic growth of high single digits, and we may very well get to low double digits for 2011.
Matt Summerville – KeyBanc: Great, thanks a lot, Frank.
Frank Hermance: You bet, Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.  
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: Hi, good morning.
Frank Hermance: Good morning, Jamie. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Europe. It looks like you saw the organic trends accelerate there from 1Q to Q2. Could you talk about the dynamics there? 
Frank Hermance: Yeah, actually, we were pleasantly surprised with our performance in Europe. Obviously, with some of the issues that are going on there, we had anticipated performance that wouldn’t be as strong as it was. And in essence, most of our business is located in Northern Europe, versus Southern Europe, and Northern Europe was quite strong. I think some of our new products as a matter of fact, I know, I don’t think – but I know that some of our new products are having tremendous success in Europe, and that has been a key driver to the growth. It was very nice to see the 10% organic growth, actually 11% organic growth in the quarter. Orders were good, so we think we will have a reasonably second half, even with the problems that are going on there.
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. And then I was wondering if you could talk about a couple of the end markets; chemical and refinery both in mature and emerging markets, just some of the customer behavior that you are seeing there.
Frank Hermance: Yeah, I mean, when we look at our business in the refining area and the chemical area in the U.S., it is largely a replacement business. There isn’t that many plants going up in the United States. And so the growth there is lower than the growth outside the U.S., although we did see growth, and I think that is really based on the fact that during the trials of the recession, these facilities in the U.S. just held back on purchasing anything they didn’t need, and now with the economy a little bit better, their output’s a little bit stronger. They are starting to purchase more of the equipment, and also our new product development efforts helped there as well because for a modest cost, in terms of their total cost to run their factories, they can upgrade their instrumentation to a higher-level instrumentation that will in essence improve their efficiency, so we are definitely seeing some of that. The real story here in these markets is outside the United States and if you look at some of our key businesses like the process business, more than two thirds of that business is outside the U.S., and that is where the real growth is coming from. Even in the refinery and chemical sectors of those businesses-so, it is a very, very positive situation. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. Thanks. Just one last quick one on the charge you mentioned for the restricted stock vesting, was there a break down net income the segments or was that all in the corporate line?
Frank Hermance: No, it is not all in the corporate line, because there was also an impact on tax. Can you guys handle that question?
John Molinelli: I can handle the group breakdown. It’s about 2.1 million in G&A, about a little less than a million in EMG and then the balance in EIG.
Frank Hermance:  And then there was also a tax impact, John. Do you know what that was? 
John Molinelli: The tax impact cost us about six tenths of a percent on the effected tax rate in the quarter, so instead of 31.4 we would have been 30.8. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Berry with UBS. Please proceed. 
Robert Berry – UBS:  Hey, guys. Good morning.
Frank Hermance: Good morning, Robert. 
Robert Berry – UBS: I actually just wanted to quickly follow-up on that chemicals question. We’ve been hearing that there is an increased potential project activity in the U.S., given how much cheap shale gas there is. Have you guys seen any rumblings of that?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, we are seeing some of that, no question about it. I think the chemical business is doing better than it was, but it still pales in comparison to what we are seeing internationally.
Robert Berry – UBS: Yep, okay. Then, I was curious about the sales outlook. It looks like you’ve been, for the past couple of quarters, tracking very well ahead of what your expectation was. I think you were looking for 20% growth this quarter, you came in at 28, but you left the outlook for sales growth unchanged. I was just wondering how you were thinking about the back half of the top line?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, that’s a great question, and I think the best way I can answer it is that with the global macro situation that we are all reading about in the news, we have been cautious about the second half of the year. And clearly, if the trends that we have seen in the second quarter continue, and I can say through at least this far in July, they have continued, those estimates could very well prove to be conservative. 
Robert Berry – UBS: Yep, okay that makes sense. Then the adjustment that you are making on the earnings guidance is reflecting what happened this quarter, and then I guess some better outlook for the margin side in the second half? 
Frank Hermance: Yeah, there is some margin improvement. It really is a mixture. We have the strong backlog that I talked about, so there is plenty of shipment capability off of that back log. And also, some of the operational excellence initiatives that we have in place are going to ramp up a bit as we go in to the second half of the year. So it really is a summation of the sales growth as well as margin improvement. 
Robert Berry – UBS: Then, I think last quarter, you had talked about G&A being down mid-single digits this year. I assume that is adjusted for that one time item in the quarter. 
Frank Hermance: What we expect for the year, is it’s going to be down about 1%, including that charge that we just talked about, and last quarter we didn’t speak to that.
Robert Berry – UBS: Okay, good, and how about on the selling side? 
Frank Hermance: Selling expenses, as John indicated, was up in line with sales and we expect that to, in essence continue. 
John Molinelli: Slightly less as a percentage, but in line with sales.
Robert Berry – UBS: Okay, then finally, can you comment on what the net impact of price versus inflation was in the quarter please? 
Frank Hermance: Yeah, we got, we feel about 2% in pricing, and when we analyzed the price versus inflation on the input side of the business, the net of that was on the order of $6 million positive.
Robert Berry – UBS: That is interesting. What are you seeing on the commodities? Is it bouncing around a lot, but net not going up a whole lot?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, it’s a mixed bag right now. We looked at the trends from Q1 to Q2 on the commodities, and nickel was up from Q1 to Q2. But if you look at steel and you look at copper, it was actually down a little bit.  So we’re seeing variations, but you may recall that we have mechanisms in the company that our profitability is pretty much independent of what happens with these commodity prices. And that’s through a number of activities, but in a number of our businesses we will actually, where there is a high level of the base commodities, we will quote at the spot price of those commodities, and then we buy forward on that material. So we’re not looking at speculating, we know we have the order, et cetera and therefore we’ve locked in the profitability of those commodities.  There could be effect on margin percentage, but it’s not going to effect the total profitability. So, you’ve never heard of us over the last – well, forever really, talking about any major impact to our bottom line from commodity shipping.
Robert Berry – UBS: Great, good position to be in. Thanks very much, and congrats on the good quarter. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next questions comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. 
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Hi. Good morning. 
Frank Hermance:  Good morning, Allison. 
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Can we just talk about margins in EIG? I think you mentioned, you know, just in a question or two before that there was a charge in passing that, but it seems like it was still down sequentially. Is that acquisition related? 
John Molinelli:  Let’s see. Yes, so sequentially, it was down as reported. I haven’t tried to calculate the impact of the restricted stock on that. I’ll have to do that offline. 
Frank Hermance:  Why don’t we do that offline for you, Allison, and then we’ll get you the question – or the answer. 
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: All right. And then just, you know, in terms of margin expansion, you guys are on track for well over 100 basis points this year. You know, looking out further, if we do settle into that sort of high single-digit growth rate on the top line, can you remind us again how we should be thinking about margin expansion? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah, we’re estimating now at least 120 basis point of margin expansion for 2011 over 2010. And as I mentioned before, if the growth rates are better than what we’re forecasting, we’ll see even more margin expansion than that. So I would say 120 basis points is a floor. 
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Great. Thank you. 
Frank Hermance:  You bet, Allison. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Caplan with SunTrust. Please proceed. 
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust Robinson: Thank you. Good morning. 
Frank Hermance:  Good morning. 
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust Robinson: It’s – well, I’m glad I didn’t have to ask the conservative question since you answered it for me. But where – if the growth rates, you know, do appear to be higher, where do you expect them to be? Where will we see that? What’s the likelihood? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah. I think it’s going to be in the later cycle businesses. We’re estimating how rapidly they’re going to grow. If the process businesses continue on the trend that they have been on, they have a good chance of exceeding the estimates that we’ve put in place.  And also, from the viewpoint of aerospace, as I mentioned, our aerospace orders have just taken off. And if that continues, it will come down to how much can we shop in this year versus the next year. So there’s definitely a possibility that those businesses could do better than we’re forecasting.  And I don’t want to leave our power businesses out of this either because the order trends were very, very good in power. And it’s also possible that we could do a bit better there.  So – and I don’t see a huge amount of downside. It really comes down to how much growth are we going to get given this macroeconomic situation that is occurring. 
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust Robinson: Okay. And headcount, can we talk about where we are versus the beginning of the year, and where are you hiring, where are you having trouble hiring? And are there any examples of where you are laying off? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah. We’re up about a 150 people extracting the acquisitions that we did this year. So that’s sort of a baseline-to-baseline employment level. It’s – well, there are predominantly salary positions, which is a change from as we were ramping up at the second part of last year. And it’s largely outside the United States, unfortunately for the U.S.  If you look outside the United States, I don’t know exactly, but it’s probably 2/3 of those hires are outside the U.S., very heavily in the BRIC countries. I have one data point in mind that the BRIC countries, we’re putting in over last year and this year, about 190 people in rough numbers. And most of those are this year. There were about 57 added last year and the remainder is going this year.  So we’re just trying to capitalize on the growth in the BRIC countries. And in terms of layoffs, we’ve had some minor layoffs that are associated with some restructuring activities. But not substantial this year. Obviously, during the downturn, we took about 20% of our entire workforce out and obviously, we are not adding back at that rate at all, and we don’t need to, in essence because we have done infrastructure restructuring and that’s why you’re seeing this phenomenal margin performance, et cetera, that we think we can maintain. 
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust Robinson: Okay. And you said salary positions, is it marketing, management – how should we think about that? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah. It’s largely sales resource in China, and in India, it’s a combination of sales and engineering resource. We now have about 50 people doing engineering work in India in our operation there. And we plan on substantially increasing that. As a matter of fact, we just leased another floor in the building that we’re in, and we expect probably by the end of next year, we’ll have over 100 people doing engineering work in India.  So those are the drivers. There are some other support people, but it’s predominately sales people, feet on the street, sales management people and engineering people.  Again, focused on growth. 
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust Robinson: Okay. And one last question, can – you usually give us the core incremental margin for the quarter. 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah. If you exclude this accelerating vesting of restricted stock, the contribution margin in the business was 37% and if you include it, it was 33%.  So the more normalized rate and what you’d expect to see going forward is above that 35% level. So very good flow through. 
Wendy Caplan – SunTrust Robinson: Okay. Thanks very much. 
Frank Hermance:  You bet, Wendy. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Please proceed. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Good morning, gentlemen. 
Frank Hermance:  Hello, Mark. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Frank, going a little bit more into power and process, can you review the demand in the power products that are region end markets? Any particular products strength that you saw? And what is it about defense? It seems like it wouldn’t be holding up as well as it is. Or is it holding up with power? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah. Let’s talk about the power business first. If you look at our power business, it’s roughly $300 million in volume and a little less than half of that is in test and measurements. And by test and measurement, I mean, these are systems that are used to test power systems in essentially another company’s manufacturing operation. So we can go into any electronics company, or for that matter, a Boeing or anybody that’s producing product and has electronic gear and our systems can automatically test it.  And that business has been the key driver, or a key driver to the growth in ours. And that reflects the general trends that you’re seeing in the test and measurement market, in a broader sense than just power.  In addition, our battery backup system, which is a large percentage of the remaining business, it’s about $100 million. They have about half of their business that actually goes in oil and gas. And when we speak about oil and gas, we don’t include that. We include that portion as part of the power business.  And that’s following the same trends that we’re seeing in our process businesses, with very, very strong growth. And the remaining piece of the business is essentially instrumentation that goes into tests and distribution and generation of power. And that’s rebounding nicely, not as strong as the other two parts that I talked about, but there’s strength across that entire power business.  The second part of your questions around defense, you may recall that we make some very good investments quite a number of years ago on both sides of our defense aerospace business. In the EIG side, we decided to invest in helicopters. It fit the capabilities of AMETEK. We saw growth opportunities in helicopters and to be very honest about it, I don’t think any of us anticipated that helicopters would be doing as well as they are. So we are riding that trend of military and not even in terms of as much wars as it is, they have to change the dynamics of their air fleet to simply put more helicopters in it.  So that business is doing well. And then the second issue on the EMT side of the business is that we are the prime supplier to the military for cooling systems on any electronic devices. You know, we have fans that are just ingrained in the military, very high-performance fans that can cool electronics. And what’s happening is there is a – even with the constraints on the budgets that we’re seeing now and that we’re going to see, the electronic content of what’s going into, in essence, the military, is simply increasing.  So even with a flat topline on military business in terms of the overall market, or even a decreasing trend with that electronics content increasing with that, we’re enjoying that. So as a result, our military business is doing okay. You know, it’s not at the same – it’s not growing at the same level as our commercial businesses that I talked about, but it’s still doing quite well and we’re optimistic, even with what’s occurring in Congress now, that we’ll be able to do well.  And again, remember, it’s only about a third of our aerospace business. So it’s, you know, it’s not a major part of our company. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Thank you. That was very helpful. And then finally, on the process side, for I guess maybe all of the process and power, what is your total exposure to Brazil? It sounds like a combination of power and process. 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah. Total sales in Brazil run over $30 million. Bill’s looking it up exactly. Am I right? 
Bill Burke:  Yeah. 
Frank Hermance: It’s $30 million, but there’s a huge opportunity here and I can expand on this a little bit. We’re in the final states of putting a lease together, so lease 100,000-plus square foot facility in Brazil and it’s a result of initially winning that large contract that I talked about in my opening remarks that concurred. But we’re going to use this facility as we have in China, as we have in Mexico and as we have in Eastern Europe, now as a location where all of our divisions will have access to do manufacturing in Brazil.  And manufacturing in Brazil is very important because there are significant tariffs that they impose on anything that is imported in. And they’re obviously trying to encourage it’s local manufacturing. So we’ve decided that in essence to further penetrate that market, it’s essential to manufacture there. So we’re starting to do that. And in addition to that, in the same facility, we’re in the beginnings of building the same type of distribution infrastructure locally that we have in China, that we have in Europe, that we have in Eastern Europe. And we just hired a general manager, a very, very strong guy, who’s going to oversee both the manufacturing and the distribution side of this business.  So we’re going to make significant investments in Brazil. We, as I think you’re aware, we’ve made significant investments in China, more recently in India and Brazil is the next part of the world that we’re going to focus on. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Great. Thanks. 
Frank Hermance:  You bet. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Yes. Good morning. Nice quarter. 
Frank Hermance:  Hi, Rick. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Frank, could you just speak for a minute or two to your exposure in Asia? We talked – you talked about the growth rate in Asia and I’m curious, you know, where AMETEK has the most exposure when you’re looking at kind of product lines or at least kind of subsegments in the business? 
Frank Hermance:  It’s basically our process businesses and our low-end floor care business. Those are the two businesses that represent the largest part of Asia markets.  Our power businesses are more in the beginning of penetrating that part of the world. I think there’s tremendous opportunity for our power businesses, but they are not at the same level of sales at this point that our process and floor care motor businesses are. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Okay. Okay. And then also just, with the recent acquisitions, you know, just a bit of a makeshift towards kind of the interconnect businesses. And then also the medical apps, or applications, kind of market. Is that intentional? Do we continue to shift the business maybe directionally that way, or is that more opportunistic based on the M&A market itself? 
Frank Hermance:  In terms of, if we look at EMG, this is strategic what we’re doing and it lines up directly with what we really have been talking about for a number of years, where when you go back in time, that segment was predominately floor-care motors. And the dynamics in that business, as we all know, is – it’s a lower growth kind of business. So strategically, we said we are going to focus on differentiated businesses that in essence can go into EMG. And we decided to essentially grow off of businesses that AMETEK already owned, although at that time had very strong levels of sales.  So we had a specialty metals business for many, many years, actually, it was acquired more than 20 years ago because it was acquired before I came to AMETEK and I’ve been here about 20 years. And a very, very good, high profit margins, and we looked at opportunities around it. And in essence, this metals focus came out of that activity.  And for many years, we’ve been talking about medical. We think that’s a good market for both instruments as well as the electromechanical side of the business. And as we looked at that, there’s opportunities on both halves of the business, but we’ve been fortunate enough to get companies that we know something about, we know a lot about metals and that type of product, and essentially, putting it into a very good market, which is medical.  So this is strategic. It’s not opportunistic. It’s opportunistic in the sense that when acquisitions fit that model, we go after them. But it wasn’t that these businesses were just available and we said, oh, let’s go there. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Okay. Okay. And then in terms of the initiative to build out the third-party MRO kind of aerospace business, obviously, very good growth. You know, my guess is M&A multiples are probably – probably reflect that good growth. But is that – are there still MRO opportunities in the M&A pipeline? 
Frank Hermance:  No question. Actually, I can tell you that we’re working on one right now and again, I’m not going to postulate whether we’ll close it or not. There’s always issues with deals, but hopefully we will. So there’s definitely additional opportunities there. They’re great businesses and actually, in terms of multiple, the multiples on those businesses are actually lower.  And the reason they’re lower, it’s not because of the growth, it’s because most of those companies don’t have the inherent ability to do PMAs and DDRs. And therefore, their margins are low because they have to essentially buy all the material from the OEMs and the OEMS mark them up.  And therefore, there’s a discount on the multiple of those businesses. So what we do, is most of those businesses we bought, I don’t know exactly, but probably in the 6 ½, 7 times trailing EBITDA, we bring them in and we do the PMAs and the DDRs so we can get the profit margins up from say 10%, 18 or 19% so they’re you know, from a return on invested capital viewpoint, they’re homeruns in essence. So the next model that – and the reasons we went after these businesses and you add that to the great growth rate, and you know, it’s very, very good business.  On the other side of this, we don’t want to have our aerospace business become just a third-party MRO business. We see it as an adjunct to our base business. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: I see. Okay. Very good. Thank you. 
Frank Hermance: You bet.  
Operator:  (Operator instructions). And our next question comes from the line of Jim Fong with Capelli. Please proceed with your question. 
Jim Fong - Capelli: Good morning, Frank and everyone. 
Frank Hermance:  Hi, Jim. 
Jim Fong - Capelli:  Frank, I just want to – just going back to aerospace, Boeing and the Airbus announce higher production rates on the airplanes as we go out to 2014 as well as, you know, new airplanes being launched. And I was wondering, could you kind of comment where your aerospace OE business is today, and how high can that go, where would that be when you get to 2014, 2015 timeframe? 
Frank Hermance:  Yeah. I think I can give you an answer to that, Jim. If we look at just commercial aerospace, it’s about 20% of our total business in aerospace. And our total aerospace business is on the order of 550 – let’s round it to $600 million. So 20% is $120 million. So that’s roughly where we are today.  And you look at these production rates and you know, this year Boeing is growing in terms of number of aircraft, about 10% and Airbus is growing about 5%. So say – and they’re roughly splitting the market, so they’ve got 7-8% growth. And then you take the aftermarket piece of this, which is going to grow in that same number. So I think if you take that $120 million number and put, excluding any additional acquisitions, you put a, you know a high single digit organic growth rate on it and roll that out, I think that’s a reasonable model for that business.  I don’t know exactly where that ends up in 2014, but I think if you did it that way that would give you a reasonable model. 
Jim Fong - Capelli: That’s terrific. And what was the margin growth? Is there any – what kind of margin expansion we could see as we go on during that time period? 
Frank Hermance:  Oh yeah, no I think definitely we can continue to do margin expansion. Just the growth, if you’ll look at the organic growth in our businesses and in response to Wendy’s questions with this greater-than 35% contribution margin, as you get the growth and that kind of contribution margin, there’s really only one place that bottom line margins can go an that’s up. So I think there’s definitely expansion there.  And I could also say that the aerospace contribution margins are higher than the company average because obviously, they’re, you know, very, very good businesses. So you know, excluding any cost activities that we’ve put in place, there’s definitely margin potential here. 
Jim Fong - Capelli: Great. Okay, thanks so much. 
Frank Hermance:  You bet. 
Operator:  And there are presently no further questions, sir, at this time. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.

We will begin today with some prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions.  I will now turn the meeting over to Frank. 
Frank Hermance:  Thank you, Bill. All of the comparisons I will discuss in my prepared remarks will be made against the 2008 results excluding the fourth quarter restructuring charge. Our press release tables detail our 2008 results with and without this charge. AMETEK had a good fourth quarter. As anticipated we saw sequentially higher sales in a number of key markets, improved earnings and continued excellent cash flow generation. Perhaps more importantly we saw significantly higher order rates from our customers. Orders in the fourth quarter were strong totaling $577 million, a 20% sequential improvement over the third quarter 2009 and a 4% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008.  Sales increased 5% sequentially and operating margins expanded 140 basis points to 17%. Cash flow was excellent for both the fourth quarter and the full-year 2009. Operating cash flow was $109 million for the quarter and $365 million for the year, up 155% and 47% respectively. Free cash flow was 161% of net income for 2009.  When compared against the fourth quarter of 2008 sales were down 16% to $523.5 million. Internal growth was negative 20%. Acquisitions and foreign currency translation each added another 2% to sales. Operating income declined to $89.2 million from $122.3 mil last year reflecting the impact of the reduced sales, partially counterbalanced by our cost reduction activities. Net income was $51.9 million or $0.48 per diluted share.  Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The electronic instruments group performed well in the fourth quarter. As anticipated, sequential sales of instruments for research and metals applications improved while our oil and gas related businesses stabilized. EIG sales were up 5% sequentially and orders were up low double digits. Operating margins were strong at 19.6%, a 200 basis point sequential improvement over the third quarter.  Compared against last year fourth quarter sales decreased 21% to $286 million. Internal growth was down 23%. Foreign currency added 2% to revenue. EIG’s operating income was $56.1miln versus $89.6 million in last year’s fourth quarter.  The electromechanical group also performed well in the fourth quarter. Sequential sales were up 5% with improvement in both our cost driven motor and differentiated businesses. Sequential orders improved in EMG by approximately 30%. Operating margins improved to 17.1%, a 10 basis point sequential improvement. When compared to the year-ago fourth quarter sales declined by 9% to $237.5 million. Internal growth was down 16%. Acquisitions added 5% to revenue while the impact of foreign currency added an additional 2% to revenue. Operating income for the quarter was down 8% to $40.7 million.  Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company and our focus on cost and asset management have been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. We are realizing the benefits of the restructuring plan we announced last January as well as the follow-on plan announced in April of last year. As part of these plans headcounts have been reduced by approximately 1,900 people since the beginning of the year and more than 2,600 people since June of 2008.  In addition to the restructuring activities we continue to drive lower costs through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. We generated approximately $22 million in incremental savings this year from these activities with $6 million in the fourth quarter. Overall, the total impact of the operational excellence initiatives outlined was approximately $135 million in reduced costs for 2009.  We continue to invest in global and market expansion and new product development. These initiatives have helped our performance during the downturn and position us to perform well during the upturn. Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK’s growth over the business cycle. In the fourth quarter international sales represented 50% of our total sales.  As an example of global expansion, Tenaga National Power (TNP), the national power company of Malaysia has approved solid state controls solar digital process power inverter for use in their micro solar power systems. TNP has been steadily deploying micro solar power plants to various villages and school systems throughout the remote regions of Malaysia. They have concluded our power converter is a superior product to handle the rugged environment those micro solar plants must operate in. AMETEK expects to become the primary source of supply to TNP with a solar inverter with several million dollars in potential sales.  New product development is the key to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. This year the total is $101 million down slightly from last year. While no single new product is significant to AMETEK as a whole, we are excited about some recent introductions. Aerospace and defense’s Hughes-Treitler business unit has been selected to provide the surface cooler package for the Pratt & Whitney pure power engine to be used for the Mitsubishi regional jet. The surface cooler package consists of four, double sided oil coolers per engine on this twin engine aircraft. The value per aircraft ship set is $34,000 and the potential revenue is $25 million over the life of the program.  During the quarter our Ortec business unit released and delivered the first laboratory detector module for measuring nuclear radiation. This module is a mechanically cooled high purity germanium detector based on the micro detector technology deployed for Homeland Security applications. The laboratory detector module is designed for use with our traditional counting laboratory customers such as nuclear power plants. The mechanically controlled cooler eliminates the need for liquid nitrogen providing lower cost and ease of maintenance.  From an overall perspective revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 19% of sales up from 18% last year, reflecting the excellent work of our business in developing the right products to serve their customers.  In the fourth quarter we announced we acquired the pressurized gas systems business of Ameron Global. This business is a manufacturer of highly engineered pressurized gas components and systems for commercial and military aircraft customers. In addition they are a leader in the maintenance, repair and overhaul of fire suppression and oxygen supply systems. The business had annual sales of approximately $20 million. This acquisition broadens the reach of our aerospace and defense business. The business serves a wide variety of commercial aircraft and defense customers. Their products complement our existing aerospace safety products and offers us important growth opportunities in fire detection, fire suppression, oxygen supply and other safety systems.  Ameron Global operates three facilities across the United States for the maintenance, repair and overhaul of fire suppression and oxygen supply systems, adding complementary and differentiated capabilities to our existing global MRO network. Coupled with other recent AMETEK MRO acquisition and expansion activities we had a significant and growing presence in this attractive market.  For the year we closed four acquisitions totaling more than $50 million in annual revenue, a relatively light year for us. Closing only the Ameron deal in the fourth quarter was a disappointment. At the time of our third quarter call we had two additional deals in due diligence we expected to close or announce by the end of the year. However, as we approached year-end both of these deals were terminated. One, due to issues raised in due diligence. In a second case the private seller decided not to sell at this point in time. We are now focused on other deals in our backlog.  In fact, we announced today the acquisition of Sterling Ultra Precision, a small, privately held reseller of machine tools for the optic lens market located in Tampa, Florida. Sterling currently bundles AMETEK’s Precitech Optiform Machine tools with proprietary software and specialty fixtures that are used in the design and manufacture of contact lens, contact lens molds and intraocular lenses. While this is a small acquisition, the acquisition of Sterling Ultra Precision provides us with an attractive opportunity to gain direct access to the highly profitable niche optic lens market.  I would expect us to close a larger number of deals in 2010. We have the financial, managerial capacity and disciplined approach to support this acquisition’s focus. Our balance sheet is strong. Our cash flow and our financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy.  Turning to the outlook for 2010, we expect our markets overall to show modest growth during 2010 with this growth becoming more evident as we move through the year. We believe that AMETEK’s strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, lower cost structure and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions will enable us to perform well in 2010.  We anticipate 2010 revenue to be up low to mid single digits on a percentage basis from 2009. Earnings for 2010 are expected to be in a range of $2.10 to $2.20 per diluted share, up 10-15% over 2009 reflecting the leveraged impact of core growth and our streamlined cost structure. First quarter 2010 sales are expected to be down mid single digits on a percentage basis from last year’s first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.45 to $0.47 per diluted share as compared to last year’s first quarter of $0.55.  In summary, our overall business has stabilized and shown signs of improvement. We delivered good results for the fourth quarter in the face of better but still challenging market conditions. Our restructuring initiatives have resulted in a streamlined cost structure that should enable us to drive higher margins going forward. We have a strong balance sheet that generates significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. In addition to acquisitions we continue to make sizeable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for growth.  John will now cover some of the financial details and then we will be glad to take your questions. 
John Molinelli :  Thank you Frank. As Frank has covered our results at a high level I will focus on some particular areas of interest. Similar to Frank, all comparisons will be made against the 2008 results excluding the fourth quarter restructuring charge.  Selling expenses were down 14% in the fourth quarter in line with the sales decline. Corporate G&A was down 34% from last year’s fourth quarter in absolute dollars and fell to 1.4% of sales as compared to 1.8% of sales in last year’s fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.5% and was 30.2% for the full year, both in line with our expectations and driven by worldwide tax planning initiatives. We anticipate a rate of between 31-32% for 2010 with the first quarter having, as is typical, the highest rate of the year.  Our defined benefit plans are overfunded as a result of excellent investment performance and contributions we made in 2008 and 2009. We expect that the 2010 contributions to our defined benefit plans will be minimal, totaling about $3 million.  On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 21.2% of sales for the fourth quarter; a sequential improvement and down from last year’s level of 21.8%. We continue to see an opportunity to reduce our working capital investment and this will be an area of focus for us in 2010.  Capital spending was $12 million for the quarter and $33 million for 2009 or 1.6% of sales. Expenditures for capital in 2010 are expected to be about $40 million. Depreciation and amortization was $17 million in the quarter and $66 million for 2009. For 2010 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $70 million.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $109 million up from $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $97 million representing 187% of net income. For the year 2009 operating cash flow was $365 million, up 47% over 2008 and free cash flow was 161% of net income.  Total debt was $1.04 billion at December 31, down $70 million for the year. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $246 million resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at year-end of 34% as compared with 44% at the end of last year. Fourth quarter results reflect the repayment of $17 million of debt and expenditures of $32 million for acquisitions.  We have expended a significant amount of effort to improve the company’s capital structure and to insure that adequate liquidity was available to support our growth plans. The result of this work is that AMETEK has plenty of liquidity available and only one debt maturity in 2010 of approximately $80 million. At quarter end we had approximately $700 million of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Clearly liquidity is not an issue for AMETEK.  In summary, we continue to manage our cost structure and balance sheet effectively, maintaining a strong liquidity profile and positioning ourselves to support our core growth strategies. Bill? 
Bill Burke :  Thanks John. Operator, that completes our prepared remarks and we would be happy to take questions now. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more as we think sequentially with the first quarter guidance revenues flat to up sequentially, what some of the puts and takes are on the cost side we should be thinking about?
Frank Hermance :  If you look at the first quarter as you indicated sales will be relatively flat from the fourth quarter. With those essentially flat sales our cost reductions are in place and the main change in earnings is due to the tax rate John talked about where the first quarter tax rate is going to be higher as is typical in any first quarter for AMETEK. So that is the prime driver as to what is causing that. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: I wonder if you could talk about the orders in the quarter improving pretty significantly. Where you saw particular strength in the orders? 
Frank Hermance :  It was very broad based which was actually a delight for us to see. Prior to the fourth quarter we had seen a few pockets that were encouraging but in the fourth quarter it was very, very positive across the company. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, in EIG orders were up low double digits and in EMG they were up about 30%. If you look at the sub-segments they were really up in each of the major sub-segments we talked about. It was good performance. 
Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets: Any sense for how much stimulus spending or incentives may have contributed to those end markets? 
Frank Hermance :  It is very, very difficult to quantify that. I would say the one area where we definitely as anticipated saw some impact of not just the stimulus spending but also the government spending activity was in the research part of our process businesses but that wasn’t the prime driver of why we saw this increase. I believe we are seeing a global improvement in our businesses. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: A couple of quick housekeeping questions. Payables at year-end? 
John Molinelli :  $192 million. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott:   When you talked about liquidity what was the total available under the revolver you referenced? 
John Molinelli :  The total I gave you was $700 million which combines cash and the revolver. It is a combination of everything. We have nothing drawn against our revolver. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: I wanted to ask a couple of strategic questions here. We have seen a couple of the acquisitions including Sterling this morning and this kind of more of a distribution related type. Has there been any change in terms of how you are looking at some of the smaller, bolt-on acquisitions? Could you give us any color on what you are seeing out there? I would also be interested if you could give any color what specifically came up in the due diligence that made you walk away from the deal in the fourth quarter. 
Frank Hermance :  In terms of the bolt-on’s first there is no real change in our strategy. We are continuing to pursue those acquisitions that are in the $50-150 million annual sales types of levels. But yes we do see opportunity within that strategy to do some of these smaller deals that basically expand our distribution capabilities. Several of the acquisitions we recently announced, particularly the one in India, is a real attempt to gain sales and distribution infrastructure in places where we don’t have it.  The Sterling announcement this morning, this was a company we have worked with for a number of years and this gains us direct access to their customers. This is not a change in our strategy but really an opportunity to gain distribution capability around the world. As a matter of fact when we look at some of the added investments we are going to put in place in 2010 one of the areas we are going to substantially invest in is the BRIC countries and in particular distribution. We will be spending money to expand in India, to continue our expansion in China and do some expansion in Russia, etc. because we see great opportunities to gain share and take advantage of the market growth rates in some of those countries.  In terms of what we are seeing in the backlog, the backlog and the deal environment has definitely improved. I think I referenced that in my third quarter conference call and I feel even more strongly about it today. It is not back to where it was before the downturn but it is much better than what it was during the beginning of 2008. While 2008 we didn’t do any deals of the size and quantity we would like it wasn’t because we didn’t want to. Those deals simply weren’t available or as I mentioned we did run into some issues with a couple of those deals at the end of the year.  So to expand a little bit on the last part of your question one of those deals fell out of bed simply because the private seller decided he did not want to sell the business. There were really no problems with in essence the negotiation or the approach that was taken by actually either party. That was just a personal decision. The second one, as you know we do very extensive due diligence work on the deals we look at. I don’t think it is appropriate to get into the details of that but we found some fairly significant problems that would have not been in the best interest of our shareholders. They were significant enough that we felt that even a sizeable price reduction on the deal was not the right approach.  Although we were disappointed on the other hand it is the right decision and I think it shows our disciplined approach that we are not afraid to walk away if in essence something is not in order. 
Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: One quick follow-up, you mentioned some increase in 2010 and on the BRIC you have spoken in the past of Russia, India and China. Any updates you can give us on your Brazil strategy? 
Frank Hermance :  That is an excellent point. We spent some time at the end of last year on our strategic acquisition and strategic marketing work and we Brazil there is opportunity for us. We have an operation in Brazil and we see an opportunity to expand that. In fact, as we speak we are looking at another one of those smaller acquisitions that would in fact expand our capability there and some of the investments I have talked about will go in to adding additional sales and resources in that part of the world.  We have prioritized over the last several years where we want to make these investments. China was clearly number one because of the growth there. We then went to the Middle East and Russia mainly because of our concentration in oil and gas. We think next is obviously India and we are making those sizeable investments. We did it last year and we are going to do more this year. Not because the opportunity isn’t there but Brazil is the next one on the list. We are going to do some investments there but as time goes on you will hear more and more from us about Brazil. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass - Longbow Research. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Could you drill down into the sub-segment details in the quarter? Then as well, what you are baking into your 2010 for those sub-segments? 
Frank Hermance :  Let’s start with aerospace. Our aerospace markets are relatively healthy. As anticipated in Q4 our overall aerospace business was flat with respect to Q3. With respect to the fourth quarter of 2008 aerospace saw mid single digit negative growth due primarily to the weakness in commercial aircraft and business and regional jet markets. Very importantly I would say for 2010 we expect aerospace to be roughly flat predominately as our military and third-party MRO businesses counterbalance weaker commercial and business and regional jet markets. So it is pretty much what we outlined for you at the end of the third quarter.  I think we are even more convinced now the performance of aerospace for 2010 is not going to take a major dip as is pretty much characteristic of previous downturns in aerospace. We are actually very delighted that we are looking at growth that is roughly flat for 2010 and obviously with the sizeable cost reductions we put in place we are going to see improved earnings out of our aerospace businesses.  In terms of the process markets, our process markets performed as we expected in the fourth quarter with sequential improvement in sales of instruments to the research and metals market while our oil and gas businesses stabilized. I think when I was asked about risk in the third quarter conference call we had anticipated the oil and gas businesses to stabilize but there was some risk in that and in essence it has happened. We are very encouraged by that and our order intake as I mentioned in response to a previous question was also very strong. So we are feeling much better about this segment.  In terms of numbers, sales are up high single digits sequentially in the quarter. On a quarter-over-quarter basis sales were down approximately 20% for this sub-segment. What our expectations are for 2010 to the point of your question is we expect this business to grow in the low single digits.  For power and industrial, Q4 sales were up sequentially high single digits. That improvement was driven by our power business. With respect to the fourth quarter 2008 power and industrial sales were down approximately 20%. Just as a point of reference, industry data showed heavy trucks down 26% in the quarter. 2010 truck build are expected to be 123,000 trucks, up about 4% over 2009. Looking forward to 2010 we expect sales for power and industrial to be up approximately 10%.  Switching over to EMG, looking at those two sub-segments for our differentiated EMG businesses Q4 sales were sequentially up mid single digits. The improvement was driven by aerospace, technical motors and our [EMID] businesses which are essentially all the businesses in that sub-segment. With respect to the fourth quarter of 2008 sales were down approximately 10%. For 2010 we expect this business to be up mid single digits.  The last part of our company is the cost driven motor businesses. As anticipated and what we said in the third quarter conference call is this business improved on a sequential basis. Sales were up actually low double digits for this business. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Q4 organic growth was down low double digits. For 2010 we expect this business to be up low single digits.  I think even though I have given you a fair amount of detail here I think one of the most important things is that we were able to call in the third quarter exactly what occurred in the fourth quarter within very modest fluctuations. There is no question that our business has stabilized and it doesn’t feel the same as it did in the first half of 2008 where at times we, as well as many companies, felt they were almost in freefall. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: A question on your profitability. If you look at the fourth quarter versus second quarter 2009 sales are on par yet your earnings were down but there was restructuring in between the two quarters. Can you explain, was it mix? 
Frank Hermance :  There was definitely a mix shift that I think were not picked up by some people on the street. We were shipping from backlog for aerospace and our process businesses which in essence got weaker as the year went on and now we are building up the backlog in those businesses again and they are obviously very high margin businesses for the company. So that is the predominant driver for that shift. There may have also been…is there any tax right there? 
John Molinelli :  A little bit, yes. 
Frank Hermance :  So not a lot on tax rate. So predominately it was the aerospace and process businesses. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research: Just looking at operating margin it declined 80 basis points from second quarter. 
Frank Hermance :  That is driven, and obviously with the sizeable cost reductions we have put in place the impact would have been significantly more if those improvements were not put in place. 
Mark Douglass - Longbow Research:  On process, I guess I was a little surprised you are thinking low single digits in 2010. Are you just not seeing the instrumentation getting picked up by oil and gas as strongly as maybe would be implied with oil back to $70-80? 
Frank Hermance :  I think the best way to answer that question is we are not yet declaring victory. We have had one very good quarter of order intake. We feel better about next year and we want to just see another quarter of performance at that level before in essence we consider raising what we think we can do next year. Hopefully if things continue the way they have we will be in a position to possibly improve our outlook as we go through the year. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer Funds. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer Funds: I was going to go further into the orders and top line outlook. I think if you extrapolate the orders it leads to much higher run rates. So I am just wondering if particularly in EMG with a lot of OE customers maybe you experienced a significant restocking? Then maybe any color on the January follow through? 
Frank Hermance :  That is a great question. There definitely was some restocking impact but that was not the predominate driver. I think one thing you do need to keep in perspective is that when we look at any given year and you look at our historical performance with last year I would say being an exception, typically our first quarter in terms of EPS is the weakest quarter that we have. We are definitely seeing some of that impact here. There is also, as I mentioned, some potential conservatism in the fact that in essence we have only seen a quarter of this sort of order improvement and we want to make sure that it is real. I think that is the best way I can answer your question. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer Funds: January follow through, any comments there? 
Frank Hermance :  Yes it was quite good. So far very good. 
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer Funds: As far as some of the cost factors into next year, if you could kind of run a little laundry list in terms of pension corporate expense, any temporary cost cuts coming back? 
Frank Hermance :  Let me give you a flavor of this. In essence we are saying the organic growth is going to be somewhat minimal in the full year. Basically if you look at the cost improvements that we are looking at in our budget they total about $75 million. About roughly $45 million of that is the impact of the restructuring charges that we had previously outlined and done in 2009 that are essentially carryover to 2010. The pension impact is about $10 million.  In terms of add back, there is sort of on the other side of the ledger we are going to see some improvement from the fact the FTI and LTI compensation levels were in essence much lower in 2009 than they will be in 2010. But you also have inflationary impacts that are in here and some of the added investments that I talked about where we are going to make additional investments in China, India, etc. So that should give you a rough feel as to the kind of numbers we are looking at and we are going to focus on that $75 million of cost reductions. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville – KeyBanc. 
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: You mentioned two deals sort of got tabled in the fourth quarter. Was there any cost that kind of flowed through the P&L that is meaningful to talk about related to those deals not getting done? 
John Molinelli :  There is probably a little less than a cent a share working through the fourth quarter. 
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: I guess I just want to make sure I understand this. When I go back and look historically the first quarter for AMETEK is typically higher than what you have in Q4 and again understanding that you probably want to be conservative with your guidance, you are looking for something relatively flat. I guess I am trying to get a feel for the backlog you are building, the orders that aren’t going to ship near term, how does that duration of backlog look and should we expect further backlog build in Q1 based on where your order intake level is currently? 
Frank Hermance :  Yes, I would say that is the case. We would expect that in essence we would see higher backlog build in the first quarter. Remember my comments before where we were taking backlog down in our longer cycle businesses. So what is happening is that backlog is being restored in those businesses so you will see shipments out of that beginning in the second quarter and going through the rest of the year.  With respect to your comment on volume, my comments before were really focused on EPS. What tends to happen and it is pretty much our historical pattern is that tax rate goes up in the first quarter as we are anticipating in 2010 and therefore if you look at our EPS on a historical basis it is typically lower in the first quarter. 
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc: I apologize if you talked about it and I missed it but what was your average price realization in 2009 versus 2008 and then what are you expecting for 2010 in terms of pricing? 
Frank Hermance :  In terms of 2009 with respect to 2008 the effective pricing was up about 1%. We are shooting for the same number in 2010. What we have actually budgeted is flat. So we are shooting for a point and we are budgeting flat. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Could you just talk for a second or two about the gross margin, not only in this quarter but for all of 2009. It is lower. Is that a function of volumes and mix? How much does mix play into the gross margin and how should we think about that as we move into 2010? 
Frank Hermance :  That is a good question. We are going to probably have to get you an answer offline to the detail but in general your observation is correct that this is an impact of the volume and the mix of what is occurring. Again it is flavored by those longer cycle businesses which we expect are going to pick up in the second half of next year and that position is more strongly felt right now given the strong order performance in the fourth quarter. That is definitely what you are seeing. I don’t have a quantification of it here. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: But the backlogs maybe given the shipping cycle and the order book to ship cycle seems to favor maybe the backlog seems to favor the higher margin businesses? Process and maybe aerospace? 
Frank Hermance :  Absolutely. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: In the past you have maybe gotten a little bit granular on maybe what you consider to be your earlier cycle businesses? For instance the specialty metals business. Did those respond any different from the overall order number in the fourth quarter? 
Frank Hermance :  Yes. They were extremely strong. The short-cycle businesses when I look across the company did extremely well. The one you picked, specialty metal in particular had a dynamite quarter. One of the bellwethers I use is our chemical products division. I call it our double derivative business because when the economy comes back we just get usually a really strong pop and that business also had a phenomenal fourth quarter and when I look at one of the process businesses that is shorter cycle, our measurement calibration and technology division, that one also had a very, very strong fourth quarter.  So when you look at this what we are seeing is actually what you would expect in a normal cycle. AMETEK held in longer on the front end of the downturn because of the long cycle businesses when our short cycle businesses were falling off very rapidly and now as the economy improves the short cycle businesses are coming back first and the indications are there that our long cycle businesses would follow. 
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: When you look at the sub-segments within EIG and EMG and you gave the calendar 2010 guidance there, which of those maybe five broad segments would you say maybe poses the greatest revenue risk to that guidance? Is it possible the aerospace business it is still questionable whether it be flat? Which of those businesses would you feel lease comfortable with the guidance on? 
Frank Hermance :  Well it probably is aerospace, the way you have worded your question. Let me give you some rational for our comfort level with aerospace which has dramatically improved over the past 5-6 months. If we look at the sub-segments within aerospace we are basically saying the military business which is about 40% of our overall aerospace business is going to be up mid single digits. The third-party MRO business which is about 25% of our business is going to be up high single digits and that growth is going to counterbalance if you will commercial which is now about 20% of our business and the business of regional jets which is about 10%.  So if I then quantify that risk within those various sub-segments of aerospace, the predominant one we were concerned about was commercial aircraft. Our estimates assume a 15% decline in that 20% of our business which is commercial. If you look at the estimates by Boeing which will come out tomorrow and it will be interesting to see what they say but their previous estimates were flat on aircraft. Airbus has come out and said their shipments are going to be flat.  So in essence they are assuming flat and we are assuming down 15%. The reality may be somewhere in between. We may even be on the conservative side but because we have focused on that sort of sub-element of the risk, we feel pretty good the downside risk on volume is pretty minimal. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Elana Wood – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. 
Elana Wood – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I have some follow-up questions on orders. So EIG orders sequentially up low double digits. EMG up 30%. How would that compare to more historical patterns? The sequential build fourth quarter versus third quarter. 
Frank Hermance :  Substantially more. Substantially more. We normally see a little bit of improvement from Q3 to Q4 in our cost driven motor business mainly because many of our operations are in Europe. But that is not the predominate driver here. This was a broad based change I would say. John do you have another point? 
John Molinelli :  I would make the point that in addition to what Frank said that in the fourth quarter the month of December was the strongest month which is unusual for us. We tend to really go into December wondering what is going to happen because of the obvious impact of vacations and holidays. We didn’t see any of that this quarter. December was a very strong month for us and we were very pleasantly surprised with that and it was across the board as Frank said. 
Elana Wood – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Your guidance, are you assuming any currency translation benefit in 2010? 
Frank Hermance :  Very minimal. It is about 1%. 
John Molinelli :  On the top line. Nothing on the bottom line. 
Elana Wood – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I was just looking at corporate expense in the fourth quarter down sequentially by about $1 million. I am wondering what that was attributable to? 
Frank Hermance :  That is the continuation of our cost reduction activities. We had said we would get more cost reductions sequentially in the fourth quarter than in the third and in fact that was part of it but we also saw some in our other operations as well. 
Elana Wood – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: RD&E, how much of an increase are you budgeting for 2010? 
Frank Hermance :  The budget right now for RD&E is $109 million and this year we are expecting to spend about $101 million so that is an $8 million change. Hopefully if the year improves as we go along we would probably even increase that further. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo. 
Allison Poliniak - Wells Fargo: A quick question on the oil and gas market. I know you are pretty broad based there and you talk about it stabilizing. Are there any areas within that market that you still have some concerns about? 
Frank Hermance :  There is still some concern predominately in the US. If you look at this business about 65% of it is outside the United States. That business did not go down as much during the economic malaise and also is really showing signs of improvement right now where in essence a lot of the longer contracts that are needed outside the United States which were shifted way to the right are now coming back into play so I feel some energy, if you will, in that international part of the business.  So the US is the part that is feeling better but there is still some risk. No question there is still some risk. Although the price of oil has clearly stabilized in that mid-$70 a barrel level the price of US natural gas, although higher than what it was in the summer months is still substantially lower than what it was a year ago. So if there is any risk it would be in that part of the business. Again, we think we have balanced that. The international side we think can offset any of that risk. 
Operator:  It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Burke I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.

Frank Hermance: Thank you, Bill. AMETEK delivered good financial results for the third quarter, given the difficult conditions in our markets. Sales were down 23% to $497.1 million. Internal growth was a negative 26%, with the impact of foreign currency and additional 1% headwind. Acquisitions added 4% to growth. Operating income, declined to $77.5 million, from $120.1 million last year, reflecting the impact of the reduced sales, partially counterbalanced by our cost reduction activities. Operating income margin, was 15.6% in the quarter, net income was $43 million or $0.40 per diluted share. These results include $0.02 per diluted share of restructuring costs, predominantly in the Electronic Instruments Group. Excluding these restructuring costs third quarter earnings were $0.42 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations was excellent at $72 million, up 15% over last year's third quarter. In the face of difficult market conditions, we delivered good financial results. We believe our overall business has stabilized, our restructuring initiatives are on track, and we continue to focus on our key strategic priorities to drive value for our shareholders. In the third quarter, we saw the opportunity to do some additional restructuring, predominantly in the Electronic Instruments Group. These actions will have little impact in 2009, but should provide a benefit of approximately $4 million in 2010. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups, Electronic Instruments Group experienced difficult market conditions in the quarter, but our team performed very well. Sales decreased 24% to $271.8 million, as we saw weakness in the aerospace aftermarket process and industrial businesses. Internal growth was down 25%, with the impact of foreign currency an additional 1% headwind. Acquisitions added 2% to revenue. EIG’s operating income was $47.9 million versus $80.2 million in last year's third quarter. Operating margins were 17.6%, reflecting the impact of lower revenues and costs associated with our restructuring actions. Electromechanical Group had a solid third quarter given the continued impact of the economic downturn on their markets. Revenues were down 22%, with weakness in both the cost driven and differentiated businesses. Internal growth was down 26% with the impact of foreign currency an additional 2% headwind acquisitions added 6% to revenue. Operating income for the quarter was down 24% to $38.2 million, operating margins were 17%, as very effective cost reductions and operational excellence initiatives were able to mitigate the impact of the lower sales volume. Operational excellence is the corner stone strategy for the company, and our focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. We are realizing the benefits of the restructuring plan we announced in January, as well as the follow-on plan announced in April. As part of these plans headcounts have been reduced by approximately 2,000 people, since the beginning of the year, and more than 2700 people since June of 2008. In addition to the restructuring activities we continue to drive lower cost through our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives. We are on track to generate more than $20 million in incremental savings this year from these activities. In the third quarter, we realized $6 million of savings and year-to-date we generated $16 million of savings from these initiatives. Overall, the total impact of the operational excellence actions outlined above will be approximately $135 million in reduced costs for 2009. In the first nine months, we recognized approximately $90 million of these savings as anticipated. We continue to invest in global and market expansion and new product development. These initiatives will help our performance during the downturn and position us to out perform during the upturn. Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK's growth over the business cycle. In this third quarter international sales represented 49% of our total sales. AMETEK Commercial Enterprise Shanghai or ACES was opened in 2008 to enable AMETEK to provide service and repair in China as well as to promote the sales of our instrument businesses in that region. Prior to the opening of ACES service was provided by third parties. This new capability is expanding our sales in the region and establishing a stronger linkage with our customers. This strategy has been a tremendous success with bookings exceeding plan by 30% to 50% for a number of divisions. High brightness LEDs are rapidly gaining acceptance in such applications as mobile appliances, LCD displays and general lighting, given the greater efficiency and economic pay back as compared to traditional lighting sources. The manufacturing process for these LEDs is complex and requires precision power systems such as the SG series or DC power supplies from our programmable power division. In the third quarter, programmable power booked over $2 million dollars in orders for these power supplies from a leading manufacturer of LED sonic conductor manufacturing tools. New product development is key to our long-term health and growth. We have consistently invested in RD&E. This year the total is expected to be approximately $103 million down slightly from last year but higher as a percentage of sales. While no single product is significant to AMETEK as a whole we are excited about some recent introductions. NanoSIMS instrumentation from our CAMECA business unit is playing an increasingly important role in life sciences research. SIMS or Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy enables researchers to evaluate cellular material at the nano-metric level. Leading centers of research and processing these instruments which can cost up to $4 million each, including one by the Technical University of Munich in the third quarter. Our process instrument business booked orders for (Inaudible) Process Mass spectrometers from solar power, a manufacturer of thin film photovoltaic cells and modules for power generation. Our process makes spectrometers measure the physical parameters of the manufacturing process to detect contaminants. From a overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 20% of sales up from 18% last year reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. The pipeline of acquisition candidates has definitely picked up. At the end of the third quarter, we announced that we have acquired Unispec Marketing and Thelsha Technical Services, two privately owned and affiliated businesses, headquartered in Mumbai India. These acquisitions provide us with an established sales distribution in service network with a total of 11 offices across India serving the quality control, and the analytical instruments market. Unispec Marketing currently represents our spectral analytical instruments business in India, while its Thelsa Technical Services affiliate provides an installation and wholesale service for those instruments. This acquisition provides AMETEK an immediate sales distribution and service infrastructure in India, that otherwise would have taken years to build. We plan to leverage this distribution structure across other AMETEK business units to increase sales to this very important market. We have the financial and managerial capacity to continue to do acquisitions. Our balance sheet is strong and our cash flow and financing facilities provide us with ample liquidity to pursue this strategy. We continue to look to add differentiated businesses to AMETEK and remain a very disciplined yet aggressive acquirer. Turning to the outlook for the balance of 2009, 2009 continued to be a very challenging year, but we believe that our overall business has stabilized. For the full year, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens on a percentage basis, with core growth down approximately 20% for the company as a whole and in each of the operating groups. We have narrowed our earnings estimates to be approximately $1.87 to $1.92 per diluted share for 2009 excluding the restructuring cost of $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter; our guidance is $1.89 to $1.94 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of 2009, sales are expected to be down in the high teens on a percentage basis from last year's fourth quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.44 to $0.49 per diluted share, a sizable improvement over the third quarter of this year. As anticipated, our fourth quarter should have sequential improvement on better sales and our process and cost driven motor businesses, together with higher benefits from our cost reduction activities. In summary, our overall business has stabilized. We delivered good results for the third quarter in the face of difficult market conditions, our restructuring initiatives are on track and we continue to focus on our key strategic priorities to drive value for our share holders. We have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow that provides us with plenty of liquidity to operate the business and pursue our acquisition strategy. The pipeline of acquisition candidates is very good and we are actively working to bring deals to closure. In addition to acquisitions, we will continue to make sizable investments in new product development as well as global and market expansion to position ourselves for growth. John will now cover some of the financial details and then we will be glad to answer your questions.
John Molinelli: Thank you, Frank. As Frank has covered our results at a high level I will focus on some particular areas of interest. Selling expenses on a core basis were down 22% in the third quarter, in line with the drop in sales. Corporate G&A is running at 1.6% of sales year-to-date, and should be down 30% in dollars from the 2008 levels. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6%, down from last year's third quarter rate of 31.1%, driven primarily by state tax planning initiatives that benefited the quarter. For the first nine months of 2009, the effective tax rate was 31%. As we have said before, actual quarterly rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, capital spending was $6 million for the quarter and $21 million for the first nine months of the year. Expenditures for capital in 2009 are expected to be approximately $30 million. Depreciation and amortization was $17 million in the quarter and $48 million for the first nine months. For 2009, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $66 million. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was excellent, totaling $72 million, up 15% over last year's third quarter as working capital investments were reduced. Reduced operating working capital defined as accounts receivable inventory and less payables, these were a source of cash of $16 million in the quarter driven by reductions in inventory and receivables. Further reductions in working capital remained an opportunity for us. Third quarter free cash flow was $66 million, representing 153% of net income. For the first nine months of 2009, operating cash flow was $256 million, up 25% over the first nine months of 2008. And the free cash flow was 153% of net income. Total debt was $1.06 billion at September 30, unchanged from June 30. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $201 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at quarter end of 37%, as compared with 44% at year end. Over the past two years we have expended a significant amount of effort to improve company's capital structure and ensure that adequate liquidity was available to support our growth plans. A result of this work is that AMETEK has plenty of liquidity available and no significant debt maturities until 2012. At quarter end, we have approximately $635 million of cash and credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. Clearly, liquidity is not an issue at AMETEK. As we see our business stabilize we continue to manage our cost structure and balance sheet effectively maintaining a strong liquidity profile and position ourselves to navigate through the current economic downturn. Bill?
Bill Burke: That concludes our prepared remarks, Laura we will be happy to take questions now.
Operator: The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak: Just a question on the EIG operating margins you talked about a lot of it being impacted by the restructuring, can you quantify that, what the margin would have been maybe without the restructuring cost.
Frank Hermance: The impact of the restructuring on EIG margins was about 100 basis points.
Allison Poliniak: Okay. And then looking at you know you talked about the $135 million in savings this year, can you talk about how much of that is permanent versus how much would eventually come back with volume as well.
Frank Hermance: I would say about two thirds is permanent, and a third might come back.
Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer Funds.
Christopher Glynn: Looking at the fourth quarter, you didn't mention the military, just wondering is that still on track with sort of a concentration of contract work and also in the fourth quarter, any comments on mix trends versus third quarter, and prospects for extended customer shut downs?
Frank Hermance: In terms of the military shipments, as I mentioned in the third quarter conference call, we anticipated more military shipments or will anticipate more military shipments in the fourth quarter and in fact, that is true. We expect that to in fact happen. In terms of mix trends, the only negative impact to mix is that our aerospace aftermarket business, not the third party MRO business but the aerospace aftermarket business our OEM aftermarket business is expected to be a little bit weaker than we had anticipated. And that does have a higher contribution in terms of margin. So there will be a little impact of that but we have covered that in our estimates. And yes, we are concerned that in the fourth quarter, there may be more shut downs right at the end of the year, and is one reason that we have been somewhat conservative in our guidance, but we think we have covered that.
Christopher Glynn: And then just broadly looking at guidance, you'll characterize it as a substantial improvement over the third quarter, certainly see that at the high end but if you look at the low end, up $0.02 versus the adjusted number, this quarter could you just maybe address that and the sensitivity between the high and low ends?
Frank Hermance: Yeah. The way we were looking at that is again on a GAAP basis we did about $0.40 in the third quarter and our guidance is $0.44 to $0.49. So if you look at the midpoint of that range and we feel it is a sizable improvement, and that's why I characterized it that way. In terms of what could cause us to go to say the lower end of that range it would be what I talked about before, if the aerospace aftermarket business is weaker, due to the high contribution margin that would be on the lower end of the range but again, I think we have been relatively conservative on that particular item. So, hopefully that will not occur. In terms of the high end, it would clearly be volume driven as well as maybe getting a little more out of cost reduction activities.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Jim Lucas: John first housekeeping question, payables?
John Molinelli: Sure Jim $171 million at the quarter.
Jim Lucas: Great. Thanks. And frank, on the stabilization comments you made, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit what you are seeing geographically, North America versus Europe and Asia, and you gave a little bit of color on aerospace but in the process and analytical, particularly the process side, any update there of what you are seeing sequentially would be appreciated.
Frank Hermance: Sure, Jim. In terms of the geographical mix of our businesses, I think we are seeing trends that are very similar to what other companies are seeing. In essence, the most positive part of the geographic content is in the far east and particular in China, that particular area of the world has recovered almost unbelievably faster than would have been expected, and we are definitely part of that recovery. So that market is doing well for us. The US market probably the best way I can characterize it is that it has stabilized and that will link to my comments in a moment about process and answer to your second question. And Europe, and that part of the world is the weakest area, but we are seeing a little bit of life over there. So, if I had to rank these Asia first, US second, Europe third. In terms of the process businesses, we are seeing an improving trend in the third quarter conference call. I had talked about the fact that we expected the third quarter to be our weakest quarter of the year. And a key factor in that was the process businesses, because we were seeing a decline in the oil and gas businesses as we entered the third quarter. And in fact that happened. As we go into the fourth quarter, the trend is definitely improving. The oil and gas business has stabilized and the other parts of the business, which are a sizable portion of our process segment which relate to research related businesses which are about 20% of the overall process segment. And our metals related analytic instruments business which is about 25% of the total process segment, are both improving. This is what we anticipated, the order patterns support that and we believe we are going to see increased sales in the fourth quarter over the third quarter from those businesses.
Jim Lucas: Okay. And finally just on the acquisition pipeline, which you know we are hearing from a lot of the companies as the environment is improving, as you look at the pipeline to the extent you can could you give us color of the type of deal that you are seeing, are there particular geographies, smaller versus larger, valuations and what the competitive environment on some of these deals look like?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, sure Jim. Basically, the deals we are looking at are sort of right now on the center of the type of acquisitions that AMETEK does. These are, basically acquisitions that are in the $50 million to $75 million kind of sales range, not real large. These are the type of deals we like to do. Multiples are still a little bit higher than I would like, they have definitely regressed, but not as much as we would have expected given the severity of this economic downturn, hopefully we’ll see those multiples come down a little bit more over the next quarter or two, but the multiples are not crazy. They're definitely within the range of what we have been paying historically, but not as low as I would have, I would have hoped for. In terms of international content versus US content, the majority of the deals we have on the table are US centric. As you know, we have done a lot of international deals over the last several years, but right now the deals that are, we're actively engaged with are US based. In terms of the business, it’s the deals we are looking at are again aerospace, [they're] in our process businesses. So, right in the center of our strategy.
Jim Lucas: Okay. Great. Thank you for the color.
Frank Hermance: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Baliotti with FTN Equity Capital Markets.
John Baliotti: Good morning, Frank. I was curious if just on one housekeeping how is the order, if you look at the sub segments, is there a way to characterize or just rank the order patterns that you are seeing?
Frank Hermance: Let me think about that. We don’t view it that way, but the total orders for the quarter were $479 million. And if I look at the trends process is up, cost driven motors would be up. Aerospace would be relatively flat, maybe slight decline due to the aftermarket. So if I rank them, I would put the process and cost driven at the top, I put aerospace second, and I would probably rank the other business which is the industrial businesses and EIG at about sort of flattish to same as aerospace.
John Baliotti: Okay. And if you sort of in a longer term view, if you think about what you guys have done since the last cycle, in terms of the M&A and both on acquisitions and also adjustments you have made to the efficiency of the company, is there a way, do you guys think about where you have moved the company in term of the long term growth rate of the company the core growth and also the profitability like as you do deals and think about how the portfolio shifted, is there a way for you to think about in the big picture how do you think the growth has changed?
Frank Hermance: Yeah I think I can give you an outline on without maybe specifics. But just to give you a view of the trends, first of all, we have done a sizable amount of restructuring. If you look at it on the basis of the kind of numbers that we are talking about in terms of cost reductions, say as a percentage of sales versus other companies we are clearly at the high end, in term of restructuring. And that means that as volume returns, the contribution margin of the company is going to be superlative. Our contribution margins had run when volume was going up on the order of say low 30s, and we are in the process now putting our budgets together for next year. But obviously, the contribution margin is going be substantially higher than that. So, for every dollar to the top line, what goes to the bottom line is going to be significant. And I can't wait for that to happen in terms of seeing that volume increase, but the fact that we have stabilized now hopefully we are not too far away from seeing some major up ticks in our markets. In term of the structure of the company, it really depends on the timeframe in which I look at it. But in general as I think you know, when I became CEO of the company the majority of our business was in cost driven businesses and we have made a fundamental shift to much more differentiated businesses, and that continued, through the last round of acquisitions so that we have moved the entire portfolio of AMETEK to much more differentiated businesses, the last number I saw had our businesses, over 90% are differentiated type of businesses. So, a very very significant change in the portfolio and as that change happens the internal growth of the company goes up. Just by definition having less of the cost driven businesses in terms of the percentage of your total revenue meaning [that] that’s a lower growth business means the overall growth of the company is going to going to go up. So, I think as the economy improves we are going to see an improved organic growth rate, there will be some negative impact of potentially in term of margins as you bring in new acquisitions, because you obviously don't bring them at the contribution level, but we have always been able to overcome that and show good margin improvement. And I think that will happen as well as we go into the future. John I think you have a point too.
John Molinelli: Yeah, I would chip in Frank, the picture you are painting we anticipated our capital expenditures to be reduced, and we are seeing that clearly this year with conservative estimates of only $30 million in capital spend this year. And I think that bodes well for the future needs of the company, because we are not trying to manage that number at all. I think that's just a natural flow from the way we have constructed the business pattern.
John Baliotti: And John would you think that as you guys expect your own spending behavior coming out of this and your customers, are you expecting more, what sort of pace are you expecting for your I would imagine that you are going to react similar to your customers in terms of your own, you know your CapEx and other types of spending. Do you think its more of a gradual.
John Molinelli: It’ll be very gradual, John. We have got plenty of prick bricks and [mortars] around the world. I don't see those needs hitting us at all. We’ll have incremental capital needs basically a project-by-project basis. And so I think the trend of this year of 30 million, that might be people are so busy saving money that they're not spending there. But slightly but I just don't see capital needs being a major part of our dynamic going forward.
Frank Hermance: And just to add to that, I mean that also reflects this change in portfolio that we have gone through and that I can remember a number of years ago when we were looking at 5% and 6% of sales in terms of capital (Inaudible) of the business. And as we changed the portfolio, the capital appetite for these businesses are substantially less.
John Baliotti: So its not just the current environment but structurally going forward…
Frank Hermance: Structurally
John Baliotti: That will stay, and okay. All right thanks very much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets.
Jamie Sullivan: Hi, good morning. Wondering if you can just clarify on the end market views and your different businesses if the aerospace aftermarket is that the only real change that you have seen since 3Q?
Frank Hermance: Well, it’s not the only change we have seen from the view point. As I mentioned in answering Jim's question our process businesses are also going to improve. Now we did talk about that in the third quarter. So I guess it’s how you characterize that. But yeah I would say that the only change from what we talked about in Q3 is a little bit weaker business in the aerospace aftermarket.
Jamie Sullivan: Okay. And you still see aerospace overall as flattish as we go into next year.
Frank Hermance: Yes. That's a great question. If you look at our overall aerospace business that encompasses both half’s of the company the outlook for next year obviously we are putting our budgets together right now. And we’ll get a much better call on that, as we go through the process. But our outlook right now is that basically our military business which is about 40% of our sales. And our third party MRO business which is about 25% of our sales will have positive growth, and we'll have negative growth in the commercial business, which is about 20% of our sales and our business and regional aircraft business which is about 15% of our sales and they will roughly counterbalance one another say within plus or minus 5%.
Jamie Sullivan: And on the oil and gas side, you mentioned orders improving into 4Q. Last quarter you also talked about the tone of customers getting somewhat incrementally positive, can you just give us an update there, kind of as we start to think about 2010 with the tone of customers and their budgets look like?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, it’s definitely little bit better. I don't want to say it’s off the charts positive. That would be definitely an overstatement. But we are hearing a little bit better trends, there is a lot of controversy as to why the price of oil is at 80. But that sure can hurt, having the price of oil little bit higher. So we do expect some improvement as we go into the fourth quarter as I shouldn't say improvement, but sort of in that business more of a flattish kind of environment, but people are more positive about that segment is probably the best way to say it.
Jamie Sullivan: Okay. Then just lastly, I guess as was thinking about M&A and the portfolio of businesses that you have, if you think about short, mid and long cycle do you think about that when you think about putting together the portfolio although waiting at a little bit more towards short, mid or long or is that not really something you consider?
Frank Hermance: Well it’s absolutely something we consider. Just in general and this is obviously just a high level comment the very short cycle businesses that meet with our portfolio tend to have a more of a commoditization tone to the businesses. So that in general because we want to acquire differentiated businesses with a higher technological content, they tend to be more medium and longer cycle business, they tend to be more in the process side of the business, more in the aerospace side where the process businesses are, I characterize them as mid cycle and the aerospace more long cycle. So there is a tendency for the portfolio to move in that direction. And you know I think you can see that as the economy here dip so the impact to us was delayed because of that and the recovery is probably a little bit delayed from what you have heard from other companies. So its part of the make up of AMETEK right now.
Jamie Sullivan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.
Mark Douglass: Hi. Good morning. If we can talk about EIG again and the restructuring is there anything in particular that precipitated the additional restructuring here part of process and analytical or can you just give a little more indication as to what precipitated that?
Frank Hermance: Sure. It was purely opportunity based, as we looked at EIG, we saw an opportunity that came out of some of our thoughts about next year as we are going into the budgeting process. And we felt it was in the best interest of everyone to basically make that change, it was not huge obviously, it was quite small in comparison with the major restructuring that we did. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks the charge was only a couple of pennies and we expect about $4 million of savings next year from that activity. So we just, the real answer to your question is it was an opportunity.
Mark Douglass: And that $4 million is on top of can you go through what you expect in 2010?
Frank Hermance: We are in a process now of obviously rolling all of those cost reductions up. But yes, this is clearly incremental to anything else that we have talked to you about.
Mark Douglass: Okay. So, right now I forget what you said in the past. But we can go back and see what you are expecting 2010?
Frank Hermance: Sorry I don't have that number in front of me right now.
Mark Douglass: Think it was maybe 190 in total. Okay.
Frank Hermance: Okay.
Mark Douglass: And then if we again look at the analytical side of EIG what do you see as the opportunity going forward there? Is it a lot of new products, new developments and say mass spectrometers or is there, are you expecting some stimulus impact, people just increasing CapEx budgets because they want more quality control. Can you go a little more into of what you are seeing in analytical?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, absolutely. There are certain [problems] to what we are going to be seeing in analytical. Definitely, this is an area where we have put sizable dollars into development of new products. So, that this is a key driver and I talked about a couple of those in my opening remarks. So, we are looking to bring out new instruments at the higher end of those portfolios that have excellent margins and good growth characteristics. Another very important part of the analytic instruments strategy is the continual globalization of that platform. And the fellow that runs this business, Dave Zapico has done a great job of in essence getting his fair share of the international market. The India acquisition that I talked about in my opening remarks and also the fact that earlier this year, we talked about the fact that we are opening our own office in Bangalore, basically we are going to use that as a center of our operations in India. We are going to do both distribution from that office manage the distribution links as well as we are going to put R&D capability in there and use it as a low cost research and development facility. And in essence, we have just hired actually an R&D manager for that facility. And now we are going to hire engineers into that operation. And with the acquisition that I talked about, we now have offices throughout India. So we are going to really go after this and our analytic businesses are the ones that are driving that they see substantial opportunity in India its one of the last areas in the world that we have not put as much energy in, we put a lot of energy in China and the far East a lot of energy in Europe and both Western Europe and Eastern Europe and the Middle East. And now, India is a great opportunity for us. In terms of stimulus, absolutely part of the research improvement that I talked to and answered to a previous question, is stimulus driven. It’s not totally stimulus driven, but partially stimulus driven because funds are going to the various universities and research organizations around the world and we can capitalize on that.
Mark Douglass: Okay. And then finally again going back to the acquisitions. If when you close some deals, what are we looking at as far as accretion possibilities, is there going to be when the types of deals you are looking at do you think there is going to be significant amount of amortization that's going to hit in the first year and two up accretion possibilities or can you just describe a little bit about what you might expect there?
Frank Hermance: I mean as you know we do essentially all of our deals with debt, the cost of debt right now is very minimal. So in essence any deal that we do will have accretion associated with it. So again we are not looking at the mega deal here. We are looking at [Bolton’s] and those types of deals but, yes we would clearly expect accretion from the deals that we close, we don't expect sizable amortization there’ll be some but they won't be sizable. And one negative to what I am saying is that with some of the accounting rule changes you do have to expense more of the restructuring costs of these deals. So that will detract, but I can tell you the deals we are looking at will still be nicely accretive.
Mark Douglass: In the first year?
Frank Hermance: In the first year.
Mark Douglass: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Elana Wood with Merrill Lynch.
Elana Wood: Good morning. Would you mind just running through the organic growth by platform or by end market like you usually do?
Frank Hermance: Okay.
Elana Wood: Or maybe just comment where there are changes perhaps versus the second quarter if that's easier?
Frank Hermance: Yeah. Probably the easiest way I can do it is just quickly run through the businesses. For process, in the third quarter, the organic growth was down about 25% and for the full year we expect it to be down about 20%. For aerospace, its basically approximately 10% down for both the quarter and the year. For power industrial, let me see. I have got to get that out of my data here. Its around 25% down for both. For the differentiated part of EMG its down about 20. And for our cost driven for the year, it will be down about 25. So those are the numbers and as I mentioned in my opening talk, we expect the groups for the year and the company to be down about 20. So 20 for the company, 20 for EIG, 20 for EMG.
Elana Wood: Okay terrific. Question on the tax rate, so you talked about some state tax planning helping the third quarter. Is there any benefit in the fourth quarter? Or how should we [briefing] about the tax rate for the fourth quarter?
John Molinelli: The tax rate that you see year-to-date would be about the level we will end up for the final for the year. Approximately, don't see much changing in the fourth quarter at all. This was more of a one-time event from a benefit standpoint.
Elana Wood: Okay. And then did you buy back any stock this quarter? It looks like your share count is a little bit lower?
John Molinelli: No, no.
Elana Wood: No? Okay. Currency, just wondering what you're baking in terms of currency benefit for EPS next quarter it looks to me like translation may boost EPS may be around the order of $0.02 to $0.03 sequentially, assuming the dollar remains roughly where it is today?
John Molinelli: We don't see that in our forecast.
Elana Wood: Okay. So you are not baking in any sort of sequential currency benefit?
John Molinelli: No, we don't see anything at all of that magnitude in our forecast.
Elana Wood: Okay. And then just lastly if you wouldn't mind commenting on order trends in terms since the quarter has closed, so that you have seen in October how that might compare to September's order trends?
Frank Hermance: Yeah. First of all if I talk about Q3 that was definitely a sequential improvement in orders, with September being sizably more than the first two months now. You have to take somewhat into account that the first two months are you know vacation month’s etcetera. But even taking in to that account, we started taking that in to account we definitely saw some improvement in September, and so far in October the trend has continued. John and I were actually just commenting yesterday that orders are started off in October very, very good. The thing that we are concerned about, though is in the fourth quarter, whether we are going to see some plant shut downs of our customers. And so we have been a little bit conservative in our forecast based on that possibility.
Elana Wood: Okay. And then just lastly on the restructuring, I don't know if its been announced yet to your employees, if it has can you just comment on what which businesses are going to be impacted sort of broadly with aerospace or would you prefer not to comment?
Frank Hermance: Yeah I would prefer not to comment. It was in EIG.
Elana Wood: Okay.
Frank Hermance: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville: Most of my questions have actually been answered Frank, I was wondering if you can maybe just provide a little more color on some of the businesses you don't specifically talk about in EMGs, such as the differentiated motor businesses outside of military and aerospace, and what you are seeing in the specialty metals business?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, what we are seeing in the specialty metals business is an improvement trend, Q3 was weak, no question about it. But orders and specialty metals SMP are showing some life and we are feeling better about that business. Our Reading Alloys business still is somewhat weak, and haven't seen the improvement trends there. And our technical motor business which is part of the differentiated segment is flattish, is the best way to describe that it is not yet seen an up tick.
Matt Summerville: And then just a question on pension, John can you remind us what your pension expense is for 2009 and what you think it might be in 2010?
John Molinelli: Yeah. The 2009 is $18 million increased costs this year for the year. And that’s relatively evenly throughout the year. Next year we are hopeful that we’ll get some relief there but it is too soon to make a prediction about what that will turn out to be.
Matt Summerville: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good morning. John or Frank, could you just talk through the gross margin on a consolidated basis a little bit? I mean we lost about 200 basis points there. And I am curious the decremental didn't look too bad. But is that primarily mix, or did any of the restructuring hit that?
Frank Hermance: All of the restructuring that we talked about obviously hit that and the degradation is largely due to the large volume. That's really what drove it. The internal growth and the growth of the business and the third quarter as we said is going to be the weakest. And that was the primary driver. Although we are pretty damn pleased with the absolute level of that given the volume drop to as you said the incremental detrimental margins were good. So we are pretty pleased with it, but that's what drove it, Richard.
Richard Eastman: For instance the aerospace aftermarket, presumably that would be a higher gross margin for mix also…
Frank Hermance: Yeah. I mean that's in that equation when I say the volume went down and obviously that's going to have a disproportionately higher impact on the gross margin. The gross margins in that business run on the order of 70%, 75%. So they're very high.
Richard Eastman: I see. And then also just a question on pricing Frank are we flattish year-over-year on price? Have we had any give backs here, how did pricing look overall?
Frank Hermance: Yeah, it varies by business, Richard. But I would say, overall, we are slightly up about a point. And the pricing environment is not easy. It’s tougher, but if you step back and think about the, what's happened in the economy to be able to get a point of pricing is still relatively good. But the environment is not easy to get pricing. NEW SPEAKER
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just a last question with sales maybe for the fourth quarter, I think given your guidance, maybe around 515ish million and your orders, Q3 orders were 479 is the difference there this improving trend that we have seen or are you comfortable that the military business can spike up off of the backlog? How do we make up the differences?
Frank Hermance: It is a little of both, obviously we are seeing improving trends in the process businesses as I talked about. We are seeing an improving trend in the cost driven businesses. And yes we have backlog to ship not just in the military side of the business, but aerospace overall has good backlog and we also expect those order rates in aerospace to come up, but that stuff will not necessarily be shippable in the fourth quarter.
Richard Eastman: Okay. So you feel pretty good about the visibility on sales for Q4 with the exception of some possible plant shut downs at the very year end.
Frank Hermance: That's exactly right. Very well characterized.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes as a follow up from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn: Thanks. Just going back to aerospace aftermarket, could you talk about your different exposure to the supply chain channel versus the airlines, what you are seeing the relative state of de-stocking in those two sides, and what your thoughts are around when you might come up against the flat comparison in the aftermarket?
Frank Hermance: What we are seeing from the airlines is obviously, they are having financial difficulties right now. So they are trying not to order anything that they don't need. So there's definitely a significant push back from the airlines. And at some point that string will run out, where in essence they have to order. So, if we look at the, I’ll give you just some market data. Overall, the aerospace aftermarket business is expected to be down this year on the order of 20% - 25%, those kind of numbers. But next year there's actually all of the industry forecast that I have looked at show growth going into next year. And we expect that our aftermarket will be better than you are going to see some better performance there, and another very important thing, if I just switch the conversation for a moment to our third party MRO business. There we have a tremendous opportunity to gain share, and in my overall view of aerospace that I mentioned before, we are expecting mid single digit to high single digit organic growth in the third party MRO business because of our ability to gain share.
Christopher Glynn: Sounds good. Thank you again.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Burke, I’d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.

Operator: (Operator Instructions) Welcome to the AMETEK, Inc. Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. For opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Bill Burke: Good morning and welcome to AMETEK’s Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me this morning are Frank Hermance, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Bob Mandos, Senior Vice President and Comptroller. AMETEK's fourth quarter results were released before the market opened today and have been distributed to everyone on our list. These results are also available electronically on your market systems and on our website at www.AMETEK.com/investors. A tape of today's conference call maybe accessed until February 13th by calling 888-203-1112 and entering the confirmation code number 8247526. This conference call is also webcast and can be accessed at AMETEK.com and at StreetEvents.com. This conference call will be archived on both of these websites. I will remind you that any statements made by AMETEK during the call that are not historical in nature are to be considered forward looking statements. As such these statements are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. Those risk factors are contained in our SEC filings. I will also refer you to the investor's section of ametek.com for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures used during this conference call.  We will begin today with some prepared remarks and then we'll take your questions. I will now turn the meeting over to Frank.
Frank Hermance: As Bill mentioned we are joined on the call today by Bob Mandos our Senior Vice President and Comptroller who will be filling in today for John Molinelli. Bob is a 20 year veteran of the company and has been our corporate comptroller for the last 12 years. John Molinelli the company’s Chief Financial Officer, was injured in an accident. He is currently recuperating at home and will be back with us when his recuperation is complete. Turning now to our financial results. Despite difficult economic conditions AMETEK had a very good fourth quarter. Sales were up 7%, $623.7 million on the contributions from acquired businesses offsetting a weakening core growth environment. Internal growth in sales was a -2%, if the effects of foreign currency are included internal growth was a -6%. Operating income excluding a fourth quarter restructuring charge was up 18% and operating income margins expanded 180 basis points. Adjusted earnings were up 15% and diluted earnings per share were up 16%.  As a result of the global economic downturn order rates for our businesses slowed dramatically in November and December. Orders were down 10% for the fourth quarter of this year versus last year’s fourth quarter. As we assess this slowdown and put together our business plans for 2009 it became readily apparent that we needed to realign the company’s cost structure with expected market conditions. In the fourth quarter we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $40 million or $0.25 per diluted share to cover the costs of employee reductions, facility closures and asset write downs. At a group level the charge was evenly split with approximately $20 million recorded in each group. As part of the plan we expect to reduce our headcount by more than 10%, close or significantly reduce 10 manufacturing facilities and reduce other spending throughout the company. While these actions are difficult particularly for the colleagues and communities affected they are necessary to maintain our financial and competitive position. Importantly we do not believe these reductions will harm the long term growth prospects of the company. As an example, research development and engineering expense is planned to increase 3% in 2009. We expect to generate approximately $75 million in annual savings from these cost reduction activities in 2009. The benefits of these restructuring activities will have a greater impact in the second half of the year. The following discussion will exclude the restructuring charge. For a reconciliation to the applicable GAAP numbers please refer to the press release we issued today or to AMETEK’s website.  Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. In the Electronic Instruments Group had a very good fourth quarter. Sales were up 8% to $361.6 million driven by strength in our power and process instrument businesses and the contributions from the acquisition of Vision Research, Xantrex Programmable Power and California Instruments. Core growth was flat in the quarter. If the effects of foreign currency are included internal growth was -2%. EIG’s operating income was up 23% for the quarter. Operating margins improved 300 basis points to 24.8% as compared to 21.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year EIG sales were up 17% to $1.4 billion driven by growth in our aerospace, power and process businesses as well as the contributions from acquisitions. For 2008 EIG operating income was up 26% to $327.1 million. Operating margins improved 160 basis points to 23.3%. The Electromechanical Group had a good fourth quarter considering the economic environment. Revenues were up 6% to $262.1 million from the contributions from the Reading Alloys, Muirhead Aerospace, Drake Air, Motion Control Group and Umeco Repair and Overhaul acquisitions, more than offsetting difficult market conditions for our cost-driven motor business. Core growth in EMG was -6% for the quarter. If the effects of foreign currency are included internal growth was -10%. Operating income for the quarter was up 4% to $44.1 million. Operating margins were 16.8% this year as compared to 17.2% last year. For the full year EMG sales were up 20% to $1.13 billion driven by the contributions from acquisitions and strength in our differentiated businesses. For 2008 EMG operating income was up 16% to $194.6 million. Operating margins were 17.2% as compared with 17.8% in 2007. As many of you are aware we are focused on four growth strategies to drive AMETEK’s growth and profitability: Operational Excellence Global and Market Expansion New Product Development Acquisitions At various points in the business cycle individual strategies will assume a greater or lesser importance in moving the company forward. Today, as in the last economic downturn our operational excellence and acquisition strategies will play the most prominent role in driving the success of AMETEK as we aggressively address the impact of the current economic slowdown. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company and our relentless focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. As the economy weakened during 2008 we were proactively reducing costs. The restructuring actions taken during the fourth quarter indicate our focus on making sure the cost structure is properly aligned with expected market conditions. As well, at each business unit AMETEK colleagues are implementing initiatives to improve plan productivity, reduce costs, and increase capital efficiency. In addition to these business unit level activities there are some company wide initiatives that are driving significant financial benefits. Our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives have been key drivers to increased profitability in 2008 and will be again in 2009. We generated $21 million in incremental savings in 2008 from these activities. For 2009 we expect to realize a similar amount of incremental savings. We are continuing our migration to best cost manufacturing locales. We’re also Mexico, Shanghai and the Czech Republic. The restructuring actions announced today represent a continuation of these activities. Revenues from these plants are expected to total approximately $330 million in 2009. This reflects and increase of $20 million in differentiated products offset by a decline in our cost driven motor business which primarily produces in these facilities. As a result of the very aggressive overall cost reductions we have initiated which include the restructuring activities we are well positioned to handle the weakening economic environment in both 2009 and 2010. The restructuring alone will have over a $100 million positive operating income impact in 2010. Turning to acquisitions, in 2008 we acquired seven companies representing approximately $300 million in annualized revenue. Last week we made our first acquisition f 2009 acquiring High Standard Aviation. These businesses are all differentiated and expand our market positions in analytical instrumentation, aerospace MRO, power, technical motors and engineered materials. In November we announced the acquisition of Muirhead Aerospace Limited, a leading manufacturer of motion technology products and a provider of avionics repair and overhaul services for the aerospace and defense markets. With annual sales of approximately $54 million UK based Muirhead expands AMETEK’s penetration in motion control products for the aerospace and defense markets including actuators and other specialized linear motors complementing our existing technical motor capabilities. As well, Muirhead further expands and strengthens AMETEK’s position as a leading independent provider of MRO services to the European aviation industry. It provides avionics repair services to a wide variety of commercial, business jet and defense customers. Last week we acquired High Standard Aviation, a Miami based provider of after market repair services to the aerospace industry. The privately held High Standard Aviation has annual sales of approximately $31 million. High Standard Aviation strengthens our capabilities in electrical, electromechanical and hydraulic repair and provides us with a valuable presence in Miami, a key MRO hub for the Southeastern United States as well as Latin America. It also adds to our position in the air cargo segment of the MRO business broadening our base with a number of key customers. We continue to look to add differentiated businesses to AMETEK and will remain a very disciplined yet aggressive acquirer. We have the financial and managerial capacity to continue to do acquisitions and believe this will be a great environment as the price for acquisitions recedes. Turning our attention now to the outlook for 2009 we expect 2009 will be a challenging year given the continuing economic downturn. Based on our current understanding of market condition, which has a more than normal level of uncertainty, we anticipate that 2009 revenue will be down slightly from 2008. Contributions from acquisitions will be more than offset by mid single digit negative core growth in each group and currency headwinds.  Consistent with our announcement last week we expect our earnings to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per diluted share. This estimate includes an additional $23 million in pension costs or $0.14 per share. Given the weak order input in the fourth quarter 2008 we expect that we will have a weak first quarter of 2009. Sales are expected to be down slightly from last year’s first quarter. We expect our earnings to be approximately $0.54 to $0.58 per diluted share as compared to last year’s first quarter of $0.62 per diluted share. This estimate includes approximately $0.035 from additional pension costs in 2009. In summary, we’re pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. We grew our top line by 7% in the face of weakening core growth environment we increased operating margins by 180 basis points and diluted earnings per share by 16%. We’ve aggressively realigned our cost structure to deal with the current market expectations.  We expect 2009 will be a very challenging year given the continual global economic downturn though we believe that AMETEK’s strong portfolio of businesses, proven operational capabilities, lower cost structure and a successful focus on strategic acquisitions will enable us to outperform in 2009. We look forward to building on our track record of success and remain confident that our fourth growth strategies will continue to create value for our shareholders. Bob Mandos will now cover some of the financial details and then we’ll be glad to answer your questions.
Bob Mandos: As Frank has covered our results at a high level I will focus on some particular areas of interest. The cash portion of the $40 million restructuring charge is approximately $32 million, primarily related to severance costs. Excluding the restructuring charge selling expenses were up 9% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effect of acquisitions selling expense was down 2%. Corporate G&A was essentially unchanged from last year’s fourth quarter in absolute dollars and fell to 1.8% of sales as compared to 2% of sales in last year’s fourth quarter. After excluding the charge related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock in Q2 G&A spend for the full year 2008 decreased to 1.7% of sales versus 1.9% of sales for 2007. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% slightly higher than last year’s fourth quarter of 31.7%. For the full year the effective tax rate was 32.5% in line with our expectations. We are planning on a similar tax rate of 32.5% for 2009. As we have said before this is a full year rate and actual quarterly rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. Like most other defined benefit pension plans our defined benefit pension plans returns were impacted by the performance of the stock and bond markets last year, reducing their funded status. Just prior to year end we made a contribution of approximately $74 million to our defined benefit plans. With this contribution our US defined benefit plan is 100% funded at year end. Despite this large contribution in 2009 pension costs will be a significant headwind. Total pension costs for AMETEK will increase approximately $23 million or $0.14 per diluted share. These additional costs are included in the earnings guidance that we have given for 2009. On the balance sheet working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables was 21.4% of sales for the year down from last year’s level of 21.5%. We continue to see an opportunity to reduce our working capital investment and plan to reduce this overall percentage in 2009. Capital spending was $13 million for the quarter and $44 million for 2008 or 1.7% of sales. Expenditures for capital in 2009 are expected to be at approximately the same level. Depreciation and amortization was $17 million in the quarter and $63 million for 2008. For 2009 depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $67 million. Our operating cash flow for 2008 was $247 million. Adding back the pension funding of $74 million operating cash flow was approximately $321 million.  Total debt was $1.1 billion at December 31st, down $46 million from September 30th. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $87 million resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at quarter end of 45%, that’s compared with 42% at the end of the third quarter. These ratios reflect the contribution to our defined benefit plans of $74 million in the fourth quarter and $64 million paid for acquisitions. Over the past 18 months we have expended a significant amount of effort to improve the company’s capital structure to ensure that adequate liquidity was available to support our growth plans. The result of this work is that AMETEK has plenty of liquidity available and no significant debt maturities in 2009. At quarter end we had approximately $550 million of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Clearly liquidity is not an issue for AMETEK. In summary, we continue to manage our cost structure and balance sheet effectively, maintaining a strong liquidity profile and positioning ourselves to navigate through the current economic downturn.
Bill Burke: That concludes our prepared remarks. We’d be happy to take questions now.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Accounts payable in the quarter?
Bob Mandos: $204 million.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Switching gears to bigger picture one of the things that really jumped out in the quarter was the performance of EIG notwithstanding the flat core business which speaks to the acquisitions you made. Can you talk about the margin profile of the company given the busy acquisition campaign in 2008?
Frank Hermance: We’re actually very pleased with the margins of the company as I mentioned in the fourth quarter operating income margins was up 180 basis points so very, very strong performance. EIG was obviously the key contributor. In the fourth quarter in particular EIG had some strong mix in the portfolio but more importantly than that the cost improvements that we put in place earlier in the year had a very positive impact on EIG and that was a key factor in driving those margins. Now with the restructuring that we’ve put in place for next year we think our margin performance is going to hang in there pretty good.
Jim Lucas – Janney Montgomery Scott: Taking a look at the longer cycle businesses can you speak to what you’re seeing, how they exited the year. You talked about orders being down 10% but in particular one of the focuses lately at least from a lot of questions from investors is on the process side in particular. It might be helpful to maybe walk us through where exactly the AMETEK exposure is on the process side. Likewise within aerospace if you can comment about the mix and what you’re seeing there particularly in light of Cessna’s news yesterday.
Frank Hermance: Why don’t I walk through both the aerospace part of the business and the process part of the business and give you a flavor for what happened in Q4 and how we see 2009. In aerospace those markets remain healthy yet their not as robust as last year. If you look at the military side of our business which for all of aerospace is roughly half of the business, due to our focus on helicopters coupled with numerous military retrofit and upgrade programs as well as our focus on electronic cooling our military markets remain strong and are expected to be strong in 2009. I noticed this morning in the Wall Street that L-3 and Raytheon are talking about very strong performance in 2009 which was encouraging to me because it supported our feeling that military is going to be good. Different dynamics going on in commercial aircraft versus business and regional jet aircraft. The backlog at Airbus and Boeing remain healthy and commercial OEM shipments in 2009 should be up. As a matter of fact if you look at what’s occurring Airbus is expected to be flat in terms of shipments and Boeing just recently increased their shipments for 2009.  Prior to the time they increased those shipments they were going to be up about 15% because of the strike last year they didn’t ship as many aircraft last year so were going to ship more. Now they’re saying their going to be up about 28% in shipments. That bodes quite well for our commercial aircraft business. Your specific question around business jets there’s no question that business and regional jets are going to be down. The numbers are expected to be 10% to 15%, if you include the Textron recent announcement. We’re very fortunate in that particular area that we have excellent content on the new Embraer and Cessna aircraft which should allow us to outperform the market. One other point is that the third party MRO business we expect to actually be up double digits based on the large wins at Delta and American Airlines which we recently consummated and also the benefit of the ramp up of our service center in Singapore. When you look at that whole picture the order intake was down, it was not good in the fourth quarter, business just kind of stopped for everything in November and December. The backlogs here are strong and we’re thinking and feeling pretty good that we’re going to show probably mid single digit growth in aerospace for 2009. Switching to the process businesses there’s no question that our process businesses are beginning to weaken. If you look at overall market expectations for instrumentation, for oil and gas, including upstream, midstream and downstream the market itself is expected to be down 5% to 10% for instrumentation. If you look at the broader analytic instruments market we expect similar negative growth rates. We started the see that in the fourth quarter where our internal growth was essentially flat. What we’re budgeting next year and what’s included in our estimates is a negative mid single digit organic growth. A quick summary, aerospace still looks pretty good, not quite as robust as last year. Process businesses beginning to weaken and we believe we’ve covered that in our estimates.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer
Christopher Glynn – Oppenheimer: I want to parse out some of the pieces of the restructuring cost savings; I think you had $14 million from the 3Q actions, $21 million from sourcing again and $75 million from the new actions. I want to clarify if the sourcing is it all a subset of the $75 million, proportionally by segment where the savings is?
Frank Hermance: In terms of the first part of your question with the $21 million of savings only a little bit of that is included in the actual restructuring so most of that is outside of the restructuring itself. In terms of if you look at the full restructuring the $75 million of cost benefit in 2009 in excess of $100 million in 2010 the breakdown of that in terms of savings is roughly two thirds in EIG and one third in EMG. A further breakdown that might be helpful to you, if you look at that savings in the year 2009 rough numbers $25 million is in the first half of the year and about $50 million is in the second half of the year, obviously increasing throughout the year with the exit run rate being above that $100 million annualized rate.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Baliotti – FTN Midwest Securities
John Baliotti – FTN Midwest Securities: Looking at aerospace, I don’t know if it’s enough of an offset but would you expect a dynamic shift between the MRO after market versus new build if people are keeping the aircraft they have longer. Does that manifest itself in more after market or does that take too long to show up.
Frank Hermance: That takes a while to show up. If you look at the dynamics right now in the MRO business on a worldwide basis the US is obviously weakening, but when you look at it on an international basis its still quite good. As I mentioned in my opening remarks we’ve had major wins with two airlines. We’re actually pretty bullish on the MRO business overall and also our Singapore repair facility which is now up and running, it’s been approved by the FAA. We see great growth opportunities there. We actually feel that the third party MRO will be one of our strongest segments in aerospace this year.
John Baliotti – FTN Midwest Securities: You can benefit by some comps where there are opportunities you just didn’t underlying have last year.
Frank Hermance: That’s exactly right. There’s a difference between the market and how we’re going to perform.
John Baliotti – FTN Midwest Securities: In this market, last year, this year and maybe next year thinking long term is there any kind of shift in thinking between research and development versus M&A or do those two strategies just run on their own course?
Frank Hermance: They’re going to run on their own course but as we did in the last economic downturn our management focus is going to shift more towards operational excellence and acquisitions. We think the environment for acquisitions is going to become increasingly attractive. That’s one of the reasons that we got the extra cash last year. As those prices come down and with the talent we’ve now put in place where we substantially increased the M&A side of the business we’re going to really focus on that. That’s not to the detriment of RD&E. As I mentioned in my opening remarks we’re going to spend actually more money on RD&E in 2009 then 2008 and we’ve got those systems pretty well in place and that’s going to flow so there’s not going to be a retrenchment there’s just going to be increased focus on the M&A side of the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ned Borland – Next Generation Equity Research
Ned Borland – Next Generation Equity Research: Following up on the last question on acquisitions, what are your acquired revenue goals for 2009?
Frank Hermance: As we’ve always said we focus in that $100 to $150 million region. Obviously we had a great year last year with over $300 million in acquired revenue. Its not like there’s a specific, if we make ‘x’ we’re going to feel good and if we make ‘y’ we’re not. Its more are there good companies available, do they meet our strategic thrust, is the pricing right and we’ve got plenty of cash where we could do more than $300 million if the right opportunities came up. It’s very difficult for me to give you a number and say that’s what we’re going to do because I just don’t know.
Ned Borland – Next Generation Equity Research: The environment hasn’t shifted enough that it wouldn’t be inconceivable to match last year’s total?
Frank Hermance: No, not at all. The environment slowed a little in the fourth quarter which you can imagine. It seemed like the whole world slowed in the fourth quarter. It definitely has come back now after the first of the year. We’ve got lots of activity, lots of possibilities. We’ve already closed one as you know. We’re going to be aggressive. That doesn’t mean we’re going to get $300 million it means we’re going to be aggressive and do the right things.
Ned Borland – Next Generation Equity Research: On raw material tailwinds what do you have baked into your forecast for that if any?
Frank Hermance: As I think you know, in terms of commodities, as commodity prices went up we didn’t have any major problem on the P&L. Similarly as commodities go down we have it balanced and we essentially passed that on through the way we price etc. There also isn’t going to be any major positive that comes out of this. There will be some where we have fixed price contracts but its not going to be significant in the positive direction as it was in the negative direction as commodities were going the other way. Overall in terms of inflation we’ve put in roughly $0.21 of cost increase just due to general inflation; wages, materials, everything.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Eastman – Robert Baird
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: I wanted to double check, what’s your currency forecast for ’09 at this point given the current level of the dollar?
Frank Hermance: It’s a headwind of in the 3% to 4% region.
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: You had mentioned the core growth forecast for ’09 being down mid single, how does that lay out core EIG or EMG?
Frank Hermance: About the same in each.
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: The operating profit on EIG this 24.8% number, given the comments you made earlier about the cost improvements and mix should we perceive that now to be a base level of profitability it seems pretty structural.
Frank Hermance: I don’t think you should. As I said, the mix was unusually good in the fourth quarter both in aerospace and in our process businesses. We just had a really good fourth quarter. I wouldn’t assume that’s the launch point going into 2009.
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: In EIG the flat core growth you had mentioned the process piece of EIG, you just commented it was strong or strength. Those four sub-segments of EIG how did they perform relative to the flat total?
Frank Hermance: You’re talking about for Q4?
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: Just for the fourth quarter.
Frank Hermance: In aerospace we were down slightly, in process we were flat, in power and industrial we were up.
Richard Eastman – Robert Baird: Industrial was actually up?
Frank Hermance: Power was the driver. I’m combining those two.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matt Summerville - Keybanc
Matt Summerville - Keybanc: Based on the acquisitions you’ve completed to date, how much of your business is now MRO for the aerospace?
Frank Hermance: There are two parts to the MRO question. The third party MRO is about $150 million. Then of course we have MRO that’s associated with our OEM business that’s $100 million. The total would be $250 million.
Matt Summerville - Keybanc: I believe you stated that orders were down for the fourth quarter in the range of 10%. Can you give any sort of monthly progression and then what you’re experience has been through the first weeks in January where you have data?
Frank Hermance: Obviously it declined during the fourth quarter which was one of the key factors in us doing the restructuring. To give you a flavor it was on the order of $190 million in October, and in December we were down to the range of $155 million. January is although obviously not finished is better than December. That was somewhat encouraging, although I surely don’t want to call it robust.
Matt Summerville - Keybanc: Early on in the Q&A you provided pretty good detail around aerospace and process. Can you give that same color for power and industrial then the differentiated versus cost driven motor businesses?
Frank Hermance: Sure, I’d be glad to do that. Let’s look at power and industrial. Our power business continued to be strong in the fourth quarter while the industrial business has been impacted by the economic slowdown. Q4 was up low single digits organically driven by strength in power and industrial saw weakness. If we look forward due to weakness in the heavy truck market which is actually projected at a -22% for 2009 we’re also anticipating a slowing of our power business even though we did not see that in the fourth quarter.  Also we’re concerned about the general industrial business. We’re actually projecting a negative high single organic growth for this part of our business in 2009. Its actually we’re saying our weakest segment we may be somewhat conservative there. We want to make sure we get under this thing and not be too optimistic. You sum up for EIG what I talked about previously for aerospace and process and now power and industrial we’re saying all of EIG we’re expecting this negative mid single digit organic growth in 2009. Switching to EMG, differentiated part of EMG continues to be very strong. It’s now about 77% of EMG sales and that’s why you’re seeing such strong performance in essence out of EMG overall. The aerospace part of this business which has a higher military content then the EIG part of the aerospace business is continuing to be strong and it’s expected to be strong in 2009.  However, the economic slowdown in this particular segment impacted our technical motor and EMIT businesses because these are not as long cycle focused in terms of their customer concentration. When you summed all that up Q4 internal growth was down a bit, not significantly but down a bit. We essentially expect the fourth quarter trends to continue and we’re budgeting 2009 sales down slightly.  The problem part of EMG was cost driven motors we struggled in the fourth quarter given the current economic climate. Q4 organic growth was down mid teens. Not unanticipated for this kind of business in the sense that its organic growth is going to be down more then our differentiated types of businesses. We’re expecting the fourth quarter trends to really continue throughout 2009 and we’re budgeting down mid teens organically in 2009 for this part of our business. If you sum that up with slightly down in the differentiated part and down substantially in cost driven that’s how we get to this negative mid single digit organic growth for all of EMG.
Matt Summerville - Keybanc: In terms of your oil and gas business obviously the majority of that’s going to be in process instruments, how should we think about that? I know you talked overall process being down at a mid single digit rate, how big is that business in terms of revenue now and how much of that do you think is driven by the underlying commodity price versus after market versus maintenance.
Frank Hermance: It’s a complex question that you’re asking. Let me see if I can provide some color for it. Of our full process business about a third is actually directly related to what I would say oil and gas. Therefore price of oil is a factor. No question we’re starting to see some impact of that and that’s why the organic growth in process was weakening in the fourth quarter. Just as important in that is the fact that the other parts of that process business which are the remaining two third are also expected to be weak and we saw some weakening in those businesses. What tends to happen in these segments to your point on MRO is that as, for instance in the oil and gas business when exploration tends to go down the after market tends to go up. The reason for that is that plants are looking to increase their productivity. They’re focused more, as we are, as a company on operational excellence. Therefore they want to upgrade the instrumentation in their plants so that they can get better productivity in what is going through it. There is somewhat of a counterbalance in that business that is going to be helpful to us.
Matt Summerville - Keybanc: Have you seen that dynamic in fact start to play out already in that business?
Frank Hermance: I would say yes. We’re starting to see more after market sales in the US in particular. In the refining area etc. Its starting, I wouldn’t say it’s significant yet. Also the downturn in exploration has not really seated at this point either. That dynamic is in process.
Operator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Burke I’d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.
Bill Burke: I’d like to thank everyone for joining the call and we’ll talk to you soon.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to this AMETEK Incorporated Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead sir.
William J. Burke - Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer: Thank you, Rochelle. Good morning everyone and welcome to AMETEK's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Frank Hermance, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and John Molinelli, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Those factors are contained in our SEC filings. I will also refer you to the investor's section of ametek.com for a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures used during this conference call. We'll begin today with some prepared remarks and then we'll take your questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Frank.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Bill. AMETEK had an excellent third quarter. Sales were up 22% to $647.4 million and strong internal growth of 6% and the contributions from acquired businesses. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth and sales was 7%. Also, internal growth in orders was very strong at 7%. Operating income was up 25% and operating income margin expanded 30 basis points. Net income was up 24% and diluted earnings per share were up 25%. Overall we're delighted with these results. Our key markets remain strong. Our strategy of acquiring differentiated businesses is working well and our focus on operational excellence continues to drive profitability. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. Electronic Instruments Group had an excellent quarter. Sales were up 20% on strong core growth of 8% and the contributions from the acquisitions of Cameca, California Instruments, Vision Research and Xantrex Programmable Power. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 9%. The EIG's operating income was up 28% for the quarter. Operating margins improved 140 basis points to 22.4% as compared to 21% in the third quarter of 2007. Electromechanical Group also had a strong quarter with revenues up 26%, solid internal growth of 4% and the contributions from the Reading Alloys, Umeco Repair and Overhaul, Motion Control Group and Drake Air acquisitions drove the revenue growth. The effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 5%. Operating income for the quarter was up 17% to $50.4 million. Operating margins were 17.4% this year as compared to 18.7% last year with a diluted impact of acquisitions, the key driver for the change. In addition to our excellent financial results, we continue to make significant progress in the implementation of our four growth strategies; operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and acquisitions. Operational excellence is the corner stone strategy for the company, and our relentless focused on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. As these business units AMETEK colleagues are implementing initiatives to improve plant productivity, reduce cost and increase capital efficiency. In addition to these business unit level activities, there are some company wide initiatives that are driving significant financial benefits. Our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives have been key drivers to increase profitability in 2008. We expect to generate $20 million in incremental savings this year from these activities. For the first nine months, we have realized $16 million. We are continuing our migration to best cost manufacturing locals, with most in Mexico, Shanghai and the Czech Republic, revenues from these plants is expected to total approximately $365 million to $375 million in 2008, an increase of $40 million to $50 million from 2007. In the third quarter, as the headlines warned of an impending recession, we decided to take additional actions to preserve our bottom-line, even though our key markets remain strong. These actions included aggressive price increase throughout the business to offset larger inflationary cost increases than we had budgeted. These price increases totaled approximately 1% on a full year run-rate basis. We also eliminated a number of plan increases to head count as well as directly reducing head count. The total number of reductions was approximately 225 with annualized savings of about $14 million. These actions were in addition to the $5 million precautionary built tightening initiatives implemented earlier in the year. As we move into the fourth quarter and our planning cycle for 2009, it is becoming clear that there will be a U.S. recession and a slowing international economy. But we believe our exposure to aerospace, power and oil and gas markets will provide a portfolio hedge we will not be immune to a global slowdown. As the result, we will budget cautiously on the top-line and be very aggressive in taking out cost. This approach serviced very well through the last downturn and we believe it will serve us and our shareholders as well in this downturn. Global and market expansion continues to be a driver for our AMETEK's growth. In the third quarter, international sales grew by 19% and were 48% of our total sales. This growth was driven by our process, aerospace, power and Electromechanical products. The few examples are future international growth. Caterpillar Japan has awarded our Vehicle Instrumentation Systems business unit, the Hydraulic Excavator Switch Pad Program. This program is scheduled to launch in 2010, with annualized sales revenue of approximately $5 million. This win reflects the strength of our partnership with Cat for their global instrumentation needs. AMETEK's Solid State Controls was awarded $2.6 million order for battery backup systems for a new nuclear reactor for Korea Electric. This is the first time in over 10 years that South Korea has purchased imported battery backup systems for a new nuclear reactor. The reliability and total cost of our system was recognized as a better value proposition than what was available locally. Another key avenue from internal growth is new product development. We have consistently invested in our RD&E, this year the total is expected to be $121 million, up 18% over the last year. Internal growth reflecting the continued strong level of funding and attractions from design for Six Sigma efforts was a strong 6% overall in the quarter. While no single new product is significant to AMETEK as a whole. We're very excited about some recent customer wins driven by our development efforts. In the third quarter AMETEK aerospace and defense was awarded the electrical heating system on the new Airbus A350. Heaters from our air technology business in the United Kingdom are matched with AFEON [ph] controllers developed in the United States to provide heating to the flight deck, cabin and cargo areas of this aircraft. This is a very significant win for AMETEK with the volume over the life of this aircraft estimated at $215 million. We are actively involved in additional opportunities on the A350 and expect this to be a great platform for us. AMETEK Taylor Hobson has received initial orders for its Taylor serve PGI Blue surface measurement instrument. This sophisticated instrument is aimed at customers that need to measure complex, steep sided optics including manufacturers of Blu-ray DVD players. Two of the leading manufacturers of advanced solar cells have made our Hamilton Precision Metals business units their supplier of choice for stainless steel substrates. The ultra smooth finish of Hamilton's product enables their customers to achieve higher manufacturing efficiencies and lowering the total cost of producing their solar cells. This product has productive sales of over $3 million in the next year. Overall, revenues from products introduced over the last three years was 19% of sales in the first nine months of 2008, up from 18% last year reflecting the excellent work of our businesses and developing the right products to serve their customers. Turning to acquisitions, we have acquired six companies this year representing approximately $240 million in annualized revenue. These are all differentiated businesses that expand our market positions in analytical instrumentation, aerospace MRO, power, technical motors and engineered materials. In July, we announced the acquisition of the programmable power business of Xantrex Technology Inc. With annual sales of approximately $80 million, Xantrex's programmable power division is a leader in alternating current programmable power supplies used to test electrical and electronic products. Xantrex programmable power significantly expands our position in the niche market for programmable power sources and provides us with future opportunities for growth in the highly attractive electronic test and measurement equipment market. The pipeline of acquisition candidates remains strong and we continue to look to add differentiated businesses to AMETEK. We have the financial and managerial capacity to continue to do acquisitions and believe this will be a great environment as the price for acquisitions recedes. There is much concern among investors about the slowing global economy. To date, we have seen minimal impacts to our business, though the events over the last several weeks point clearly to a U.S. recession and a slowing international economy. Our diversified global customer base, significant exposure to long cycle markets, a lack of presence in certain great weak areas of the U.S. economy, and our operational excellence capabilities, provide AMETEK and U.S. investors with a buffer against this economic downturn. Some key points; our customer base is global with approximately 50% of our sales outside the U.S. up from 32% in 2001. Our international markets remain strong. We have significant revenue, approximately $830 million concentrated in the long cycle, aero space and power markets. These businesses should enjoy future growth. In addition, it should be noted that these long cycle businesses have higher than average profitability. We had minimal exposure to the residential housing and automotive markets, two particularly weak areas of the U.S. economy. Also, we have and we will continue to react swiftly to align our cost base with economic realities. This capability enabled us to improve margin throughout the last downturn, one of the few industrial companies to do so. Pulling all of this together, only about 25% of our sales and a smaller amount of our profitability are exposed to the short cycle of U.S, economy. Our higher profit long cycle businesses should continue to perform well in an economic downturn, and we will continue to react swiftly to the realities of the economic environment. Turning to the outlook for 2008; we are optimistic about our prospects for the balance of 2008, and have increased our full year guidance. Our key markets continue to be strong. For the year, revenue is estimated to increase approximately 20%, on mid-single digit core growth in each group, and the annualized impact of acquisitions. Internal growth in Electronic Instruments Group will benefit from continued strength than our long cycle, aerospace and power businesses. In the Electromechanical Group, the core growth will be driven by strong performance in our differentiated businesses. The full year impact of our 2007 acquisitions as well as the impact of the acquisitions we have completed to-date in 2008 will also be a key contributor to the top-line growth. We are raising our earnings estimates from our previous range of $2.50 to $2.54 per diluted share to approximately $2.55 to $2.57 per diluted share, an increase of 20 to 21% over the 2007 level of $2.12 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of 2008, sales are expected to be up approximately 15% over last year's fourth quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.66 to $0.68 per diluted share, an increase of 16% to 19% over last year's fourth quarter of $0.57 cents per delivery share. So in summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Solid internal growth and the contributions from acquired businesses enable us to grow the top-line by 22%. We've enabled to translate the top-line growth into bottom line performance driving strong net income and earnings per share growth. Our key markets continued to be strong. Our operational excellence capabilities, global customer base, exposure to long cycle markets such as aerospace and power, exposure to the energy markets and the impact of our recent acquisitions should enable us to grow both the top and bottom lines and meet our 2008 earnings estimates even as the economy slows,. The pipeline of acquisition candidates remain strong and we continue to look to add differentiated businesses to AMETEK. We look forward to building our track record of success and remain confident that our four growth strategies will continue to create value for our shareholders. John, will now cover some financial details and then we'll be glad to answer your questions. John?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Frank. The results we are reporting today demonstrate a high quality of earnings, strong margins, and a balance sheet well equipped to support our growth plans. As Frank has covered our results at a high level, I will focus on certain areas of interest. Selling expenses were up 21% in the third quarter. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, selling expense increased in line with our core growth. Corporate G&A fell to 1.6% of sales, as compared to 1.9% of sales in last years third quarter. After excluding the charge related to the accelerated vesting restricted stock in the second quarter, we expect our G&A spend for the full year 2008, to be about the same as last year in absolute dollars with 2008 decreasing to 1.6% of sales versus 1.9% of sales for 2007. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.1%, inline with last year's third quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2008 to be approximately 32.5%. As we have said before, this is a full year rate and actual quarterly rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 21.8% of sales for the third quarter, down from last year's third quarter level of 22.7%. We continue to see an opportunity to reduce our working capital investment and we plan to reduce this year's overall percentage going forward. Capital spending was $11 million for the quarter and $31 million for the year-to-date. Depreciation and amortization was $16 million in the quarter and the year-to-date amount is $46 million. For the full year of 2008, we expect the capital expenditures will total approximately $45 million, while depreciation and amortization is expected to be above $65 million. Operating cash flow for the first nine months was excellent, totaling $205 million up 13% over the first nine months of 2007. Total debt was $1.158 billion at September 30th, up $68 million from June 30th. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $166 million resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at quarter end of 42%, up slightly from 41% at the end of the second quarter. These ratios reflect the investment of $120 million for the acquisition of Xantrex's Programmable Power. Over the past 18 months, we have expanded a significant amount of effort to improve the company's capital structure and ensure that adequate liquidity was available to support our growth plans. Result of this work is that AMETEK has significant liquidity available and no significant debt maturities in 2009. To summarize the key actions we have taken during this time. In June 2007, we amended our revolving credit facility to increase its limit from $300 million to $450 million and to extend its maturity date to June 2012. In August 2007, we closed on a private placement for $450 million in long term debt. This 10 and 12 year notes with a waited average... at a weighted average interest rate of 6.2%... 6.25%. In the third quarter of this year, we had several financing transactions. We've paid off $225 million of 7.2% senior notes that reached maturity in July. We received the final $80 million draw of the private placement we entered into in August 2007. On September 17th, we've closed on a new $350 million private placement with a group of institutional investors. The private placement was for 7 and 10 years senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 6.93%. Of the total raised, $250 million was funded at closing with the remaining $100 million to be funded on December 17th. The offering was very well received by the investor base, in a very difficult financing environment reflecting the strength of AMETEK's business model and credit profile. At quarter end, we had approximately $625 million of cash and credit facilities to fund our growth initiatives. Clearly, liquidity is not an issue for AMETEK. Moreover, our debt maturity profile was very distributed. With only the renewal of our $100 million account receivables securitization program required in 2009. In summary, we continue to manage our cost structure and balance sheet effectively, generating excellent cash flow and positioning ourselves for future growth. Bill?
William J. Burke - Vice President Investor Relations and Treasurer: Thanks John. That concludes our prepared remarks. Rochelle we'll be happy to take questions now. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Wendy Caplan with Wachovia Securities.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets, Llc: Thank you. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Wendy.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets, Llc: Frank, when you received your Thursday sheets from your business... from the management team, can you talk about whether there has been any kind of a reportable change in those sheets in terms of how they are viewing there businesses?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well I would say for the key parts of our business there has not been a reportable change. The markets that I talked about in my opening remarks continued to be strong and I would say not a significant change. However, in some spotted areas I would say of the company, we are definitely seeing some impacts of the global slowing. And I'll speak to a few of those to put the proper color on what I mean. For instance, our heavy vehicle business which is a relatively small part of AMETEK, it's about $20 million in volume, the turnaround in that business is clearly moving out in time. The estimates for next year have comedown some from the viewpoint of the agencies that basically look at a number of heavy vehicles that are going to be produced. It's still up year-over-year, but not as strong as predicted just a few weeks ago. Also, we've seen some slowing in our Chemical Products division; again a relatively small part of the company. But they do have some exposure to the automotive markets and that business is weaker. And in a few selected spots internationally as well, we've seen some weakening with Brazil for instance has had some weakening currency related and also of our four care businesses in Western Europe have shown a little bit of slowing. However, in almost all of these cases, it's been offset by a very strong business in other parts of the globe, for instance in this European's softening I was mentioning we've had very strong growth in Asia which offset it. So you don't' see it in a numbers. So I would say in these sorted of very spotted areas we've seen some weakening but overall the business remains very healthy and very strong.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets, Llc: Okay. And just to follow-up with that, you've talked about the heavy vehicle business in the past and how you've encouraged the management to seek other markets for the same product or similar products. Can you help us understand at this point in time which businesses are you kind of keying into, in terms of the ones that would suggest a further slowdown for the company? And can you talk about some of the contingency plans for those businesses?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, absolutely. The key bell leather for us would be our cost driven businesses, where the dynamics in those businesses are essentially cost not as much based on differentiation. So I look very, very keenly at what is happening to our cost driven businesses on a global basis. And the very encouraging thing is in the third quarter they were essentially at about the same level as they were in the second quarter. We didn't see any real deterioration on those businesses globally. As I mentioned, it was a little bit of a slowdown in Europe but offset by strength in Asia. But that is also happened when the economy has been strong we'll see those kinds of tweaks. But that is the leading indicator I would say that I... my focus on in the company. There are a few, a shorter cycle businesses and our instruments group that I' looked at, but they're not as significant in mass. So it's not as critical to AMETEK. In terms of contingencies, we really view ourselves right now as being ahead of the cross curve. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we basically put a $5 million precautionary bill tightening in place at the beginning of the year and then during the third quarter we added another $14 million in profit improvement programs which are... that didn't include the price increase I mentioned which was another 1% or a $20 million plus. So, if you sum all that up, there's about $40 million of improvement we've already put in with in essence no significant change in our market... the key markets I would say. As we go forward, we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side. We're rolling our budgets up right now. We've asked our operating entities to assume lower core growth and they will decide what they mean or what we mean by lower core growth. And I'm sure we'll discuss that during the budget cycles themselves and to be very aggressive on the cost side of the business. So I would expect when we release our earnings at the end of the year, you'll hear from us another round of cost cutting to line ourselves up with the realities of the global economy.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets, Llc: Thank you. And final thing then I'll jump off, could you quantify the impact of the Boeing strike this quarter? And what you are seeing, what you're thinking about it, please?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I can. Basically, the Boeing strike in sales will cost us $4 million to $5 million a month starting on November 1st. So that means that the impact of the Boeing strike if it continued through year-end, could be up to $8 million or $10 million in terms of revenue. The estimates we gave you cover that downside. So in other words, if the strike lasts till the end of the year, our earnings estimates we feel are still solid. In addition, you may have heard this morning that Boeing is going to resume talks tomorrow actually with their union. And I would hope that this strike would be handled well before the end of the year. But that's obviously speculation on my part.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets, Llc: Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet Wendy.
Operator: And next we move on to Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: How are you Jim/
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: John, first house keeping question payables end of the quarter?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President - Chief Financial Officer: Sure Jim, $223 million.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Alright, thank you. And two questions today Frank. First, the price increase that you put through in your comment with regards to commodity inflation. Can you just speak to what you're seeing out there specifically what commodities were impacting you? And given what is evolving in the world today, what do you see in terms of price versus inflation going forward? That's the first question.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, okay. We started at the beginning of the third quarter to become concerned about various commodities that we're increasing, with the primary one being steel. At that time the price of steel was about twice what it was, say a year before that. And we use about 42 million pounds of steel. And when you couple that with the fact that we saw the economy starting to slow, we decided that we would put a pricing increase in place. So we went out all of our operating use, it wasn't just those that were affected by that particular commodity. And we said this is the time to get aggressive on pricing. We put that extra 1% in, and then of course what we have seen across the general level of commodities we use is a price weakening, where the price of copper has come down substantially. I saw in the paper this morning, it was $2.11 a pound. Nickel has come down; at one point nickel was about $22 a pound and it's now about $5 a pound. So, what I would hope is that the result of this price increase as we go forward, would actually more than offset the cost of commodities, and we'd actually see some bottom line improvement across. Of course that's going to be tampered by a likely scenario of reduced organic growth next year.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay. And in terms, of... cause that kind of begged the question that there started to be... some people have started talking about potential deflationary pressure are starting to come back and asking for price cuts in the phase of things like copper and nickel coming down, that's why I was a little bit of a shocked to hear price increase.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Right. Well again it's the timing of when we did it Jim.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay. And then secondly, as the portfolio have evolved and we hear piece mill through the quarter is about aerospace and energy, could you maybe just spend just a moment talking about where specifically the sweet spots for AMETEK is on and both the aerospace and energy side/ And particularly with the price of oil coming down, what your outlook there is?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well it's very difficult to predict to what is going to happen obviously next year. If we look at aerospace first, the backlogs in aerospace are extremely high. Boeing and Airbus combined have about an $800 billion backlogs, 70-500 aircraft. So, it's clearly possible that you'll see some backlogs shrinkage. But even with fairly large or significant amount of backlog shrinkage, the production rates for our next year are still forecasted to be very healthy. Airbus came out and talked about, basically they were not going to increase their production as much as they had originally indicated. And we foresaw those numbers, we got concerned, we went and looked and they're still talking about producing even with that 9% more aircraft next year than this year. So, I think it's reasonably safe to say that for next year, the commercial aircraft production is going to be okay. You could see a weakening in 2010 or 2011. But I think next year at least at this point in time, looks fairly secure. From the viewpoint of the Military Aircraft business, it is just humming for us. And as a result of the fact that we decided to invest in cooling and electronic systems and our orders and that business has actually strengthened through the third quarter. So, very, very good performance, and I don't want to really predict what is going to happen next year. We'll get into that in the budgeting process. But I've seen no indications of weakening. So, and I'm still fairly bullish on aerospace; there is going to be some weakening as the capacity cuts on the MRO side next year. But again, our exposure in particular to the U.S. side of that which is one that's announced the most significant cuts is pretty small, it's about $50 million. So I'm not overly concerned about it. So, right now aerospace still feels okay to me because of where we invested in and the key strength in the military side of the business. In the Energy markets, that's more difficult to predict because the backlogs are not as far out in those particular businesses and we went around and talked to a bunch of our customers and asked them what level the price of oil are going in investments based on, and they came back with numbers in the $50 to $55 a barrel basically as the price that they're investing. So, if we see that price of oil get down in that range, it will definitely have an impact on our business. I look this morning and oil was at $75 a barrel roughly yesterday and at that level, I just think... I think we're still going to be okay. But obviously the margin here is getting narrower and we definitely could have an impact on lot of energy businesses. Now this is the last point I'd make on this is that the process side of our business which is a fairly healthy part of AMETEK, only about half of that business is really related to what I would call the energy markets, the other half is related to other types of activities. So again, the AMETEK portfolio provides some buffer if we do see some shrinkage energy.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay. And finally on acquisition multiples, have you seen any sort of realities starting to creep in there?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I would say that's a good way to word it. We have seen some reality come to play in the acquisition environment and I'll call it the pre-bubble. We were... we are paying multiples in the 7.5 time frame during the bubble when financial debt was very, very easy to give. We saw those multiples go up to the nine times region and I actually did a calculation last night. And what we have bought this year has averaged about eight. And I think we're starting to see that move down and hopefully within the next quarter or two we'll be back to sort of that pre-bubble of level. So we view this is an opportunity. John did a great job and Bill, getting the financing for the company right before the Wall Street blew up in essence. So, we've got the cash and we're going to be aggressive in the acquisition and take advantage of the fact that these multiples are going to go down.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You're bet.
Operator: And next, we move on to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks all. Just a quick question guys on the 225 headcount reduction, I think you have something about 14 million in annual saving. How much of the seven stars that you had to take for that? And did it flow to the P&L this quarter?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, basically we have taken a philosophy as pay as go as you're well aware of the restructurings that we have done. And in essence we have paid for this out of our earnings stream and the amount was not a material amount.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Alright. And then I think you talked about some potential bill typing measures going forward as well. Is there a dollar amount in terms of costing that you are potentially looking at?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, we have not at this point put a specific target on the additional cost reductions that we expect to incur or look at for the fourth quarter and going into next year. We're basically going to go through the entire company. We have a very sophisticated budgeting process. And as I mentioned, we're going to ask our businesses to keep the top-line at a low level in comparison to what they think from an organic growth viewpoint. And we'll put significant pressure on the cost side of the business. And as I mentioned, I would expect that in the January conference call, we'll update you on exactly what we have done in the magnitudes where et cetera.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Fair enough folks. One other follow-up question for you guys. If you were talking about price increases a while earlier was about 2% in Q2, 1% this quarter that's as a tailwind, given the deflect... commodity deflation you're seeing. I'm curious do you see a scenario where those may reverse? And actually may become a headwind so you may have to give back those price increases to the customers?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Let me just talk to your numbers for a moment. Actually in the third quarter, the pricing increases were 2.2%. That was the total for the quarter. And during the quarter we put another 1% in place. So going forward into the fourth quarter that would amount to a number like the 3% price increase, in total. Yes I would definitely expect that our customers overtime will put pressure on us to reduce pricing there's absolutely no question about that. As a matter of fact some of our contracts basically change the pricing as the result of commodities where we cannot in essence put somebody's price increases through. So, we'll definitely have pressure back. However, we believe we're ahead of the curve here. We believe that we struck just at the right time on price increases that to go out today and try to do them would be much more difficult than it was when we put them in place, beginning at the start of the third quarter. And we think we're ahead of the curve and that's where we like to be.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Fair enough. Thanks a lot.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: We'll move on to John Baliotti with FTN Midwest Securities.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities: Good morning. Frank, if I can just a quick question on the deals that, kind of like the business that you're looking at going forward. Are you seeing any change in the over... sort of in very general terms to help of some of those... I mean historically on average the businesses that you buy are smaller. Any dynamic changes in terms of their help?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well I think you're going to see that as time goes on. You're going to see probably a bifurcation where there definitely will be companies out there that I would classify as not good companies that are having major, major earnings problems. And we tend to stay away from those companies. We like to look at companies that are under managed to use our words where in essence the pre-tax profitability of those companies was in the 10% region. And I think we're going to see of more of those available, but I also think you're going to see a lot more companies that almost half the sell because of the economic environment. And in general, we will stay away from the, I'll call them bankrupt companies.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities: Yes. On the other side, on the customer side, obviously given you're the strength to your margins, overall your products are obviously being viewed as more valuable. And I'm wondering in this environment is there any change in customers as they make some head count cuts and some cost cuts, are they leaning on you more for more of the work they might have been doing in the past? Is that a dynamic change at all that you're seeing now? Or is that been... is that the same thing that's been going on for a while?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I haven't seen that dynamic to any large degree, I mean I'm sure some of our business, we are seeing some of that. But it's not a meaningful factor in our performance at least at this point.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities: Has it been in terms of AMETEK being more of doing more some would say, some of the development work for them that maybe in the past let's say 5 or 10 years ago, they may have been doing themselves?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well I think we've seen a general trend in that direction over the last 5 or 10 years. But I don't think it's... we haven't seen it accelerate in the last few months.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities: Right.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think the full impacts of what's happened in the last few months are obviously still embedded in our customers yet. But that very well could happen and we could see more of it. We've seen that in aerospace in the past where when things weakened, they'll basically have more outsourcing of their engineering activities and we will benefit from that.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities: Alright. Okay, great. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: And our next question, we'll hear from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thanks, good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Just would love a little detail on the underlying operating margins at the business especially with the Xantrex in at the Instruments Group maybe not much of an impact this quarter maybe a month. But what's active and underlying? And going forward, what kind of impact from Xantrex would we be think about?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I can't specifically answer your question on Xantrex. I haven't run those numbers. But I can give you this detail that when I spoke to the margins in the company being up 30 basis points, there was about 85 basis points of dilution due to all the acquisitions that we have done. That's the calculation that we have run. So we are definitely... and we'll continue to see a dilution on the margins. But obviously our overall margins are up, which means the core business, the margins are superlative. And we think this is the right model, because the return on invested capital when we buy these companies at a 10% pre-tax, even though there's some dilution on the margins themselves, the actual return because we'll take these 10% companies. And as you know in a very short period of time make them 20% companies. The return on invest of capital is just off the charts and that's the right utilization of cash from our view point. And we'll accept some dilution on the top-line due to those acquisitions.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then any chance of getting the 85 base points dilution at the segment level? Or at least directionally assume greater impacted EMG obviously?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Actually not. It was about the same in each of those our businesses. So there was not a substantial change. Remember we've got a bunch of acquisitions, some last year, some this year. There's probably 8 to 10 acquisitions rolling through those numbers. So the total amount was about the same on each part of the company.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then lastly, the oil and gas stuck with the $50 or $55 barrel threshold, if that's the literal level, what's the anticipatory factor if arguably and freefall or at least prospects that, is that investment anticipates well ahead of that literal level of oil?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's a question that I can't answer in reality. I mean, it's very difficult and it's going to vary from customer to customer. But, I don't think that there's going to be panic in the major change in the investment levels until you get down near that level.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Thanks. I appreciate it.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And next we move on to Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Just a couple of questions. Frank, can you remind us back in 2001 to 2002 how much of your business you would characterize as cost driven/ And then where that run rate was in the third quarter?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: From my recollection, it was on the order of a third of our business. And now, it's on the order of approaching 10% of our business.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay, great, thanks. And then you typically go into a little bit more detail on the division performance by segment for the quarter, can you go into that please?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I mean take a walk through the company?
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Yes.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Is that what you're asking Matt? Sure. Yes I have some notes here that I'll read from. If with start with EIG, as in mentioned in my opening remarks, sales were up 20% for all of EIG in Q3 with very good organic growth of 8% and if the currency is included, that organic growth would have or just 9%. I've already mentioned our long cycle aerospace business, the markets remain strong. Boeing and Airbus again have very strong backlogs, Session this backlog as $15.6 billion, that's up $3 billion since last year end. And they are sold out for three years at the 2009 bill trade, and Session is a very large customer of our. So we're going to enjoy a continued strength with them. As I mentioned, the military business was very, very strong in the quarter, again given our focus on electronics and helicopters. Organic growth for aerospace was up high single-digits in the quarter and for the full year we expect internal growth to be up high single-digits. So very, very good performance. Our Process businesses remain strong during the quarter, in particular, three of our divisions in this area; Process and Analytical Instruments Measurement Calibration Technology and our Advance Measurement Technology divisions were very, very strong. The new products are doing well. Q3 internal growth and the process businesses was up high single-digits. Total growth with acquisitions was up high teens on a percentage basis and for the full year organic growth should be up mid single-digits. And the last part of the Instruments Group which is power and industrial continues to do well. Q3 was up high single-digits organically driven by strength in power. With acquisitions it was up about 40%. So very, very strong performance here. Full year organic sales are expected to be up at least mid single-digits and we might get even a little higher than that if things go well. The other half of the company; the Electromechanical Group as I mentioned in my opening remark sales were up 26% in the quarter. Organic growth here was 4%, 5% if currency is included. The differentiated part of EMG continues to be very strong. It's now about 75% of EMG sales. Aerospace and defense related businesses were very strong in the quarter. Our Engineer Material Interconnect and Packaging business also had an excellent quarter. Q3 internal growth was up high single-digits. Total growth with acquisitions was up approximately 40%. Full year organic sales were expected to be up high single-digits. So again very story. And our cost driven motor's business was doing fine and we are so much surprised actually. Q3 growth was down slightly, which is where we where in Q2. It was down slightly then. And as you are aware, we run this business for maximum profitability versus growth. And we're continuing to move production at low cost locals including our China, Mexico and Czech Republic plants. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we expect another $40 million to $50 million to be in those plants for 2008. We also have a very keen focus on Lean efficient manufacturing low cost region sourcing for this business and for all of AMETEK are low cost region sourcing is going to provide in 2008 about $20 million worth of savings. So, we expect here the full year organic growth is actually expected to be roughly flat. And for Q4, we actually expect even a little bit of growth in this part of our business. So, it's hanging in there. So, you sum all this up and the picture is pretty damn good right now.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: As you look across going through, progressing through the quarter, did you see any major change in order rates as the quarter progressed?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No. Actually we had a fairly strong September. And the orders were essentially flat, steady. Yes, John words are better, steady.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Next, we move on to Richard Eastman with Robert Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Could you give us an order number for the quarter for the third quarter? And how the core orders performed year-over-year?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I'm doing it from memory John. Look if it I think it's 641, $641 million, is that right? John's looking it up. And the core growth was 7%.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: So okay. So matched, okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: 641 the right number, Rick.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: I'm sorry?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It was 641.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Thank you. And then also Frank, when you look at the margin profile of the business overall and really by segment as well, as we move forward it appears as though the EMG margins maybe have flattened out around the 17.5% mark. And EIG perhaps as well in the 22... low 22% range. And it's the strategy here, we're bumping price to get ahead of the cross curve. We also have some mix influence in the business. But if the volumes fall off, I mean, should we be thinking that margins remain flat here at this reasonably high level? Probably you're kind of looking at this over the next 12 months. We're taking cost out, we're raising prices, we've got a mixed influence. But again if we start to look a lower core growth rate, are we putting extreme effort into trying to maintain the margins here?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: There's no question there's going to be a significant energy put into not only maintaining our margins, but trying to improve. And it surely it's going to be more difficult as the organic growth of our business as we see it which is going to happen as we go forward. However, having said that, this really speaks to the strength of AMETEK. We are really good at the cost side of the business, and we're going to be very aggressive on the cost side. And I'm not going to predict next year exactly what the margins are going to be. It would be impossible for me to do that right now, given the dynamics that are going on. But that will be a key focus in our budgeting process. And I feel I've got a lot of levers to pull to not only to keep the margins where they are, but hopefully even show some improvement. The biggest issue we're going to have on margins is the dilution impact of acquired companies.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Okay alright. And then just a last question, geographically, you talked a bit about the growth rate. I think you said 48% or 49% of sales were international. But obviously the concern these days is about international business perhaps slowing down, especially in Europe. And did you see any change in your order pattern geographically during the quarter? Or are you more concerned going forward about your international operations?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The order patterns were good. We looked at it on a worldwide basis and in essence orders were up and relatively healthy in all parts of the world. There was this spotty business I talked about in answer to one of the previous questions regarding some of the cost driven businesses in Europe showed some weakness in the quarter. But that was an essence offset in Asia. And yes I'm obviously concerned about the whole worldwide economy not just in any specific part of the world. I mean the cover of the Wall Street Journal this morning was with China's growth was basically moving from the 10% kind of growth area kind of 11% down to 8% to 9%. So I don't think there's any question about what we're going to see a slowing global economy. And we're just going to have to deal with it as it happens.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird: Okay. Well thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Burke, for any additional or closing remarks.

Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Bill. AMETEK had an excellent second quarter. Sales were up 25% to $648.8 million on strong internal growth of 7% and the contributions from acquired businesses. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 10%. Order growth was very strong as well, with total work orders up 24% in the quarter. Internal growth and orders was excellent at 6%. On May 19th, the company announced a performance-based accelerated vesting of a restricted stock award made in April of 2005. The accelerated vesting occurred as a result of the stock price doubling in the three years since the issuance of the grant, reflecting a significant value that has been created for AMETEK shareholders. In the quarter, the company recognized an after-tax non-cash charge of $7.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share related to the performance vesting. Excluding this charge, operating income was up 26%, driven by the top line growth and operational excellence improvements, resulting in a 20 basis point improvement in operating income margin. Net income and diluted earnings per share were each up 26%. Cash flow from operations was excellent totaling $142 million on a year-to-date basis, up 18% over last year's first half. Overall, we're delighted with these results. Our markets are strong. Our strategy of acquiring differentiated businesses is working well and our focus on operational excellence continues to drive profitability. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups, the Electronic Instruments Group had an excellent quarter. Sales were up 22% on strong core growth of 9% and the contributions from the acquisitions of Cameca, California Instruments, Advanced Industries, B&S Aircraft Parts and Vision Research. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 11%. EIGs operating income was up 26% for the quarter. Operating margins improved 70 basis points to 22.8% as compared to 22.1% in the second quarter of 2007. The Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter, with revenues up 29%, solid internal growth of 6% and the contribution from the Reading Alloys, Hamilton Precision Metals, Umeco, Motion Control Group, Drake Air, and Seacon Phoenix acquisitions drove the revenue growth. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 8%. Operating income for the quarter was up 21% to $53.1 million. Operating margins were 17.4% this year as compared to 18.4% last year with the dilutive impact of acquisitions, a key driver for the change. In addition to our excellent financial results, we continue to make significant progress in the implementation of our four growth strategies; operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development, and acquisitions. Operational excellence is the cornerstone strategy for the company and our relentless focus on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. At each business unit, AMETEK colleagues are implementing initiatives to improve plant productivity, reduce costs and increase capital efficiency. In addition to these business unit level activities, there are some company wide initiatives that are driving significant financial benefits. Our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives are expected to be a key driver for increased profitability in 2008. We expect to generate $19 million in incremental savings this year from these activities, up from our previous estimates of $16 million. In the second quarter, we realized $6.1 million and for the first half, we realized $10.7 million from this initiative. In 2008, we are continuing our migration to best costs manufacturing locales; Reynosa Mexico, Shanghai, and the Czech Republic. Revenue from these plants is expected to total approximately $365 million to $375 million in 2008, an increase of $40 million to $50 million from 2007. In the second quarter, revenue from our best cost facilities was $88 million, an increase of 9% over the second quarter of 2007. Global & Market Expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEK's growth. In the second quarter, international sales grew by 21% and were 47% of our total sales. This growth was driven by our process, aerospace, power and electromechanical products. Our Vehicle Information Systems business booked a $20 million, four-year contract with Kamaz, a Russian heavy truck manufacturer for the supply of instrumentation clusters. To support the international growth of our Aerospace MRO business, in the quarter we opened a new sales office in Dubai to service the leading carriers in that region. Another key avenue for internal growth is new product development. We have consistently invested in RD&E. This year, the total is expected to be $116 million, up 13% over last year. Internal growth reflecting the continuous strong level of funding and the traction from our design for Six Sigma efforts, was a strong 7% overall in the second quarter. While no single new product is significant to AMETEK as a whole, we're excited about some recent customer wins driven by our development efforts. Our Aerospace division has developed a dual circuit air oil cooler for the General Electric NX engine. This engine powers the new Boeing 747-8 aircraft. There are four engines per aircraft and one cooler per engine, representing approximately $36 million in revenue over the life of the program. Our ORTEC business unit was awarded a $1.3 million contract for radiation detectors to be used at the upcoming Beijing Olympics. Our upstream oil and gas business unit has recently introduced a series of new sub-sea transmitters used to measure pressure and temperature in the natural gas industry. These instruments, which support the trends towards deeper water drilling, sit on the ocean floor at depths up to 16,000 feet and provide important feedback to field operators. We expect revenue of approximately $3 million per year from each of these products. Solidstate Controls was awarded a $1.3 million contract from Trans-Canada for UPS systems for a major pipeline project that will ultimately connect the Canadian Oil Sands with refineries in the U.S. Drake Air has received FAA approval for its new matrix recor [ph] process on the Boeing 777 primary heat exchanger. This repair process involves replacing a damaged or faulty core with a newly manufactured Drake core, yielding a light new unit. Drake has been endorsed by the OEM as the heat exchanger to service these units. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 20% of sales in the first half of 2008, up from 18% last year, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. Turning to acquisitions, we've acquired five companies this year, representing approximately $160 million in annualized revenue. These are all differentiated businesses that expand our market positions in analytical instrumentation, aerospace MRO, technical motors, and engineered materials. In the second quarter, we acquired two companies. In April, we announced the acquisition of Reading Alloys, a privately-held niche specialty metals producer. With annual sales of approximately $80 million, Reading is a global leader in specialty titanium master alloys and highly engineered metal powders used in the aerospace, medical implant, military and electronics market. Reading's titanium master alloys are experiencing outstanding growth, driven by increasing demand for titanium in the commercial aerospace, military aerospace, and power generation markets. 80% of Reading's sales are in aerospace and defense applications. In June we acquired Vision Research. With annual sales of $37 million, Vision is a leading privately-held manufacturer of high-speed digital imaging systems used for motion capture and analysis in test and measurement applications, including aerospace and defense, general industrial, and research and development. It's highly differentiated products include a broad array of high-speed digital cameras for capturing data in product characterization, and motion analysis applications. Vision, a solidly profitable growing business sells to a diversified blue-chip customer base including GE, Boeing, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Toyota and Nike. Pipeline of acquisition candidates remain strong and we continue to look at differentiated businesses to AMETEK. We have the financial and managerial capacity to continue to do acquisitions and believe this would be a great environment for us. There is much concern among investors about the slowing U.S. economy. To date, we have seen only minimal impacts to our business. Our diversified global customer base, significant exposure to long cycle markets, our lack of presence in certain very weak areas of the U.S. economy and our operational excellence capabilities provide AMETEK and U.S. investors with a buffer against an economic slow down. Some key points. Our customer base is global with approximately 50% of our sales outside the U.S., up from 32% in 2001. The international markets are doing very well. We have significant revenue, approximately $750 million, concentrated in the long cycle aerospace and power markets. These businesses should enjoy a number of years of solid growth. In addition, it should be noted that these long cycle business have higher than average profitability. We had minimal exposure to the residential housing and automotive markets to particularly weak areas of the U.S. economy. Also, when necessary, we will react swiftly to align our cost base with economic realities. This capability enabled us to improve margins throughout the last downturn, one of the few industrial companies to do so. In addition, as a precautionary measure, we included general bill tightening improvements in our 2008 budget. Putting all of this together, only about 25% of our sales and a smaller amount of our profitability are exposed to the short cycle U.S. economy. Our higher profit long cycle businesses should continue to perform well in an economic downturn, and when needed we have the ability to react swiftly to properly size our operations to continue our strong profitability. Turning now to the outlook for 2008, we are very optimistic about our prospects for the balance of 2008 and are increasing our guidance. Our key markets continue to be very strong. For the year, revenue is estimated to increase approximately 20% on mid single-digit core growth in each group and the annualized impact of acquisitions. Internal growth for the Electronic Instruments Group will benefit from continued strength in our aerospace, power and process businesses. In the Electromechanical Group, the core growth will be driven by strong performance in our differentiated businesses. The full year impact of our 2007 acquisitions as well as the impact of the acquisitions we have completed to date in 2008 will also be a key contributor to the top line growth. We are raising our earnings guidance from our previous range of $2.42 to $2.47 per diluted share to approximately $2.50 to $2.54 per diluted share, an increase of 18% to 20% over the 2007 level of $2.12 per diluted share. For the third quarter of 2008, sales are expected to be up approximately 20% over last year's third quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.61 to $0.63 per diluted share, an increase of 15% to 19% over last year's third quarter of $0.53 per diluted share. In summary, we're delighted with our performance in the second quarter. Solid internal growth and the contribution from acquired businesses enabled us to build the top line by 25%. We've been able to translate the top line growth into bottom line performance, driving strong net income and earnings per share growth. 2008 is shaping up to be another great year. Our key markets continue to be very strong. Our operational excellence capabilities, global customer base, exposure to long cycle aerospace and power markets and the impact of our recent acquisitions, should enable us to grow both the top and bottom lines and meet our earnings estimates, even as the U.S. economy slows. The pipeline of acquisition candidates remains strong and we continue to look to add differentiate businesses to AMETEK. We look forward to building on our track record of success during 2008 and remain confident that our four growth strategies will continue to create value for our shareholders. John will now cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Frank. The results we are reporting today demonstrate a high quality of earnings, strong margins, and a balance sheet well equipped to support our growth plans. As Frank has covered these, our results at a high level, I will focus on particular areas of interest. Selling expenses were up 28% in the second quarter. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, selling expense increased in line with our core growth. After excluding the charge related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock, corporate G&A fell to 1.5% of sales, as compared to 1.8% of sales in last year's second quarter. On a similarly adjusted basis, we expect G&A spend for the full year 2008 to be about the same as last year in absolute dollars with 2008 decreasing to 1.6% of sales versus 1.9% of sales in 2007. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.7%. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2008 to be approximately 32.5% to 33%. As we've said before, this is a full year rate and actual quarterly rates can vary dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, was 20.5% of sales for the second quarter, down from last year's second quarter level of 21.3%. We continue to see an opportunity to reduce our working capital investment. Our plans are to reduce this overall percentage in 2008. Capital spending was $11 million for the quarter and $20 million for the year-to-date. Depreciation and amortization was $16 million in the quarter, and up $30 million year-to-date. For the full year of 2008, we expect that capital expenditures will total approximately $50 million while depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $65 million. Operating cash flow in the first half was excellent, totaling $142 million, up 18% over the first half of 2007. We expect operating cash flow for the company to be roughly $335 million for the full year, up 20% from last year. In keeping with our previously stated strategy of opportunistically repurchasing common stock to offset diluted impact of our benefit plans, during the first half, we expended $57.4 million repurchasing approximately 1.26 million shares of our common stock. Approximately 260,000 of those shares were acquired in the second quarter. At June 30th, approximately $18.5 million remains under the current Board authorization. Total debt was $1.09 billion at June 30th, up $186 million from March 31st. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $142 million, resulting in a net debt to capital ratio at quarter end of 41%, up slightly from 38% at the end of the first quarter. These ratios reflect the investment of $203 million in acquisitions and repurchase of $14 million of common stock during the quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, we paid off the maturing $225 million of public debt and received the final $80 million draw of the private placement we entered into in August 2007. After affecting for the debt transactions subsequent to quarter end, we had approximately $450 million of cash and credit facilities available to fund our growth initiatives. In summary, we continue to manage our cost structure and balance sheet effectively generating excellent cash flow and positioning ourselves for future growth. Bill?
William J. Burke - Vice President, Investor Relations: Thanks, John. Jody, that completes our prepared remarks. So we'll be happy to take questions now. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Jim Lucas of Janney Montgomery Scott.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning Jim.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: John, first housekeeping question. Accounts payable in the quarter?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure Jim. $253 million.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Alright, thank you. And Frank, two questions. First, on the aerospace and defense side, if you could just give us your quarterly update on what you are seeing in the markets, particularly on the commercial side. And secondly, you have been making a number of investments in China and Russia, now Dubai. Could you maybe just give us a little insight into the thought process of how you go about identifying where the geographies you want to make the investments and what we could expect to see going forward?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure Jim. Let me start with Aerospace and Defense. Those businesses are doing just great right now. The markets are very strong. There is a strength in all parts of the business. Boeing and Airbus are producing at high levels as is Cessna. The combined backlog for Boeing and Airbus is more than 7300 aircrafts and represents more than $750 billion. For 2008, Boeing deliveries will be up about 9% and Airbus up about 5%. Cessna's backlog is $16 billion, and it's up $3.4 billion since year-end and is sold out for the next three years. The Military business is very strong, especially given our focus on helicopters and electronics cooling. For the quarter, organic growth was up double-digits actually for our full aerospace business. And total growth with acquisitions was even a much higher number. And for 2008, we're very optimistic. We think there's going to be continued growth and the internal growth should be at least high single-digits and may be a little bit higher. Now there is two points that I want to comment on specifically addressing commercial aerospace, Jim. One is there has been concern expressed throughout the industry about capacity reductions, particularly in the U.S. We went back and looked at our commercial MRO business in the U.S. and it's less than $50 million. It's actually around $45 million. And the reductions that they're talking about... potential reductions in capacity, which wouldn't take effect until well into next year, are about 10%, which means the impact on us is sort of in the rounding of our aerospace business, it just isn't a major factor. And the other point is there also have been some press comments regarding backlog reductions at the large commercial OEMs, namely Airbus and Boeing. We've taken a look at that, and I think the first point is that only about 12% of their backlogs is in the U.S. environment, most of their backlog is outside the U.S. And the second point is, even if there were some reductions, which actually Boeing and Airbus are saying there won't be on a short-term, those reductions, they be filled by other spots. And matter of fact, I read something over the weekend where the CEO of Airbus basically said if they had to reduce capacity, it would not be until 2010. So, we're feeling very, very confident in our aerospace and defense business with commercial being very strong. It's 40% of our total aerospace business and even if we can the slight bit, our military end business and regional aircraft business is so strong that we're just not concerned about it. We think it's going to be a phenomenal few years of continued good performance in aerospace and defense. Your second question, regarding international expansion as we have talked about for a number of years, our intent is to continue to incrementally expand internationally. When I first came with AMETEK about 10% of our sales were outside the U.S. and we are now hovering around 50% of our sales. Our objective is to move the company in an incremental fashion to about 60% outside the U.S. And that's driven by the fact that when we sum up all of our markets, we think 60% of the opportunity is outside the U.S. In your specific question of how do we identify where we do this and where we expand, we basically do strategic planning meetings with every one of our operations and we ask them to identify where the major growth opportunities are for their business. And then at the corporate level we look at that and say where are the areas in the world that service the larger numbers of our divisions and/or the highest profit potential for multiple divisions and decide to invest there. And that's driven the China expansion, it's driven the Russian expansion, and now what's happening in Dubai is just unbelievable, what's occurring over there. They're putting major infrastructure into Dubai and we just see it as a super opportunity, so we're going to continue to expand there. And we'll just continue this process of incrementally putting investments and to move the company into that higher content region in international type markets.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: And to that point, are there any other of those geographies that you've identified where you are not participating today?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I would say the one area that we need and will over time incrementally invest is India. We have looked at the manufacturing infrastructure there and it's just not good at this point of time. It's hard to even travel from city to city in India, so we decided not to invest heavily in manufacturing in India at this point of time. But that will change over time, because they'll improve that and we'll see an opportunity to expand there. But we put it a little bit lower on the list. We are doing back office stuff in India, where we had distribution capability there as well, but we haven't taken the step to go a little bit further in that part of the world. So it's probably the next one that you will be hearing from our side.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go now to Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Amit.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Good morning, Amit.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Just a follow up on the commercial aviation MRO side of the business. I think the platform is about $100 million revenues for us. How much of that is U.S. centric versus international?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it's about 45% in the U.S. and 55% outside the U.S., that's how I got to that $45 million number that I mentioned to in response to Jim's question.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Got it.And so that's a part of this as we could potentially see a low belt softening as it takes some capacity out down the road.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it's possible. That's what I'm saying, there could be maybe a 10% shift in that business, which could be, on the order of $4 million or $5 million which is in the rounding of our aerospace business.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Right, fair enough. And then just on the inventory side, looks like you turned it up about 35%. How much of that was ex-acquisitions and FX?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You've got that, John?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: I do. Just give me just a second to find out. The inventory grew in line with our core growth, Amit and I can give you the absolute dollars quickly. But we had a 7% growth in our core inventory... inventories associated with the core businesses. I think that's your point, you're looking for at.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, again back into the realm... the dollar number.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The acquisition is over $29 million of that change.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Perfect.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Alright. And then just finally, could you just talk about commodity inflation and how that's impacting you guys and on a net pricing basis, are we still positive?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, no question, we're still positive. We looked at this very strongly in the second quarter and our pricing was very, very good in the second quarter. And it more than offset the commodity impacts on the input side. And there are some different forces happening on the commodity input side. The three key commodities that impact us are steel, and to a higher degree copper and nickel. And steel and copper did actually go up, but nickel went down quite significantly. So there was a counter balance in our commodity impacts in the quarter. And I just want to make the point that I made before that we are impervious to this because the way we manage the business, we simply are able to offset what occurs on the input side through other initiatives. As an example, in our specialty metals business, we actually clot and when we take an order, we use the spot price of the metal on the day we essentially take the order and then we buy forward on that material. We don't speculate. We have the order, it's in our backlog, but we buy forward and therefore the profit on that particular order is locked in. So we take the risk out of the equation and that's why, in general you've heard no issues from us as the commodities have swung all over the place in the last several years.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Fair enough. Thank you, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You between, Amit.
Operator: We will go next to Ned Borland at Next Generation Equity Research.
Ned Borland - Next Generation Equity Research: Hi, good morning guys. Just one question on the EMG, operating margins of 100 basis points below last year. Can you give us some color on what's going on there?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I mean our thought process was going into this year, we're going to be very aggressive on acquisitions. We see an opportunity to significantly use the cash flow from the company to do more acquisitions than are norm and we've already met our target for the whole year in the first six months and we're surely not going to stop here. So, it's going to be a very, very good environment for acquisitions. One of the impacts when you do those acquisitions, especially with our stated philosophy where we like to buy companies that are 10% kind of pre-tax and we move them up to 20% number in very short order. One of the negatives is that, there is some dilution to the margins of the company. However, when you look at that on a return on invested capital view point, the return on invested capital is off the charts. So we believe that's the right economic equation to use and in fact that's what happened in EMG. We did a large number of acquisitions. It was unbalanced in terms of revenue in the second quarter with much higher amount of revenue in EMG than EIG and therefore, we basically had some margin dilution and that was the prime driver.
Ned Borland - Next Generation Equity Research: Okay so, because of the accelerated activity in EMG and acquisitions, it weighed down the margins, but that should lift over time?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It should lift overtime unless we continue to do more acquisitions in EMG of the magnitude that we have done on a sort of percent of sale basis.
Ned Borland - Next Generation Equity Research: Okay, great. Thanks.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And we'll now go to John Baliotti of FTN Midwest Securities Corporation.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: Hi, good morning. Frank, I was wondering if you could do your quarterly sub-segment discussion when you go through the sub pieces of the EIG/EMG, and when you do that could you also may be comment on some either by end market or by geography, if there's anything that changed as you entered versus exited the quarter? I think some companies with similar characteristics of yours; the market has been very positively surprised. I think they've expected these end markets to have changed so dramatically in three months. I am just curious to see what kind of color you have on that?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Right. Well, let me sort of address your second question first and then I'll come back as I walk through the company.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: Thanks.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: But I've seen no fundamental change in the end markets with potentially one... a somewhat minor exception in terms of the overall company. But I think it's worth mentioning and that's the heavy truck business. As you know, we have $20 million to $30 million of exposure to heavy trucks. And one of the dynamics that has happened there is that although for all of 2008 versus 2007, the markets... the market itself is going to be roughly flat up slightly. The dynamic was that the first quarter was down substantially in terms of truck production. It was down like 30% plus, which actually means on a quarter-over-quarter basis going forward; it's going to be much better. So we're seeing a better performance out of our business and you'll hear that in the numbers when I walk through each of the sub-segment, so if anything, the markets are little bit better than what they were.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: Okay. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So let me walk through, I'll start with the EIG. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, for EIG overall sales were up 22% in the quarter, organic growth was 9% with 11% if currency is included. I have already walked generally through Aerospace, so I won't spend any more time on it. It's obviously very-very good and we're expecting internal growth to be in the high single-digits for the year. The process businesses and if the markets are very strong, they are driven by the price of oil. Our material analysis Ultra Precision Metrology and measurement calibration instrument businesses were particularly strong in the quarter. The new products that you heard some of those in my opening comments are doing very well. Q2 internal growth was up high single-digits. Total growth with acquisitions was up more than 20%, and we expect the good growth to continue and obviously having oil where it is, is a very, very significant factor for this business. So for 2008, we're saying the internal growth should be up conservatively mid single-digits. I actually think there is a very, very good chance, it's going to be higher than that. For Power and Industrial in EIG, the Power and Industrial businesses continue to do very well. Q2 was up high single-digits organically. It was driven by strength in power and then the improved conditions that I talked to you about in terms of heavy trucks. In the first quarter, all of power and industrial was only up mid single-digits and now we are up in essence high single-digits because of that comparison item in the heavy truck market. So for all of 2008, we are expecting power and industrial to have high single-digit organic growth, so we are very, very positive on that business. Switching over EMG, for all of EMG, sales were up 29% in the quarter. Organic growth was 6%, 8% of currency is included and if I segment this into the differentiated part of EMG versus the cost driven part of EMG, in the differentiated part of EMG, the business continues to be very strong, is now 72% of EMG sales. So a very significant shift in the make up of EMG essentially diversifying away from the cost-driven motor business. In the differentiated part of EMG, our aerospace and defense related businesses were very strong in the quarter. Our engineered materials, interconnect and packaging business also had an excellent quarter. Q2 internal growth was up high single-digits. Total growth with acquisitions was up approximately 40% and that goes to the question about some of the margin dilution because of the very high content of acquisitions in the EMG part of the business. And we expect a very good growth in 2008, with organic growth up at least mid single-digits and possibly higher. In terms of cost-driven motors, it's doing fine. Q2 growth was down just slightly. As you're aware, we run this business from maximum profitability versus growth. We're continuing the movement of productions to lower cost locales including China, Mexico and the Czech Republic. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, last year we did about $325 million for the whole company in those low cost regions and we're going to add another $40 million to $50 million this year and we're right on target to make that happen. And also in the cost-driven motors area, we have a very strong focus on lean efficient manufacturing and low cost regions sourcing. And the low cost region sourcing is just starting to really, really take on some energy in the company. Again as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're now forecasting across the entire company from both the low cost sourcing region activities as well as the strategic procurement initiative we have, about $19 million of savings for the year, and that's up from our previous estimates of $16 million and I expect we're conservative on the $19 million number. So for cost-driven motors, for 2008, sales are expected to be flat and our profits are again expected to be up double-digits, so pretty consistent theme from us.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities Corporation: Great. Thanks, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And we'll go next to Matt Summerville at KeyBanc.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Two questions. First, can you comment Frank on what you saw in terms of order tempo as we moved through the quarter and what you're seeing thus far in July across the company?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. The order tempo was interesting. The first month was very strong. When we saw the May results, they were down a little bit and I was actually starting to get a little nervous that we started to see some of the slow down that AMETEK has been able to sort of circumvent and then June was gangbusters. This is no other way of saying, it was extremely strong. Now, part of that is also due to the number of days in each of the months as well. But... so when I sum all this up, orders were great, we're up 24% on orders. We had 6% organic growth on orders and it was across the board. We really did not have the sizable weaknesses anywhere and July has started off great. And I get weekly reports from each of our divisions, and I'm feeling optimism around the loop right now. So I'm feeling pretty good about it.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And then can you talk about a little more color in terms of what you're doing as far or what you have done or what you're going to do in terms of general belt tightening and how much you kind of ...how much is flow through the P&L with regards to that?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, it's a very difficult question to answer because each one of our divisions has very extensive cost reduction activities that offset the investments and volume and our margin issues that are occurring in each business. But in general, at the end of last year, we just had concern as to how strong this year was going to be. So we went ahead and put in about $5 million of what I'll call incremental cost reductions, more than what was in essence in the initial budget. And we've watched that as the year has gone on, and we obviously, we added $3 million more with the sourcing activities that I just talked about. And we haven't really accumulated the rest of it that has been done through the year, because we really don't need to since our energy is really focused on growth because our business is growing so fast right now. So it's probably the best way I can answer your question, Matt.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great. Thanks a lot, Frank.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And we'll go now to Christopher Glynn at Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Good morning. Thank you. Question on just looking ahead what commodities might do, take the case of a deflationary commodity cost environment and how would that be managed? What would be some of the possibilities around that and I guess related to that, can you estimate what you got from price in the quarter?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Let's handle the deflation issue first. We will get some uplift in terms of profitability for those contracts where we have fixed pricing in place, so that if in essence there is a deflationary impact, we will get some improvement on the bottom line from that. However, as I mentioned before, for many of our businesses, we actually have cost adjustments and/or we do hedging again not hedging in the sense of speculation, but hedging in the sense of buying forward on material where we have orders. So in essence, you'll see no positive impact in terms of the profit that comes out of that. You will see a positive impact on profit margin though. But you won't see it in terms of profit dollar. So the best way to think of AMETEK is, we're relatively immune to changes in commodity prices either up or down. In terms of the price escalators in the second quarter, it was roughly 2% in terms of price second quarter over second quarter, which we were pleased with.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay. And then just a bit on the third quarter EPS guidance. Typically, second quarter or third quarter, roughly in line and the comparable number this year would maybe the $0.68 adjusted for the second quarter and the $0.61 to $0.63 you did, below that. Could you just speak to that a little bit?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Our third quarter with such a large portion of our business in international particularly in Europe is a little bit weaker. So you have to be careful looking at the trend from second quarter to third quarter when you look at us over a number of years. So if you look at the second half, the $0.61 to $0.63 we think is a reasonable kind of number for the second quarter and obviously if you look at our year achievement in the third quarter, if you look at our year guidance, we are obviously expecting a very strong fourth quarter as we also had... had last year and I have never going to accused of being aggressive on our estimates either so.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Right. Okay, so no incremental activity or notable impact from acquisition integrations in the third quarter versus second?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, that is exactly correct.
Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer: Okay, thanks a lot.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: And we'll go now to Rich Eastman of R. W. Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just two questions. Frank, could you just break down the geographic sales, maybe core LC growth first at 7% corporate number, how did that look in the second quartet?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't have that actually broken out, what I... the numbers that are have in my head are the total growth. And in international overall, it was up 21%, 22% and it was very strong in Europe. It was up about 24% in Europe, it was up about 23% in Asia. So overall, it was good. I don't have the core growth by region, not in my head.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then secondly, we talked a little bit about price, we talked about the purchase price variance in the quarter. When you look at the gross margin line and you look at that year-over-year, how much do you think you nodded [ph] in price? Would you have sense for that?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: percent, 1%.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We are guessing here to be honest, but --
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Just, okay --
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: John and I both came up with the same number, probably a percent.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: About 1% in gross margin.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I mean it's not an analytic number, it's a number just from listening to our operations et cetera that's probably about half of that 2% kind of number.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
Alright:
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we do have one remaining question in the queue. [Operator Instructions]. We will go now to Wendy Caplan of Wachovia.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Thanks. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Wendy.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: A Couple of questions, just to give us a sense of the underlying business strength. Could you comment on the incremental margin, the core incremental margin?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure Wendy. Extremely good, it was up almost 40% in the quarter. So, the businesses that we have acquired have just substantially increased the contribution margins from the core business.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And I guess along those lines, John, have you drawn the exercise in terms of working capital percentage, excluding recent acquisitions?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, there are little bit... I have it. Let's see, I have got it. The 20.5% that we gave you excludes the acquisitions this yea. So that's a core business Wendy.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Thanks.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's the core business. There is a little drag on acquisitions we have done, but it's not material to the company.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And the... you said Frank that June well, it was gangbusters. For those of us who may not be sure what gangbusters mean, can you walk through April, May, June and kind of give us some sense of was it 2x of April or May or just that kind of comparison?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I will actually have to dig out the numbers here. Can you guys dig out those numbers? Let's just give her numbers. I don't have it in my head. Give us a second, Wendy. We've got too many piles of paper here. Make sure we get orders. Okay, actually Bill... that's just the end. Orders were April, 224; May, 206; June, 282.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Okay. That's great. And so far in July, would you say we're tracking gangbusters or --
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We're doing well, Wendy.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Alright.

Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Bill. AMETEK had an excellent first quarter. We set records for sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Sales were up 21% to $611.2 million on strong internal growth of 6% and the contributions from acquired businesses. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 8%. Order growth was very strong as well, with total orders up 24% in the quarter, internal growth in orders was excellent at 7%. Operating income was up 29%, driven by the top line growth in operational excellence improvements, resulting in 130 basis points improvement in operating income and margin. Net income was up 30% and diluted earnings per share of $0.62 were up 29%. Cash flow from operations was $77 million, up 39% over the last year's fourth quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with these results, our markets were strong, our strategy of acquiring differentiated businesses is working well, and our focus on operational excellence continues to drive profitability. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. The Electronic Instruments Group had an excellent quarter. Sales were up 20% on strong core growth of 6% and the contributions from the acquisitions of Advanced Industries, B&S Aircraft Parts, Cameca, and California Instruments. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 9%. EIG's operating income was up 27% for the quarter. Operating margins improved 130 basis points to 23.3% as compared to 22% in the first quarter of 2007. Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter, with revenues up 22%, solid internal growth of 5%, and the contributions from the Seacon Phoenix, Hamilton Precision Metals, Umeco, Motion Control Group, and Drake Air acquisitions drove the revenue growth. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 7%. Operating income for the quarter was up 24% and operating margins improved 30 basis points to 17.4% compared with 17.1% in last year's first quarter. In addition to our excellent financial results, we continued to make significant progress in the implementation of our four growth strategies, operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and acquisitions. Operational excellence is the corner stone strategy for the company and our reluctantless focused on cost and asset management has been a key driver to both our competitive and financial success. This quarter was no exception as we dramatically improved operating margins by 120 basis points to 19%. While there are many factors contributing to this improvement operational excellence was clearly a driver to our strong operating results. At each business unit AMETEK colleagues are implementing initiatives to improve plant productivity and quality, reduced costs, and increased capital efficiency. In addition to this business unit level activities there are some companywide initiatives that are driving significant financial benefits. Our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives are expected to be a key driver to increase profitability in 2008. We expect to generate $16 million in incremental savings this year from these activities in the first quarter we realized $4.5 million. In 2008, we are continuing our migration to best costs manufacturing locales, Reynosa Mexico, Shanghai, and the Czech Republic. Revenues from these plants was expected to totaled $365 million to $375 million in 2008, an increase of $40 million to $50 million from 2007. In the first quarter revenue from our best-cost facilities was $92 million, an increase of 14% over the first quarter of 2007. Global market expansion continues to be a driver for AMETEX's growth. In the first quarter international sales grew by 24%, and were 51% of our total sales. This growth was driven by demand for our process, aerospace, power, and electromechanical products. In 2006, we took an additional sales on marketing expansion to help fuel our internal growth, including new sub-sales offices in Shanghai, China and Moscow. These investments are paying off an higher sales and increased penetration of these growing markets. Our sales office in Moscow recorded a 33% in sales to Russia in the CIS region in the last year. We've recently doubled the size of our staff in this office to support our growth in this key geography. To support the international growth of our MRO business we hope in new facilities one in Singapore and the other in Paris. These facilities are critical to our ability to service global customers and to expand our MRO platform. We are also very excited about the upcoming opening of AMETEK Commercial Enterprise Shanghai or ACES, our sales service and demonstration center. ACES will give us a first-class customer demonstration facility, exhibiting the whole range of AMETEK's instrument offerings. It also gives AMETEK the ability to drive service revenue growth in China by offering these services to our customers rather than relying on third parties. We believe that ACES will be a key element in our plan to drive higher revenue from China. In the first quarter, our China revenue was up 22%. Another key area of internal growth is new product development. We've consistently invested in RD&. This year the total was expected to be $150 million, up 12% over the last year. Internal growth reflecting a continued strong level of funding, and attraction from our designed Six Sigma efforts was a strong 6% overall in the quarter. While no single new product is significant to AMETEK as a whole, we are excited about some recent introductions. Cameca's new Shallow Probe technology has been embraced by two large semiconductor manufacturers with more customers wins expected. Our Aerospace division won contracts to supply bus adapter units, on the linear C27 aircraft and a C5 Retrofit program. These contracts had the total value of $6 million over the life of the multi-year program. Our HCC business booked an $8.5 million order from the defense contractor for electrical interconnects to be used in the next generation IED detection technology, potential over the next several years for this product to be substantial. Our Hamilton Precession Metals business booked $1 million plus contract, for a very thin stainless steel metal strip with an altered smooth surface finish that would be used for solar panel substrates. From an overall perspective, revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 16% of sales, reflecting the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. Turning to acquisitions, we've acquired four companies this year, representing more than $120 million in annualized revenue. These are all differentiated businesses that expand our market positions in aerospace MRO, technical motors and engineered materials. In the first quarter, we acquired Newage, Drake Air and Motion Control Group. Newage was a technology acquisition, which added materials hardness testing capability. Drake air is at Tulsa, Oklahoma based provider of heat transfer repair services to the commercial aerospace industry with expected annual sales of $15 million. This acquisition represents a further expansion of AMETEK's growing presence in a global aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul services industry. Drake, coupled with AMETEK's recent acquisitions of Umeco repair and overhaul, Southern Aeroparts and B&S Aircraft Parts expands our global MRO platform. Drake extends our MRO capabilities to the thermal management segment of the aerospace market by providing FAA-approved repair services for these products. With this acquisition, our aerospace MRO platform has revenues in excess of $100 million. The third acquisition with Motion Control Group, are leading global manufacture of highly customized motors and motion control solutions for the medical, life sciences, automation, semiconductor and aviation markets. With annual sales of $26 million, MCG is an excellent strategic fit with our highly differentiated technical motor business sharing common market's customers, distribution channels, and motor platforms. Finally, last week we announced the acquisition of Reading Alloys, a privately held, niche, specialty metals producer, with annual sales of approximately $80 million, Reading is a global leader and specialty titanium master alloys and highly engineered metal powders used in the aerospace, medical implant, military, and electronic markets. Reading's titanium master alloys are experiencing outstanding growth, driven by increasing demand for titanium in the commercial aerospace, military aerospace, and power generation markets. 80% of Reading sales are in aerospace and defense applications. The pipeline of acquisition candidates remains strong, and we continued to look to add differentiated business to AMETEK. We have the financial and managerial capacity to continue to do acquisitions and believe this will be a great environment for AMETEK. There is much concerned among investors about the slowing U.S economy. To-date, we have seen only minimal impacts to our business. Our diversified global customer base, significant exposure long-cycle markets, a lack of presence in certain very weak areas of the U.S economy, and our operational excellence capabilities provide AMETEK and U.S investors with the buffer against an economic slowdown. Some key points, our customer base is global with 51% of our sales outside the U.S up from 32% in 2001. The international markets are doing extremely well now. We have significant revenue, approximately $750 million concentrated in the long-cycle aerospace and power markets. From all market indications, these businesses should enjoy a number of years of solid growth. In addition, it should be noted that these long-cycle businesses have higher than average profitability. We have minimal exposure to the residential housing and automotive markets to particularly weak areas of the U.S economy. Also when necessary, we will react swiftly to align our cost base with economic realities. This capability enabled us to improve markets... markets throughout the last downturn one of the first industrial companies to do so. In addition, as a precautionary measure we included general belt tightening improvements, in our 2008 budget. Pulling all this together, only about 25% of our sales and a smaller amount of our profitability are exposed to the short cycle U.S economy. Our higher profit, long cycle businesses should continue to perform well in an economic downturn, and when needed, we have the ability to react swiftly to properly size our operations to continue our strong profitability. Turing to the outlook for 2008, we are very optimistic about out prospects for the balance of 2008, and are increasing our guidance for the year. All of our key markets are strong. For the year revenue is estimated to increase in the high-teens on a percentage basis on mid single-digit core growth in each group, and the annualized impact of acquisitions. Internal growth of the Electronic Instruments Group will benefit from continued strengths in our aerospace, power, and process businesses. In the Electromechanical Group, the core growth will be driven by strong performance in our differentiated businesses. The full year impact of our 2007 acquisitions, as well as the impact of the acquisitions we have completed to-date in 2008 will also be a key contributor to the top line growth. Earnings are expected to be approximately $2.47 to $2.52 per diluted share, an increase of 17% to 19% over the 2007 level of $2.12 per diluted share. For the second quarter of 2008 sales are expected to be up in the high-teens, on a percentage basis from last year's second quarter, we estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.61 to $0.63 per diluted share, an increase of 13% to 17% over last year's first quarter of $0.54 per diluted share. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter, solid internal growth and the contributions from acquired businesses enabled us to grow the top line by 21%. We've been able to translate the top line growth into bottom line performance, driving significant margin expansion and strong net income and earnings per share growth. 2008 is shaping up to be another great year. All of our key markets are strong. Our operational excellence capabilities, global customer base, exposure to long-cycle aerospace and power markets, and the impact of our recent acquisitions should enable us to growth both the top and bottom lines and meet our earnings estimates even as the U.S economy slows. The pipeline of acquisition candidates remained strong and we continue to look to add additional differentiated businesses to AMETEK. We look forward to building on our track record of success during 2008, and remain confident that our four growth strategies will continue to create value for our shareholders. John will now cover some of the financial details, and then we will be happy to take your questions.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Frank. Results we are reporting today demonstrate a continuing high quality of earnings, strong margin growth and a balance sheet well equipped to support our growth plans. As Frank has covered our results at a high level, I will focus on some particular areas of interest. Selling expenses were up 22% in the first quarter essentially unchanged as a percent of sales. Excluding acquisitions, selling expense increased in line with our core growth. Corporate G&A expense for the first quarter was roughly flat on an absolute basis when compared to last year's first quarter and fell to 1.6% of sales as compared to 2% in last year's first quarter. We expect G&A spend for the full year to be about the same as 2007. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.9%. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2008 to be approximately 32.5 to 33%. As we have said before this is a full year rate and actual quarterly rates can differ dramatically either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet, working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables was 21% of sales for the first quarter, essentially unchanged from last year's first quarter. We continue to see an opportunity to reduce our working capital investment. Our plans are to reduce this overall percentage in 2008. Capital spending was $9 million for the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $14 million in the quarter. For 2008, we expect that capital expenditures will total approximately $50 million, while depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $60 million. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was superb and totaled $77 million, up 39% over the first quarter of 2007. We expect operating cash flow for the company to be roughly $335 million for the full year, up about 20% from last year. In January, the Board approved an increase to the authorized level for stock repurchases, adding $50 million to be approximately $26 million that remained under previous Board authorization. In keeping with our strategy of opportunistically, repurchasing common stock to offset the dilutive impact of our benefit plans. During the first quarter we expanded $43.5 million, repurchasing $1 million shares of our common stock. At March 31st, approximately $32.4 million remained available under this Board authorization. Total debt was $904 million at March 31st, unchanged from December 31st. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $150 million resulting a net debt-to-capital ratio at quarter-end of approximately 38%, up slightly from 37% at the end of 2007. These ratios reflect the investment of $75 million in acquisitions, and repurchase of $43.5 million of common stock noted above. At the end of March, we had approximately $633 million available under our short-term credit lines. In summary, we continue to manage our cost structure and balance sheet effectively, generating excellent cash flow and positioning ourselves for future growth. Bill.
William J. Burke - Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer: That concludes our prepared remarks. Jessica, we'll be happy to take questions now. Question And Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jim Lucas from Janney.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Hi, thanks, good morning guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jim.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Frank, well actually, let me start first with John, payables number in the quarter?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure Jim, $237 million.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: All right, thanks. And, Frank, two question. With the MRO business, as you mentioned the two new offices internationally, could you comment from an acquisition standpoint as you've been building out that business, it's been more domestic to begin with, are their equal opportunities from a consolidation standpoint on the international front? And then somewhat related to that, could you just speak to what you are seeing in the acquisition environment in general, particularly with the multiples that are... that you are seeing out there?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, starting with the MRO business, Jim there is definite opportunities in Europe to do the type of consolidations that we are talking about and are doing in the U.S. You may recall that we acquired Umeco, which was a large MRO operation in Europe, and we see good opportunities to extend that platform by adding more companies to it. In Asia, the acquisition environmental for acquisitions in general I would say in our space, as well as specifically in the MRO business are not a strong and that's in essence why we decided to start our own operation in Singapore. We think there is significant leverage in terms of servicing that market, but the strategy there will be much more internally driven then acquisition driven. In terms of the overall acquisition environment, it's extremely good right now. We've definitely done a lot already in the first three to four months of the year with over $120 million and annual sales acquired, our backlog is strong. And I would say in terms of the pricing Jim, it's a little bit of mixed bag right now. We are still seeing on some acquisitions pricing that is very high, and I think it's somewhat historical from the view point... of the sellers view point if they were getting used to higher multiples then have not decided to come down yet. On the other side of the coin, we are also seeing on some deals the pricing come down, and if you look at what we've done in the first four months of the year we are averaging sub eight times EBITDA on the deals that we have done. So I would say for those deals we are down a bit from what we had done of sale over the previous 18 months to that. My expectations are that we are going to see the multiples come down, and hopefully we will be back to more normalized levels in the next six to nine months.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: And to your point on the bifurcated multiples that you are seeing out there I mean, I guess just take it one step further, is it any particular type of deals sellers, is it private expectations versus companies of private equity looking to perhaps raise some funds.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Right it's really hard for me to put any further clarification on that. It just seems to be somewhat sporadic right now Jim. And I think that's probably not that a typical as to where we are in the cycle.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: All right, thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: See you back, Jim.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Baliotti with FTN Midwest.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities Corp: Hi, good morning
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hello, John.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities Corp: All right, guys. John could you maybe just go over receivables inventory a little bit I mean the quarter was obviously very strong and I am just expecting that maybe some of the inventories and so on of receivables just could be factored based on core growth and acquisitions is that fair?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure let me give you some perspectives there. Inventories are up about 6% when you extract the effective acquisitions. So it's clearly in line with the way the company is growing, and our receivables are up 7% also in line with the growth of the company. And our metrics there are acceptable, but 61 days on days outstanding on receivables down slightly from a year ago, and turns were about 4.6 turns, and that's really the effect of the acquisitions in the last six to 12 months of... I have taken that metric down slightly, but we've got some plans to improve that in the near term.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities Corp: Okay. So in general underlying, everything is tracking pretty well, it just the obvious, short-term impact that is taken on the balance sheet of the acquired companies?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. And the internal growth, and plus you've got some currency effect John.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities Corp: Right.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The euro inventories are coming to the balance sheet that are much higher dollar level may were a year ago.
John Baliotti - FTN Midwest Securities Corp: Right. Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet, John.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks a lot. Congratulation on a good quarter, guys. I'm just trying to better understand the 2008 guidance here. It looks like Q1 was about $0.10 ahead of the mid-point of your prior guidance, but you're rising the full year '08 by about $0.07, some guess, the way I'm looking at it implicatively. You are really lowering about $0.03 of the remainder three quarter in 2008. Is that the correct way to look at it, or am I missing something?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, you are missing something. The first quarter was about a nickel above.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, in our guidance was 56 to 58, we came in at 62, so we are about a nickel above the mid-point for the first quarter.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Got it, all right. And then just from an acquisition perspective, could you just talk about, you have done obviously quite a few deals during the last three, four months. Is the focus mode just kind of back, you know, take a step back in terms of doing further deals, and integrating the once we already have done?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No actually, we do not. We view a slowing economy as an opportunity to become more aggressive on acquisitions. You may recall that last year, we substantially increased the M&A capability in the company so that we would be able to take on more acquisitions, and in fact we have now proven that we can do three or four deals simultaneously and our ability to integrate them are very, very comfortable with, as we grow the company we've been increasing, the operating management in the company significantly, and since, we've got a lot of appendages in terms of different business units and different acquisition, or different divisions. We are able to bring them on, and integrate them without significant difficulty. What we won't do is bring multiple acquisitions into the same business unit area, and because we've got enough different parts of the company, we just don't see that as a problem make continuing aggressiveness that we've shown in the first four months.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Fair enough. And just finally, Frank, I think you have already talked about a new program that you guys won on the county measurement IED product line. I think six, seven quarters ago, you guys were providing cooling fans of comparable product, is this just a resurrection of the old one, or is this a new one or its in the revenue stream?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: This is a totally different technology and a different approach, and it's actually used to find IDs in the ground. So it is more of an infra red type technology. And I can't speak to the particulars of the program in any more detail than that, but obviously the whole IED environment is the most significant issue that we're having in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the military is just looking for significant technology to be brought to bare to those issues and this most recent contract that I mentioned is just another foray into that activity.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: All right. Thanks a lot.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We now will take a question from Wendy Caplan from Wachovia.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Wendy.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: A couple of things, first you mentioned a belt tightening in '08. Can you talk... give us some color on that in terms of what exactly you are doing and what you expect to spend this year?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, as part of the budgeting process, Wendy, we decided as I mention in my opening remarks to do some belt tightening. It totals about $5 million in terms of the benefit that we expect in 2008 due to those belt tightening measurements. And they include things like the closure of some plants predominantly in the United States, basically looking at areas and SG&A, you may have noticed that our SG&A was very, very good for the quarter, so we just decided to take some actions on the SG&A to keep it in more in line with what we see might be happening in the U.S economy. The cost to do this, I don't actually remember the number, but they were not substantial, it was less than $1 million to make that happen.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Thank you. And the incremental margin in your core businesses this past quarter?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it was just excellent. We were greater than 40% in the contribution margin in the first quarter.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: And is it fair Frank to say that, in terms of margin going forward that there is no reason why we shouldn't see margin expand in your two segments?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think as we go forward there are still the opportunity to continue to increase margins, I see no reason why it isn't going to happen in both segments. One thing you should recognize is that, a number of the acquisitions we brought on this year are in EMG. So there will be a little bit of dilutive impact in EMG due to those acquisitions, but still we believe we're going to expand margins as the year goes on, essentially offsetting that dilutive impact.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Great. Thank you. And finally you mention that you have core order growth in the quarter of 7%?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That's correct.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Was that excluding currency?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that's excluding currency.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Okay. And is there any anything particular that was in there... any large contracts or anything that would be out of the ordinary?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I would say it was fairly normal. I mean we did get a couple of contracts in aerospace of $7 million or $8 million, but that's very typical.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Securities: Okay. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: We'll take a question from Scott Graham with Bear Stearns.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Scott, are you there?
Operator: Mr. Graham your line is open. [Operator Instructions]. Okay, we will move to Richard Eastman with Robert Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Yes, couple of questions Frank, when we look at the EIG piece of the business with a core growth of 6%. Could we just walk through the four pieces there and what was perhaps above that and what may have been below that?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure, let's start with aerospace. Aerospace was in essence well above it, we had low double-digit growth in the aerospace part of EIG. The process businesses were above at that rate, mid single-digits. And power and industrial, the combination of both of those was above that level maybe just slightly below. And in essence if you look at the breakdown between power and industrial, power was up, low double-digits and industrial was flat as we had anticipated. The heavy truck market were continue to be down in the first quarter. Although, we are expecting that's going to improve substantially as the year goes on. And in fact the power and industrial segment for the remainder of the year, actually for the full year even including the first quarter, we are expecting to be up high single-digits in terms of organic growth.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Okay. And I guess maybe I am sensing a little more optimism there from a core growth ratestandpoint, then we heard, say at the end of the fourth quarter overall?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, I'm feeling actually much more comfortable right now than I did at the beginning of the year, because I didn't exactly know what the impacts of the economy were going to be. And now that we're a quarter in and we've had obviously an excellent quarter, and we've really pulled our operating units to see if we could find any substantial areas of weakness and we simply can't find those, I'm pretty optimistic, so you're probably hearing that in my tone and in my voice, and I am feeling better, no question about that.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: And, so... again when I look at the sales guidance for the full year up high-teens, the Q1 flurry of acquisitions that you did, pretty much put us there, so are we still... again kind of staying reasonably conservative on the core growth rate with some upside there?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, no question.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Right.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: The numbers we've given you are on the conservative side and we would expect to beat them.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: And just a last question, could you just talk to raw material cost and pricing, and the variance that you're seeing, has that changed during the quarter... in the first quarter?
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: It's moving around, no question about it, but let me start by saying and I think you've heard this from me, before that in essence, we're relatively impervious to what happens on that, the commodity price increase. We do an excellent job of passing the cost of commodity, material increases onto our customers and also rebalancing and buying the materials from different parts of the world. So that in essence, it's not a major factor to our bottom line. If I'd like to sort of walk through the materials, copper has tended to go up, it's approaching $4 up right now, and it probably was more at 350 roughly at the beginning of the year, I'm not sure, I'm exactly right on that, but it's in that ballpark. Steel which started to show some improvements last year has gone up a bit again, and let see the other commodity would be nickel and nickel has actually come down that's gone the other way. Nickel at the end of last year say the third and fourth quarter, were up above $20 a pound, and it's now floating down in the $13 a pound region. So it's been sort of a mixed bag as to whether they are going up or whether they're going down, but again in terms of our profitability it's been a very minor factor.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: So with all the puts and takes at the gross profit line, has pricing been a positive for you?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, pricing has been definitely a positive. We are up in 1% to 2% area in the quarter.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: For sales, okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Up sales.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, sir.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll now go to Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Good morning. Couple of questions first just with respect to EIG I think operating margins in the quarter set a new record if I remember correctly. Can you talk about the... if there is anything going on as far product mix if that type of margin run rate I guess Frank is sustainable.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we don't see any reason Matt why that would not be sustainable, and it basically is driven by a couple of things. One is the fact that we've really changed the diversification of that business to much more highly technology driven businesses, and as we do that the profit margins in those businesses are higher than the norm and the margins keep incrementing up. The second thing is the operational excellence activities of the operating managers in that group have been nothing short of superlative. They just continue to... they really do a great job of managing their cost structure. So I think the biggest detriment to margins will be if the economy does in fact weaken and the internal growth, it doesn't stay up in that 6%, 7% kind of region and that will have an impact overtime, but we're simply not seeing that now, nor do I anticipate it for the rest of this year.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Sticking with EIG, if you look at just the process group of business, do you have a geographic breakdown, in terms of how much of that is U.S versus non-U.S? And then can you talk about the momentum you're seeing again in your domestic process group of businesses versus non-U.S?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Right, Bill is looking it up, but I'll give you my of the top thought process here, I think it's about 65% outside the United States for those process businesses. There is a difference between the growth rates outside the U.S, and those inside the U.S, there is a lot of new plant construction going on outside the U.S in both, the far East, as well as in Russia, and the CIS states, and as you know, we put a sales office in Moscow to capitalize on that, and we're seeing that as we speak. We have a very, very strong performance there. In the U.S it's more of a replacement business, so the grow rates are quite as high, although they are very good. So it's a great area to be in right now, and obviously the price of oil at $117 a barrel was not a detriment to the growth.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: And then just a last question with respect to EMG, can you do a little bit of a walk through in terms of the core grow rate you saw across the different businesses there?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Did you say EMG?
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Yes, please.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay, sure. Well, if we look at total EMG, sales were up 22% in the quarter, and as I indicated organic growth was 5%, 7% of currencies included. So if we look at the two parts of that business, the differentiated part of EMG continues to be very, very strong. It's actually now 72% of EMG sales are in differentiated businesses, so this sort of a change that we've made across the entire company is really becoming significant now in the Electromechanical Group as well. The aerospace and defense related businesses were very, very strong in the quarter. Q1 internal growth was up high single-digits in the differentiated part. Total growth with acquisitions was up approximately 30%, so very strong performance. And we see no reason why we're not going to have good performance as the year goes on. If we look at cost driven motors that was doing fine basically in the first quarter, the growth was flat as anticipated. And I think you are well aware that we've run that business from maximum profitability versus growth. We've been continuing to move production to low cost locales. And we have a strong focus on lean and efficient manufacturing. I think you've heard some of my metrics in the opening talk where we basically expect to have $40 million to $50 million more of sales in these low cost regions during the year, and also some very, very strong performance in the sourcing area. And as result for this cost driven segment, we expect profits to be up double-digits for the year. So we're expecting of another very, very good year in cost driven motors, although not obviously with the same organic growth we see in the differentiated part of the business.
Matthew Summerville - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Great. Thanks a lot.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: You bet, Matt.
Operator: We'll now go to Ned Armstrong with FBR.
Ned Armstrong - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you, good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning, Ned.
Ned Armstrong - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.: I believe I heard you, when you were going through your acquisitions that the one motion control serve the medical market, is that a greater area, focusing your acquisition targeting now, or is that just more happened be coincidental that you did that the deal flowed your way?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, that's definitely a desire, on our part strategically, to move our businesses within, basically in the instrument and the motor side of the business to have a higher concentration in both, medical instrumentation and electromechanical devices for the medical markets, also pharmaceutical not just medical, it's really the combination of both of those. Our chip division already had fairly sizeable concentration in the medical environment, and when we saw MCG available in the market, it's just a perfect fit, which had been a further expands the concentration of our business into that arena. So we are going to continue to expand up.
Ned Armstrong - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.: Are you saying in the pharmaceutical medical markets are propositionally the same number of opportunities that you maybe saying in some of your more core traditional markets?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I would say I am not seeing as many, in the medical environment as I am seeing in the more of the core businesses.
Ned Armstrong - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We were, but we were not.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take a follow-up question from Jim Lucas with Janney.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: All right. Thanks. Frank, your aerospace business now, could you bring us up-to-date on what the mix is there when you put the EMG and EIG exposure of...
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Commercial etc.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, the mix is commercial is about 50%, military is about 35%, and business in regional aircraft is now about 15%. So there has been a shift in the dynamics of that business, resulting from several things. First, is super growth in the commercial side had made it a larger piece of the business. And secondly, some of the acquisitions we have done have favored more commercial and military than business in regional aircraft.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: And within that both commercial and military, the '08 versus after-market?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: If you look at the total business now across AMETEK, it's a about 45% MRO, and of that 45%, about half is third-arty MRO and about half is MRO work we do on our OEM products, if that make sense.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Yes. And within military still weighted much more towards the helo versus flying fan [ph]?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would say the growth is definitely very, very good in the helo side. The overall business, I would say is not weighted that way, it's probably weighted more the other way, but in terms of growth, yes.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay. And back in your prepared remarks you had talked about roughly 25% of sales short-cycle?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Besides the cost driven motors what else would be included in that?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well if you look at some of our instrument businesses for instance, we have a division, U.S gauge that's involved in our gauges that costs $, $2 each, and those businesses we would include in that also. Actually the tip division, we were just talking about a few moments ago, as largely... U.S concentration and largely tends to be in that arena.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: And finally given the very busy last couple of years you've had on the acquisition front and most recently. Any surprises positive, negative on the integration of the more recent deals?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, I would say it's going pretty much to plan, I... if I step back we've been very, very fortunate and I think it really relates to the operational excellence culture that's embedded in AMETEK. Our division managers are able to take these acquisitions and integrate them etcetera. John is smiling a little bit here next to me because he and I used to be so engrained in every deal that we do, and we no longer have to be because in essence, the operating management in the company is strong enough that they are able to bring them in, and as they gain experience in doing these acquisitions the second or third time they do them, obviously they are much better than the first time, so it's... it's going on pretty good. John, you want to add some thing.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Jim, you probably heard us say this before that we vigorously track our acquisitions performance through the first year to their birthday, sort to speak with AMETEK, I do that for all of our acquisitions and their spot on just to take and I'll look at some of the ones that will close out in the second quarter of this year, and their spot on in terms of what we projected and with the slight upside bias, so we are in the aggregate, very, very comfortable with the performance of our acquisitions.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Well if you are getting John to smiling, you must be doing something right. Thanks a lot.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: All right, Jim.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Richard Eastman with Robert Baird.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Frank, could you just talk for a second or two about the percentage of AMETEK sales that are too export driven and by that I mean U.S to international markets. And is that... is that business first of all is it sized, so that it can be meaningful, and secondly is it... has it responded to the weaker dollar?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I... these guys are looking up the numbers, but I think it's around 30%, is the right number that will be considered export sales, and yes, obviously the currency is impacting us, actually it's probably impacting us more here in the positive way than the way all of our peer companies and us talk about the external members because you have got a sizeable pricing advantage because of particularly in Europe because of where the euro is right now, it's very, very difficult to quantify... very difficult to quantify how much of the increase in sales is due to new products, how much is due to few... basically the increase in the distribution networks that we're putting in place, and how much is due to this pricing advantage. But, it's there, there is absolutely no question about it.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Andis it presumably it would favor given the mix... it would favor aerospace in the process instrument side of the business?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, very heavily the process side because that has a more significant impact on what we call export sales. Now, there is something sort of hidden below the numbers here in that, good part of our for instance production that we give to Boeing, we call that U.S business, we are in fact that a lot of that ends of outside the United States, when it's... put in plains, and we don't have a really an accurate breakdown of that.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Okay. Okay. It's just... in its 30% of total sales?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: ProbablyRick, I'll have to get back to you about what we... the total export sales, when we have that number with us, we will get back to you.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.Let's, that's my gut is, but I could be off some.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc: I got you. Okay. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: And there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to you Mr. Burke for additional or closing remarks.

Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Bill. AMETEK had an excellent fourth quarter. We set records for sales, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Sales were up 21% to $583.3 million on strong internal growth of 7% and the contributions from acquired businesses. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 10%. Order growth was very strong as well, with total orders up 26% in the quarter, internal growth in orders with excellent at 12%. Operating income was up 31%, driven by the topline growth in operational excellence improvements, resulting in 130 basis points improvement in operating income and margin. Net income was up 29% and diluted earnings per share of $0.57 were up 27%. Cash flow from operations was $97 million, up 48% over the last year’s fourth quarter. For the full year, our performance was also excellent. Sales were up 17% to $2.14 billion. Operating income was up 25% and operating margins expanded 110 basis points. Net income was up 25% and diluted earnings per share were $2.12, up 24% over 2006. Excellent internal growth in each of our segments and contributions from acquired businesses enabled us to post this sharp sales increase. Our operating leverage and improved mix of businesses and our focused operation excellence initiatives drove our record earnings performance. Cash flow from operations for the year was $279 million, up 23% from last year’s level of $226 million. Overall, we are very pleased with these results, our markets are strong, our strategy of acquiring differentiated businesses is working well, and our focus on operational excellence continues to drive profitability. Turning our attention to the individual operating groups. Electronic Instruments Group had an excellent quarter. Sales were up 23% on strong core growth of 8% and the contributions from the acquisitions of Precitech, Advanced Industries, B&S Aircraft Parts, and Cameca. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 11%. EIG’s operating income was up 37% for the quarter, so a super quarter. Operating margins improved 230 basis points to 21.8% as compared to 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2006. For the year, EIG sales were up 18%, driven by growth in our process, aerospace and power businesses and the contributions from acquisitions. For 2007, EIG operating income was up… was $260.3 million, an increase of 28% over the last year, operating margins were up 170 basis points to 21.7%. Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter, with revenues up 19%, solid internal growth of 6%, and the contributions from the Southern Aeroparts, Seacon Phoenix, Hamilton Precision Metals and Umeco acquisitions drove the revenue growth. If the effects of foreign currency are included, internal growth was 9%. Operating income for the quarter was up 21% and operating margins improved 30 basis points to 17.2% compared with 16.9% in last year’s fourth quarter. For the full year EMG sales were up 17%, strong growth in our differentiated businesses and the contributions from acquisitions drove the sales increase. Operating income was up 19% from 2006 and operating margins increased 40 basis points to 17.8%. We are obviously very pleased with our financial results in 2007. We are equally pleased with the progress we have made in fathering our strategic initiatives and how that success has positioned AMETEK for continued strong, profitable growth in 2008 and beyond. We have made sustainable progress in the implementation of our four growth strategies, acquisitions, operational excellence, global and market expansion and new product development and I would like to review each of those. In the acquisition arena, we acquired seven companies in 2007, including two in the fourth quarter. Together these seven businesses represent approximately $230 million in annualized revenue. These were all differentiated businesses that expanded our market positions in the analytic instrumentation, aerospace, power and engineered materials, and interconnect markets. The fourth quarter acquisitions were uniquely repaired on overhaul in California Instruments. You need to repair an overhaul with sales of approximately $57 million is the largest independent U.K. provider of third party maintenance repair and overhaul services for the commercial aerospace industry. This is a great acquisition for us, as it continues our expansion in third party MRO services, gives us a strong presence in the European MRO market and greatly expands the range of products and airframe platforms that we are now able to support. This acquisition coupled with our recent acquisitions of Southern Aeroparts and B&S Aircraft Parts establishes a global MRO platform for AMETEK. Second acquisition in the fourth quarter was California Instruments which we acquired in December. California Instruments with annual sales of $22 million is a global leader in programmable AC power sources used to test electrical and electronic products. These products are used in design verification testing, manufacturing, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance by its customers in the computer, consumer electronics, industrial controls, aerospace and defense industries. This acquisition broad us the scope of our power instruments business, which produces power quality monitoring and metering instrumentation and further expands our presence in the attractive electronic test and measurement equipment markets. Additionally, in August, we acquired Cameca, a highly differentiated manufacturer of high-end elemental analysis systems, used in advanced laboratory research, semiconductor, and nano technology applications, with annual sales of $80 million. In June, we acquired Hamilton Precision Metals, the niche specialty metals producer of precision metal strip and foil, for medical, electronic, and instrumentation markets with annual sales of $25 million. And also in June, we acquired two aerospace businesses, Advanced Industries and B&S Aircraft Parts. Advanced Industries manufactures starter generators, brush and brushless motors, vane-axial and centrifugal blowers and linear actuators for the business jet, light jet, and helicopter markets. B&S Aircraft Parts and accessories provide third party MRO services, primarily for starter generators and hydraulic and fuel system components for a variety of business aircraft and helicopter applications. Together these businesses have combined annual revenue of approximately $25 million. And lastly, in April, we acquired Seacon Phoenix a privately held provider of undersea electrical interconnect subsystems for the global submarine market, with sales of $17 million. The pipeline of acquisition candidates remains strong, and we continue to look at additional differentiated businesses to AMETEK. We have the financial and managerial capability to continue to do acquisitions and we will become more aggressive in a slowing economy. As you know, we do not include potential future acquisitions in our guidance. Operational excellence was also a significant contributor to AMETEK's success in 2007. Our global sourcing office and strategic procurement initiatives were key drivers to increase profitability in 2007. We generated $11 million in savings in 2007, and expect an additional $16 million in incremental savings in 2008. We strengthen and continued our migration to best cost manufacturing locales in 2007. Revenue from Reynosa Mexico, Shanghai and Czech Republic plants totaled $326 million, an increase of $40 million from 2006, an increased production of cost driven motor products as well as aerospace products. In addition, we moved $5 million in revenue from Reynosa to Shanghai. We will continue to move products to these best cost facilities and expect revenues from these facilities to be up another $40 million to $50 million in 2008. As a result of these actions and many others throughout our divisions, we are able again expand operating margins this year by 110 basis points. Global market expansion continues to be a key driver for AMETEX’s growth. In 2007, international sales grew by 22%. This growth was balanced across geographies, driven by demand for our process, aerospace, power and electromechanical products. Acquisitions also paid a key role in this international growth, with Land Instruments, Southern Aeroparts and Umeco providing a boost to international growth. Our investments in Russia, Japan, and in the Middle East made in 2006 also contributed nicely to our international expansion. Our final growth strategy and key revenue for growth is new product development, we have consistently invested RD&E. This year the total is $103 million, up 17% over last year. Internal growth, reflecting a continued strong level of funding and attraction from our design for Six Sigma efforts was a strong 7% in 2007 and nearly 9% for the differentiated businesses. Revenue from products introduced over the last three years was 18% of sales, demonstrating the excellent work of our businesses in developing the right products to serve their customers. There is much discussion in the press and with investors about the slowing U.S. economy. Although, you have not seen any meaningful impact on our business, we feel we are well positioned when and if our business is affected. This is based on a diversified global customer base, our exposure to long cycle markets, a lack of presence in certain very weak areas of the U.S. economy, and our operational excellence capabilities. Some key points. Our customer base is global, with 50% of our sales outside the U.S., up from 32% in 2001. The international markets are doing extremely well. We have significant revenue, approximately $675 million concentrated in the long cycle aerospace and power markets from all market indications, these businesses should enjoy a number of years of solid growth. In addition, it should be noted that these long cycle businesses have higher than average profitability. We have minimal exposure to the residential housing and automotive markets two particularly weaker areas of the U.S. economy. Also, when necessary, we were react swiftly to align our cost base with economic realities. This capability enabled us to improve margins throughout the last downturn, one of the few industrial companies to do so. In addition, as a precautionary measure, we have included general belt tightening improvements in our 2008 budget. Pulling all of this together only about 25% of our sales and a smaller amount of our profitability are exposed to the short cycle U.S. economy. Our higher profit long cycle businesses will continue to do well in an economic downturn, and when needed, we will react swiftly to properly size our operations and continue our strong profitability. Turning to the outlook for 2008. We are very optimistic about our prospects for 2008. All of our key markets are strong. For the year, revenue is estimated to increase in the low double digit on a percentage basis on mid single core growth in each group and an annualized impact of acquisitions. Electronic Instrument internal growth will benefit from continued strength in our aerospace, power, and process business. In the Electromechanical Group, the core growth will be driven by strong performance in our differentiated businesses. The full year impact of our 2007 acquisitions will also be a key contributor to the topline growth. Earnings are expected to be approximately $2.40 to $2.45 per diluted share, an increase of 13% to 16% over the 2007 level of $2.12 per diluted share. For the first quarter of 2008, sales are expected to be up in the high teens on a percentage basis from last year’s first quarter. We estimate our earnings to be approximately $0.56 to $0.58 per diluted share, an increase of 17% to 21% over last year’s first quarter of $0.48 per diluted share. So, in summary, we are extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and the full year. Solid internal growth and the contributions from acquired businesses enabled us to grow the top line by 17% for the year. We’ve been able to translate the top line growth into bottom line performance, driving significant margin expansion and strong net income and earnings per share growth. And 2008 is shaping to be another great year. All of our key markets are strong. Our operational excellence capabilities, global customer base, exposure top long cycle aerospace and power markets and the full year impact of acquisitions completed in 2007 should enable us to grow both the top and bottom lines and meet our earnings estimates even as the U.S. economy slows. The pipeline of acquisition candidates remained strong and we continue to look to add additional differentiated businesses to AMETEK. We are very confident that 2008 will be another great year. We look forward to building on our track record of success during 2008, and remain confident that our four growth strategies will continue to create value for our shareholders. John will now cover some of the financial details and then we’ll be glad to take your questions.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Frank. As Frank has covered our results at a high level, I will provide some additional details on the company’s performance. Compared with the same quarter of a year ago, we drove margin improvement at the group level and increased our operating income margins by 130 basis points. Selling expenses were up 23% in the fourth quarter. Excluding acquisitions, selling expense increased at a rate below our core growth. The acquired businesses tend to have higher selling expenses as a percentage of sales and the base AMETEK businesses due to their differentiated nature. Corporate G&A expense was up on higher costs associated with growing the Company. Year-to-date, corporate G&A expense was 1.9% of sales, the same percentage as a year ago. We expect G&A spend for 2008 to be flat versus 2007. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.7%, and for the full year 2007, the rate was 32.2%. We expect a very similar effective tax rate for the full year of 2008. As we said before, this is a full year rate and actual quarterly rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year rate. On the balance sheet. Working capital to sales, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables was 20.6% for the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged from last year’s fourth quarter. We continue to see an opportunity to reduce our working capital investment. Our plans are to reduce this overall percentage further in 2008 by approximately 1%. Capital spending was $13 million for the quarter and $38 million for the year of 2007. Depreciation and amortization was $15 million for the quarter and $53 million for the year. For 2008, we expect the capital expenditures will total approximately $50 million, while depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $60 million. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was superb and totaled $97 million, up 48% over the fourth quarter of 2006. Full year operating cash flow was $279 million, a 23% increase over the last year. We expect operating cash flow for the Company to be roughly $330 million in 2008, reflecting growth in earnings, better working capital management, and the additional working capital needs of a growing business. During 2007, we expended a significant amount of afford to improve the Company’s capital structure and ensure that adequate liquidity was in place to support our growth plans. In June, we upsized our revolving credit facility from $300 million to $450 million plus an additional $100 million accordion feature. Earlier in May, we increased the size of our account receivables securitization facility by $35 million to $110 million. Finally, on August 30, we closed on a private placement for $450 million in long-term debt. There are two funding date under this private placement. The first occurred in December for a total of $370 million and the second the remaining $80 million will fund in July of 2008. Proceeds from the December funding were used to reduce short-term debt, which eliminated borrowings under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization agreements. The remaining funds are carried in cash on our balance sheet. We intend to use the second funding under the private placement along with cash balances and if necessary, borrowings under our short-term facilities to redeem our 7.2% senior public notes due in July of 2008. This private placement augments an already strong long-term capital structure, and along with our strong cash flow, and availability under our short-term credit facilities will allow us to adequately finance our acquisition strategy, over the next several year, thereby removing the access to the capital markets as a risk to the company. Total debt was $903 million at December 31, an increase of $103 million in the quarter. Offsetting net debt is a cash and marketable securities balance of $181 million. These amounts reflect the funding under the private placement, repayment of short-term debt, higher cash balances, and the investments of $114 million in acquisitions during the quarter. Our net debt to capital ratio at quarter end was 37%, down from 40% at the end of 2006. We were able to de-lever the balance sheet in 2007, while completing more than $300 million in acquisitions. At the end of December, we had approximately $633 million available under our short-term credit lines. In summary, we continue to manage our cost structure and balance sheet effectively, generating excellent cash flow and positioning ourselves for future growth. Bill?
William J. Burke - Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer: That concludes our prepared remarks. Rayne, we would be happy to take questions at this time. Question and Answer
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we have our first question from Jim Lucas with Janney Investment.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Jim.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: First question, John, just a housekeeping here. The ’07 CapEx number again, I missed that and also the payables?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The ’07 payables is $206.2 million, and the ’07 CapEx I said was…
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: $38 million.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: $38 million. Right. $38 million.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay. Thank you. I had missed that. Frank, very positive remarks in your opening commentary. I mean, clearly, the work that’s been done over the last several years is showing up in the reported results. Two questions. When you look at the end-markets, we understand in terms of a lot of the positives that are going on and the commentary regarding the belt tightening, are you seeing any markets showing any signs and deterioration wouldn’t be the right word. But any signs of any potential slowing with that belt tightening is beginning to occur?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No. Not really, Jim. We are really not seeing any of end-markets showing a slowing that would cause us to react significantly. The reason we decided to do some belt tightening is just… as we looked at what was happening in the world, it obviously feels like things are slowing down. So, we could be moving into a recession. And we just wanted to take some precautionary steps. But there’s nothing in the end-markets that is concerning us or that we are seeing, at this point in time. You may recall that last year the only market that was weak for us was heavy vehicles. It was pretty small part of the company was only $20 million exposure and actually that market this year is forecasted to turnaround It went down substantially last year and is forecasted to turnaround. So, in essence, all the markets are in good shape.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: And switching gears on the acquisition side, you went in a couple of new directions in ’07 with your acquisitions. And as you are in the early stages on the integration side, are you seeing anything one way or the other with regards to the acquisitions that’s either more positive or as expected?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would say that, in general, everything is moving ahead just as we had outlined. The one that stands out in terms of extremely positive performance was Precitech. That business did extremely well and far exceeded our targets. But in general, they are doing just fine. We are getting their synergies. We are getting obviously the bottom line results as you can see in our performance. And we are pretty optimistic about 2008 to see further savings and integration synergies occurring and leveraging our profitability.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Okay. And finally, on the aerospace side, looking at the various buckets that you are competing in there from the OEM, military helicopter, could you give us a little commentary on what you are seeing on the aerospace side?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure. I mean, again, all of those markets are very strong. Boeing and Airbus are producing at levels as Cessna on a commercial side. The combine backlog for Boeing and Airbuses is about $750 billion. For 2008, Boeing is expected to be up in terms of production about 10% and Airbus up about 5%. So, very strong performance in the large commercial aircraft market in terms of the business and regional jet market. As you know, Cessna is our largest customer. Their backlog is about $12 billion and they are essentially sold out for the next three years. So, very strong market conditions in that part of our business. And then last is military, and that’s also a very strong. As you know, we decided to invest in helicopters and electronic cooling a number of years ago. And those two markets areas in terms of the DoD budget are performing at a higher level and a higher growth rate than the base DoD budget. And we are enjoying that growth. So, we had excellent performance in 2008, and… excuse me… in 2007 and 2008 looks very strong. Our backlog from the beginning of last year to the end of last year for the Company was up about $150 million. It was actually $151 million is the exact number. About half of that is in aerospace and defense. So, it’s a significant backlog that we are going to be enjoying for the next several years.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: And where did the aero mix end up at the end of the year of that $675 million between OEM, military, and business jet?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it’s interesting mix now, because if you look at it in the way that you are talking about it, it’s 40% for large commercial aircraft, 40% for military, and 20% for business in regional aircraft. If you look at it in terms of after market on a component versus OEM, it’s… for our base business, it’s about 30% of our sort of OEM driven business, is about… is in the after market. However, now with this third party MRO, another 18% is in the third party MRO business. So, it totals in rough numbers almost half of the total aerospace business is in the after market arena.
James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott: Great. Well, thanks and congratulations again.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thanks Jim.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: And our next question will come from Robert LaGaipa with Oppenheimer.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer: Few questions. I guess, one just to circle back on the end-markets. Hopefully, you could provide us with what you usually do. Just looking at your cross end-markets. And in doing so, you already gave us commentary relative to aerospace, we have another aerospace company, related company, materials company report this morning. Now granted they provide materials and they have about a year, year and a half type lead time, but they had mentioned some cautiousness in the channel, especially related to the 787. I was also curious as to about there.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, let’s take your second question first and then I will come back and look through the Company as the share of what we do.
Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer: Sure.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We are not seeing any slowdown in the MRO market either for our MRO market or in essence to the third party repair business that we are seeing. It’s very strong both in the U.S. and internationally. The 787 is not a major factor for us. We have got nice potential revenue on that aircraft, but it’s out in time. It’s not on the short-term. As a matter of fact, we looked at what this recent delay would be on the 787 and how it would impact AMETEK, and it’s roughly $1 million to $1.5 million worth of revenue in 2008. So, it’s just a not a major factor. I could see where a company that has substantial content in terms of their business mix on that aircraft might have a more significant issue, but for us, it simply. It is not a major factor. And actually that $1 million to $1.5 million doesn’t include the fact that the probably more other Boeing and/or Airbus aircraft are going to be shipped because of that delay. So, it will probably be even less than.
Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer: Very good.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: So, let me walk you through the end-markets as I normally do and I’ll try to give you a picture of looking into 2008 as to what we see, sort of coming off of 2007. And I’ll start with EIG. As I mentioned in my opening remarks for that group, sales were up 23% in Q4. Organic growth was 8%, 11% if currency is included. And if we look at the various parts of the business, we have already talked about aerospace in terms of the end markets being strong, so I will not repeat that. Organic growth for aerospace was up double digits in the quarter. Total growth with acquisitions was more than 45%. For 2008, we expect continued strong growth. Internal growth should be high single digits for the year of 2008. In the process business, the markets are very strong, driven obviously by the price of oil. Process and Analytic Instruments division had a great quarter. Materials analysis and ultra precision metrology businesses were also particularly strong in the quarter. New products are doing well. Q4 internal growth was up high single digits. Total growth with acquisitions was up double digits for this part of the business and we expect that good growth to continue. For 2008, internal growth should be up conservatively mid single digits, I think there is a great chance we will do better than that but that’s what’s included in our financial forecast. Power and Industrial. Power and Industrial continues to do well, Q4 was up mid single digits organically and for 2008 we expect Power and Industrial to have high single digit organic growth, so actually an improvement in this part of the business, and that’s driven by the continued strength in Power and the improved market conditions in heavy vehicles. Flipping to the other part of the Company, EMG. As I mentioned in my opening comments, sales were up 19% in the quarter. Organic growth was 6% and 9% if currency is included. The differentiated part of EMG continues to be strong. It is 70% of EMG’s sales, so there is change in the AMETEK portfolio that Jim referred to in his questions, is now a significant part of the EMG part of the business. We are now the fore care [ph] and cost-driven motor part of that business is becoming a smaller and smaller part and that’s driving very strong performance in EMG, overall. In that differentiated part of EMG, our aerospace and defense related businesses were extremely strong in the quarter. Q4 internal growth was up high single digits, total growth with acquisitions was up double digits and we expect that good growth to continue in 2008, and again we are probably a little conservative but we are saying the organic revenues will be up mid single digits. On the cost-driven motor side of the business, that’s doing just fine. Q4 growth was flat. As you are aware we run this business for maximum profitability versus growth. There is continued movement of production to low cost locales including China, Mexico and the Czech republic. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have moved about $40 million to the entire Company, not just cost-driven motors, but that was the largest share of it. We moved about $40 million to these low cost facilities in 2007 and we expect to move another $40 million to $50 million in 2008. Also in this business we focus on lean efficient manufacturing and low cost region sourcing. And I mentioned in my opening remarks that we did about $11 million of cost savings in low cost region sourcing in 2007 and we expect to do about $16 million in 2008, so we have been very aggressive on the cost side of the business. The profit in the quarter for cost-driven motors and for the full year was up double digits. And for 2008, sales are expected to be in that low single digit of flat arena, but again profits are expected to be up double digits. So, overall we are feeling quite positive right now. As I mentioned organic growth in orders in Q4 was 12%, backlog is up $150 million, total backlog is $688 million, as we go into the year. So, we are pretty bullish.
Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer: Terrific and last question if I could. This was just related to the cash level, if I were to result in the private placing, you have the second one in July, and I recognize that you are going to be paying down near those notes, but still seems like cash level is fairly high, just by design and latter this slowing economy, looking for acquisitions at potentially lower multiples and, what kind of pace should we expect if that is the case over the course of 2008, especially if we are heading towards recession, or already in recession. What kind of pace we can expect from you guys?
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well that’s… asked several questions there, once.
Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer: Sure.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: This flow is clearly resulted in funding in December and our positioning is… we are being a little conservative, it’s better to have cash on hand in these times and… than not. But from an economic standpoint it didn’t make sense for us to pay anything off earlier. It is better suited for us to keep the cash on hand and look for opportunistic uses of that cash, in the next few months, several months even if we have to and then pay the debt down later as in July when we get to that point.
Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer: Right.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Funding acquisitions is the top of our priority, that’s our number one use of cash and… so we are obviously… we have got a lot of powder in our ammunition there to use and we could spend much more than we spent this year and still not affect the leverage factors of the company.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: If I could just add to John’s comments, we view this as an opportunity in the acquisitions arena. What typically happens as the economy slows, is several things. Multiples come down, as you mentioned. Also the EBITDAs of the acquired companies tend to go down. So when you look at what you are paying for those companies, it’s a great time to buy. Also, many of the strategics, not all obviously, but many will pull in their horns in a down environment, and we view it just the opposite as a time to get more aggressive. And I think as you know we substantially increase the amount of management capability we have for acquisitions by increasing the number of people that are 100% focused on acquisitions from 4 to 10 last year and we’ve got a great backlog right now and the cash is there. Obviously we are going to be judicious in the use of the cash but we do see there’s an opportunity.
Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer: And is there an official target just to clarify, $200 million, $300 million, whatever?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: We haven’t changed our targets; it is consistent with the strategy that we have outlined for you. We have basically said it’s a $100 million, it’s a $150 million in acquisitions. But I can tell you that my goal is to do better than that, my personal goal.
Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer: Terrific, very good. Good quarter. Thank you.
John J. Molinelli - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: I just want to make one other point that I touched on earlier. Our capital structure is just absolutely rock solid. At the urging of our Board last summer, they encouraged us to get ahead of the curve from taking the steps to protect us from funding to take, clear that $225 million notes that are due next summer, that inspired us to go into the private placement market, we pushed the envelope in getting delayed fundings and the upsized that to match the growth of the company. And when we look downstream our capital structure, coupled with the cash flows of the company is just a rock solid story. So I just wanted to take that opportunity to reiterate that.
Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer: Terrific. Thanks again.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: See you then. Thanks.
Operator: We will take our next question from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Hello.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hello, Amit.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: I say the state got into a [inaudible] Research, a couple of things. You guys talked during the call regarding Lean and Six Sigma to drive your businesses. Frank, can you talk in a little more detail what you guys are doing, what’s your initiative for Lean and Six Sigma and the benefits that you’re seeing across your businesses?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Absolutely. We are very excited about the, what we have accomplished to date and what we see going forward from both Lean and Six Sigma. Six Sigma is being deployed and has been deployed in two different ways. One, focused predominantly on the business today, if you will, basically the flow of products from the material side through the production process and out to our customers. And secondly, we are focused on design for Six Sigma, which is really in the research development and engineering process, so that we bring products to market that meet our customer needs, we do that efficiently, get them in production efficiently and obviously satisfy their needs and that levers our growth. And, when you look at the margin improvement that AMETEK has done over the last really six, seven years, it’s been a fairly remarkable story. I don’t exactly remember the numbers. Bill, you probably do, but I think when we started this our margins were down in the 12% to 13% kind of region. And we are running now, starting to teeter around 20%. So it’s a phenomenal story. And although we have not quantified this as to how much is Lean, how much is Six Sigma and how much is off shore manufacturing, how much is low cost materials sourcing, et cetera et cetera, obviously Lean and Six sigma are a major part of this. So, as we go into this year and as John has mentioned, we are going to focus some of our activities on the inventory side of the company. And we are actually, we have decided to hire 11 people into the company that are going to be put in our key operations, and these will be people who have significant Lean capability focused on the material movement. And we are going to really attack that material side of the business. It will take a while to see the results because we have to hire the people, get them in place et cetera. But we see an opportunity there and we are focused on that working capital metric and see if we can make some improvements in it, and then obviously satisfy our customers at the same time to a higher degree.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: In terms of like OE and RONA, how are you guys using those metrics to look at your manufacturing blueprint, to make sure you are doing the right job at the right plant?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Oh we are always looking at our returns no matter what we do, and I think our financial reports on performance shows that. Any investment that we are making we are looking at it from a RONA viewpoint, and I think you can see that our performance has been excellent.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: And over the next year how do you, what percentage do you expect to improve on RONA? Do you have a target mark? Target you would like to achieve?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, we don’t have a specific target.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And final question, like everything I have been hearing, congratulations on a great quarter.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: How long did your continuous improvement program been in place and going forward on the next couple of years, what systems are you going to put in place to accelerate the initiatives, to make sure you guys stay number one in the market?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. I know it’s a great point. I mean, in that sense we have had these continuous efforts in place for an extended period of time, probably even before I was CEO and I have been CEO now, I think it is eight years. And so, I mean it has been a continual process, but we are continuing to augment the process and it is very important to us. The Company grows and we acquire other companies to inject that into those acquired companies, so the kinds of things we are doing is part of these 11 people that we hired, we are going to actually put a training function into the Company so that we have better capability as we acquire these companies to… in essence go out and teach them using the basic techniques of Lean, Six Sigma, other cost improvement types of initiatives. But it has an AMETEK tinge to it in terms of what we like to do and how we like to focus on and so, that’s definitely one initiative that’s going in place. Another major initiative is that we are putting a Business Analytic system in place, which sits on top of all of the IT systems we have throughout the Company, and it basically puts a dashboard on our desks that allows us to look at things that are not the typical financial metrics that we typically and very consistently look at. We could look at things like first pass yields, closing [ph] on the production lines, and things of that nature, amalgamate them and that will give our people additional focus into where the areas of opportunity are et cetera. So, those are a few of the initiatives that we have in place.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Great. Nice work, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: And our next question comes from Wendy Caplan with Wachovia.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: Thanks. Good morning.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hi, Wendy.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: A couple of quick acquisition questions. In terms of the environment, I don’t think I heard you talking about… mentioning the credit crunch and whether… you talked about strategic buyers but have you seen any impact yet, from the credit crunch and the financial buyers, backing up?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. In essence when we look back, Wendy over the acquisitions we did, we very seldom competed head-to-head with financial buyers. Usually we have got huge synergies and the deals we are acquiring is good strategic fit, so we really didn’t go head-to-head with them and I think the impact on us was more indirect in that because they were being very aggressive and there was huge amounts of capital available as we go back in time. Multiples went up on deals, so we were paying higher multiples in the last year or two than we were in other time before that, so I think the impact, as obviously that cash is not available to the same… anywhere near the same degree is that we are going to see multiples come down. As I mentioned before and I am starting to feel a little of that, but I can’t say right now that we are back to where we were before the bubble.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you. And there were a lot of acquisitions in this quarter. Have you calculated what the operating margins in the segments or on a consolidated basis would have been, excluding those acquisitions?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: No, that’s not a calculation that we do, Wendy.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: And…
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Obviously, the acquisitions are going to be dilutive to margins.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: Right.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: And in essence, our margins were up substantially. So, the base business margins are extremely good and they’ve all set back dilution. But I don’t have a number as to what that is.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. And a number I know you do calculate is the incremental margin excluding acquisitions. Can you--?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That we do
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: Do that for the quarter?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That, it was off the charts. It was well above 40% for the quarter.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. And finally, can you speak about the new 2008 Mexican tax laws and whether you expect that will help… how you expect that will affect AMETEK?
John J. Molinelli - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: We're studying that Wendy, but we don’t have a real clear picture of how that’s going to affect us and what strategies we may play, we may use to handle that. So, I can’t give you a finite answer to that.
Wendy Caplan - Wachovia Capital Markets: Okay. Well, we’ll look forward to getting it. Thank you very much.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: All right, Wendy.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Scott Graham with Bear Stearns.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: Good morning, Frank, John, Bill.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Hello Scott.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: Hey. Just a couple of questions for you all. The acquisitions that you made in 2007, and Frank, I’m not asking you for all seven, but maybe just the bigger ones, could you tell us how those businesses are performing organically? Just a bit, maybe just the bigger ones.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. See, if I think about them, the first one we did was Seacon Phoenix and that was a submarine related business, it’s not one of the bigger ones, but it’s the first one that came to mind, and that one is doing great. As a matter of fact, a part of the strong order growth and internal growth that I mentioned for the company in orders came from that particular business. So, we've won some major contracts actually with the Spanish government on their submarine fleet to equip those submarines with… basically these are interconnect systems that do cabling interconnect between the outside water and the inside of the submarine. So they’re very high pressure type devices. So, that business is doing just fine. It’s organic growth, I don’t have numbers in my head, but they’re very, very strong. Some of the larger ones, Cameca is another one in there and Cameca was about an $80 million acquisition and that business has exceeded our expectations. Organic growth has been good. They’ve had great order intakes since we bought them. There are really no issues that I can think of with that particular acquisition. What else is in there, fellows, the--?
William J. Burke - Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer: Umeco would be the only other large… that would be the only other large one and that was… really we acquired that one in November. So, it’s too early to tell…
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Right. So, it’s kind of early. I don’t know if you've heard Bill, but Umeco is kind of early because it’s November, but we have no indications of any of any issues with Umeco.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: Well, was that business rising 5% to 10% plus before you bough it?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: This is a 6% growth kind of business.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: Okay. Where some of the order rates concern, I mean, I think I heard you right, when you said 12% organic growth.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That’s right.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: In orders. Could you give me an… give us idea of what you are seeing in intake wise in the first part of January?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It looks fine. Actually, I just check yesterday, it was all the group presidents, because I knew we are going to be talking about it this morning. And all three of the group guys were very confident and they are… what they not only what they saw in terms of input so far this year, but also how they are feeling about the first quarter.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: Okay. I guess, lastly would be some of the belt tightening stuff you guys, last time things weakened, you guys were way ahead of the curve on that. And it doesn’t sound like you are doing belt tightening now. It sounds like you very much at already. Although, my question would be, John did indicate that I think you guys are expecting G&A to be flat in 2008. Is that maybe the first glimpse of a belt tightening or is that something else?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I would say it’s maybe a little bit of belt tightening but we had some spend in ’07 that just won’t repeat itself because we got some… some initiatives out of the way. So, it’s a mixture of just our normal cost conscious approach to running the business and some things behind us. Yes, we are looking at… always looking at ways to watch our spend there.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: Okay.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: If I could add to that. That what I mentioned the belt tightening in my opening remarks, we were very judicious both when we went through the budget process and as we rolled it up, and putting some pressure on our operations, recognizing the slowing economy and we really asked them to be more judicious in their spends, to look for more cost savings opportunities. It was not to the magnitude of what you are referring to, the last time we did this because of back and when was that? I guess it was year 2000 or so because our markets are strong, everything is really doing quite well right now but if I quantify that for you I would say roughly, probably $5 million of, sort of incremental additional cost savings. We didn’t go back and roll it up but I think that’s probably the rough magnitude of what we did. And again it’s purely precautionary, it’s not because we are seeing something that we have to react to.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: Okay. Very good. I do actually have one other question and that would be regarding 2008 acquisitions. I know that you guys have done just a… I think a tremendous job in improving the portfolio but if you had to name… I mean you now seem to be kind of full or approaching critical mass in your MRO area, although I am sure that there is more opportunity there but what are the other areas that you are seeing or… maybe the potential for acquisitions to be focused upon in that 2008?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I mean if I looked at where the concentration of our efforts are going, I would put the process businesses first. There is lots of potential acquisitions in that arena that fit the size range where we like to do deals and they are great businesses and they tend not to cycle as much as other businesses, so that’s the number one focus I would say for deals. In addition, aerospace and defense outside of MRO is also an area that we see great opportunity to expand our product portfolio. So, we are going to be… continuing to look for in new acquisitions in that part of the business and as I already mentioned, we have built about $100 million third party MRO business now with the three acquisitions we have done over the last year and a half plus… I guess this was about a year and a half and we see that platform to become $200 million, $300 million platform, what we are talking so, and that really puts our acquisition strategy well, because they tend to be roll-ups, you kind of tend to bring them in, consolidate facilities, give substantial cost reductions and also being in an end market obviously is doing extremely well. The Power businesses are another key area, they are very good businesses, very good markets. That’s a smaller platform, as you know for AMETEK, we have got about $150 million of concentration and we have got good management in that part of the Company and we see it as an opportunity to continue to grow that platform. And although I am asked, I mean I am really speaking to all the differentiated businesses, because that’s where we are focusing… the last is really the differentiated side of EMG. We have built a really nice platform of businesses in our EMIPS [ph] division. We started with the core specialty metals company. We added HCC. We made other additions, Hamilton Precision in 2007 and I can tell you we are looking at a bunch of deals that go into that particular arena right now, so, I mean one of the advantages of our portfolio, I would say in that we have got a number of these diverse markets and you never know when deals are going to pop and what’s going to work from a financial viewpoint, so we are going to look across that whole spectrum of differentiated businesses and just continue to deploy the capital in a very efficient manner and get the kind of returns that we all like.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: Well, since you essentially named all of your businesses, Frank, I have come to tell you that I have got very encouraging
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I didn’t name cost driven motors.
Scott Graham - Bear Stearns: Thanks.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: All right.
Operator: And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered but just had a few quick clarifications. In terms of the Final indulgence savings you expect from belt tightening, let’s call it, is that because you are going to consolidate try and do some restructuring or whether that’s going to come from?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It is a combination of things. Every year we do consolidation of facilities and we are going to do some additional ones in 2008. You heard me talk about higher low cost region sourcing, we probably wouldn’t have been quite as aggressive if we didn’t see the slowing U.S. economy. I mentioned we are going to do $40 million to $50 million of additional manufacturing in low cost regions. We will push for the $50 million instead of the $40 million so it is those and those general types of things. It’s not a major restructuring of the Company in any way, shape or form. It’s just looking at opportunities and being a little more cautious as the U.S. and to some degree the world environment is changing.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Got it. And then in terms of the low cost procurement or sourcing. We had $11 million in ’07 and $16 million in ’08. Is that right?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That is correct.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: And what is the dollar amount that we are sourcing from low cost regions today?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: It’s about $60 million.
John J. Molinelli - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Well, that’s for China. If we had expanded to other low cost areas you might add another $15 million to $20 million to that.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: All right. So $60 million to $80 million .
John J. Molinelli - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Yes.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: All right and then what is the number going to 2008?
John J. Molinelli - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: Probably another $20 million.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes.
John J. Molinelli - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: I mean we are going to still work on the $60 million, I mean we didn’t do it all so…
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: Got it. And then into low cost manufacturing, that number was around $326 million?
John J. Molinelli - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: That’s correct.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: And it is going up by $40 million to $50 million and we typically save about 20% of those savings right in…?
John J. Molinelli - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President: We say 10%, but probably our more recent performance has been closer to 20%, but the targets we have given you have been 10%.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: All right. I am still trying to look at my model and the way things look like they would end up at the mid or high end of the EPS number is about 50 basis points to 60 basis points of operating margin improvement?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Yes. You hit the number but we are saying 40 basis points to 50 basis points margin improvement.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: All right. Are you sequentially… to follow up all the savings you get, the $16 million here and low cost sourcing and the final from general belt tightening, plus the incremental margins you can draw in your organic business. You should be… I mean that seems to be like a pretty conservative place to start, I mean, is the math right there or…?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Well, remember we are in a slowing economy and we don’t want to be ultra aggressive at this point in time because none of us know exactly what’s going to happen with the economy, so we are… our numbers we think are very realistic. We think we can handle a slowing economic environment, if the environment did not further slow we probably would beat these numbers but we are assuming in our numbers are slowing economic situation.
John J. Molinelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And you got to remember too there are cost increases that are offsetting this, I mean, you have taken the one side of the equation. There is other things that your cost increases in investments as well.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: All right. Well, maybe on the cost increases part, could you guys just run down raw material if that’s been an issue, it doesn’t look like commodities have spiked up too much of late other than oil.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Commodities, I mean even when they were spiking up, it’s just… it really speaks to the strength of our Company where our operational excellence initiatives, they simply have not been a problem… we were very aggressive in alternate sourcing, very aggressive in pricing as the commodities have gone up. And now we are actually… as you mentioned enjoying an environment where they are probably going to moderate and there is opportunity as it moderates.
Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets: All right. Thanks a lot.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: [Operators Instructions]. And we will take our next question from Matt Summerville with KeyBanc.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital: Good morning. Just 2 questions. First, you mentioned pricing. How much were average selling prices up ’07 versus ’06 and then what’s your thought on 2008?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: That’s a good question Matt. We took a look at this actually, just the other day to see exactly what we had done and we were up about two percentage points in 2007 over 2006. The pricing that we have put into the budget for 2008 is the same, it’s 2%. It is going to be more difficult to get that, but we are going to be aggressive and shoot for that number.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. And then any color on organic sales growth by geography in the fourth quarter? Do you have that data?
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: I mean, it was a good picture. It was actually balanced where the organic growth internationally was about the same as the U.S. was about the same as the Company. So, it was a good picture. We are very pleased with the U.S. performance.
Matt Summerville - KeyBanc Capital: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Frank S. Hermance - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time, Mr. Burke I will turn the call back over to you.
William J. Burke - Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer: Okay. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: That would conclude today’s conference call. We appreciate your participation. Have a good day.
